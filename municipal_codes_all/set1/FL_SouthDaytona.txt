PREFACE 
Part I of this volume contains the Charter of the City, as from time to time amended. Obsolete provisions of the Charter have been deleted in this publication and the deletions appropriately noted. Also, there are frequent notes throughout the Charter directing the user's attention to provisions of general law which should be considered in interpreting the Charter. For a further discussion of the treatment of the Charter, see the footnote at the bottom of page 1. 
Part II contains the Code of Ordinances of the City. This Code is a recodification of the ordinances of South Daytona of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1966 South Daytona Code as supplemented through August 24, 1976 and ordinances adopted subsequent thereto. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1966 Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the sixth section of Chapter 5 is 5-6. New sections or even entire chapters may be inserted in their proper places, in the future simply by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 5-4 and 5-5 is to be added, the new sections would be numbered 5-4.1, 5-4.2, 5-4.3 respectively. New chapters may be included by the addition of a decimal after the chapter number. Thus, if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as Chapter 12.1. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Code with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in Section 6 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is recommended by the publishers that all amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt and that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference.

Sec. 1-14. - Purpose and intent. 
The city has established, adopted, and is guided by a number of goals, policies, and objectives to ensure that growth is managed properly and that orderly development occurs; that improvements to the existing environment are more purposefully directed; and that uncoordinated development is halted. 
The city's most general goal is the development of an excellent community in which to live, work, or visit and to provide for the public safety and welfare. In order to meet this general goal, other primary goals, which affect the following, must be met: 
(1)  Physical. Development of the city should be controlled in a manner which provides a safe, healthful, efficient, modern, attractive, and generally improved physical environment. To that end, the city should take advantage of the locally abundant natural resources without destroying them, in order to enhance the community identity. 
(2)  Social. The city should afford its citizens opportunities for enrichment of their lifestyles and the stimulation of their abilities in a pleasant, healthy, safe, and harmonious environment. 
(3)  Governmental. Municipal government should strive to provide services and direction to its constituency by the most efficient, economical, equitable, and egalitarian (i.e., full potential and social equality for all people) means possible. Its activities should encompass that which cannot or will not be adequately provided by the private sector.

(d)  Requests for documents, which may contain information that is exempt from disclosure under Florida law, may be delayed until the records can be reviewed and redacted as necessary by the custodian of the records.

Sec. 2-299. - Special masters.

In order to avoid any potential conflict of interest, it is preferable for a special master not be a resident of the city, own real property in the city or own a business with a location in the city. This requirement can be waived by the city council. Special masters shall be an active or retired lawyer, but an attorney who has been disbarred by any state bar association shall be disqualified to serve as the special master. Furthermore, a person will be disqualified to serve as a special master if the person has been convicted or has plead no contest to any felony, any crime involving personal gain or the crime of perjury. If a person is serving as special master and is charged with a crime referenced above, the person shall automatically be suspended from serving as special master until the final conclusion of the case.

(4)  Subpoena evidence to the hearings. 
(5)  Take testimony under oath. 
(6)  Issue orders having the force of law to command whatever steps are necessary to bring a violation into compliance with city codes or ordinances.

(7)  Hear appeals from city staff decisions regarding denial of a development order or the revocation of a development order pursuant to Chapter 2, Article VII, Division III (Enforcement). 
(Ord. No. 03-37, § 1, 1-13-04; Ord. No. 11-10, § 1, 7-26-11; Ord. No. 15-09 , § 3, 12-8-2015)  
Sec. 2-300. - Enforcement procedure. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the code enforcement officer to investigate complaints of violations of city codes and to initiate enforcement proceedings relative thereto.

However, a "fire safety inspector" as that term is defined in F.S. § 633.052, shall provide the violator a minimum time period of forty-five (45) days to correct the violation, except for major structural changes, which may be corrected within an extended adequate period of time. A Life Safety Code violation as per National Fire Prevention Codes may be ordered to comply in less than forty-five (45) days. In the event the violation continues to exist beyond the time specified for correction, the code enforcement officer shall issue a citation to the violator in accordance with the requirements of section 2-301. 
(c)  The case may be presented to a special master even if the violation has been corrected prior to the hearing but after the initial time period for compliance. The special master shall have the right to levy a fine for each day the violation was in existence beginning with the date of the citation through the date the code enforcement officer confirms compliance. It is the responsibility of the violator to notify the city that the violation has been corrected. The violation will be deemed to have continued until the code enforcement officer has determined that the violation has been corrected. 
(d)  If a repeat violation is found, the code enforcement officer shall notify the violator in writing and advise him or her of the nature of the repeat violation, but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the repeat violation. The code enforcement officer shall, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, issue a citation to the violator in accordance with the requirements of section 2-301. The case may be presented to a special master even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the hearing. The special master shall have the authority to levy a per day fine beginning on the day that the violation was first observed by the code enforcement officer until the violation is corrected. 
(e)  If a code enforcement officer has reason to believe a violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, a code enforcement officer shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violation of the same and may immediately issue a citation and schedule the matter for a hearing before a special master. 
(f)  Each day that a violation exists shall constitute a separate violation for the purpose of assessing a fine by a special master. 
(g)  All fines imposed pursuant to this article shall be paid to the city through its finance department and shall be paid by cash or check with coins only being accepted for any amounts which may require change to pay the exact amount.

(7)  The name, work phone number and work address of the code enforcement officer. That it is the responsibility of the person to contact the city for an inspection when the violation is corrected. The violation will be deemed to be in existence until the code enforcement officer determines that the violation has been corrected. 
(8)  The date, time and place the special master hearing will be conducted. 
(9)  A conspicuous statement that if the person fails to appear at the special master hearing to contest the violation, the person shall be deemed an admission that the violation exists. 
(10)  A statement that the alleged violator is responsible for providing a court reporter at the hearing if the violator intends to appeal the determination of the special master. 
(b)  After issuing a citation to an alleged violator, the code enforcement officer shall deposit the original citation in a file for the special master, and shall deposit one (1) copy thereof with the city's finance director. 
(c)  Any person who willfully refuses to sign and accept a citation issued by a code enforcement officer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in F.S. §§ 775.082 or 775.083. 
(Ord. No. 03-37, § 1, 1-13-04)  
Sec. 2-302. - Conduct of hearing. 
(a)  Special master hearings should be held once a month, but may be held more or less often as the demand necessitates. Minutes shall be kept of all special master hearings and all such hearings shall be open to the public. The city manager or his designee shall provide clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably required for the proper performance of his or her duties. At any hearing, a special master may continue any matter to a future hearing date. 
(b)  Each case before a special master shall be presented by a code enforcement officer, a member of the city's administrative staff, or the city attorney, any assistant city attorney, or any special counsel. The city attorney may present the case before the special master or serve as council to the special master, but cannot perform both functions on a single case. If the city prevails in prosecuting a case before a special master, it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the said case and such costs may be added to the fine and become part of any lien authorized under section 2-303. 
(c)  A special master shall proceed to hear the cases on the agenda for the respective hearing. All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, however, fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern all proceedings. Both the city and the alleged violator shall have the right to subpoena witnesses to testify at the hearing. 
(d)  A special master shall advise the alleged violator of the section of the code of which he or she is accused of violating and the nature of the violation. A special master shall first seek to determine whether or not the alleged violator admits the violation. If the alleged violator admits the violation, the special master shall hear such testimony and evidence as he or she deems necessary to determine the extent of the violation and appropriate fine amount. If the alleged violator denies the violation, the special master shall hear first from the city and any city witnesses and evidence, and the alleged violator shall have the right to cross-examine city witnesses. At the close of the presentation of the city's case against the alleged violator, the violator shall be permitted to present his evidence, testimony of other witnesses and his own testimony in his defense. The city shall have the right to cross-examine the alleged violator and his or her witnesses. The city shall have the burden of proving the violation by a preponderance of the evidence. 
(e)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the special master shall issue findings of fact, conclusions of law and order imposing fine based on the evidence of record, and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with the powers granted herein. If the special master finds the person in violation, the special master shall establish a per day fine amount that may begin accruing on the date the citation was issued and shall continue accruing until the violation is corrected. A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of Volusia County and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest or assigns. Upon compliance and payment of the fine, the city shall record an order acknowledging compliance of the code violation and satisfaction of the fine. A hearing is not required for the issuance of such an order acknowledging compliance. 
(Ord. No. 03-37, § 1, 1-13-04)  
Sec. 2-303. - Administrative fines and liens. 
(a)  Amount of fine. A special master may impose a fine up to the maximum amount described in this subparagraph as provided below: 
(1)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for the first violation and shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for a repeat violation; and, in addition thereto, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. However, if a special master finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, he or she may impose a fine not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per day per violation. 
(2)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, a special master shall consider the following factors: 
a.  The gravity of the violation; 
b.  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
c.  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(3)  Each day a violation exists shall constitute a separate violation for the purpose of assessing such fine. 
(b)  Reduction of fine. The special master shall have the right to reduce a code fine pursuant to the following procedure: 
(1)  The violation(s) for which the code fine is related must be corrected. The city staff must inspect the property and file with the special master a notice of compliance. 
(2)  The property owner or representative must submit in writing to the city a request to be placed on the special master agenda for a fine reduction request. 
(3)  City staff shall submit a written recommendation to the special master regarding the requested fine reduction and set the fine reduction request on the special master agenda. The special master shall only consider a fine reduction that has been placed on the agenda unless the city otherwise consents. 
(4)  In considering the whether to grant a fine reduction and the amount of the reduction, the guiding principal should be the city's primary goal in code enforcement is to attain code compliance and to recoup the expenses incurred by the city. The special master shall consider all factors considered relevant in making such a determination, including but not limited to, the following: 
a.  The costs incurred by the city in investigating and prosecuting the code violation, including staff time, recording costs and attorney fee. 
b.  The responsiveness and cooperation of the property owner in correcting the violation and mitigating reasons for any lack of cooperation such as age, physical disabilities or financial limitations. 
c.  Prior code enforcement actions by the city against the same owner or an entity directly or indirectly under the control of the same person. 
(5)  The city manager shall have the authority to issue lien releases without the special master's approval as long as a fine reduction is not associated with the lien release. 
(c)  Lien for unpaid fine. A certified copy of the findings of fact, conclusions of law and order imposing fine may be recorded in the public records of Volusia County and shall thereafter constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the city and the city manager may authorize the execution of a satisfaction and release of lien entered pursuant to this article. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this section may be foreclosed on real property that is a homestead under Section 4, Article X of the Florida Constitution.

c.  After 2:00 a.m., all lighted signage on the exterior of the premises shall be turned off. However, any exterior lighting used to illuminate common areas such as walkways, parking lots, sidewalks, or areas of customer ingress and egress may remain illuminated. 
(5)  The extended hours of operation permit must be renewed annually unless the permit has been suspended or revoked by the special magistrate or the alcoholic beverage establishment's state beverage license has been suspended or revoked. If there has been a change in ownership or a change in location of the establishment, the permits and licensing division must be notified immediately and a new application must be processed. Failure to amend the application for the extended hours of operation permit as required herein shall be cause for the immediate suspension of extended hours privileges pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section. The permit is not transferable or assignable. 
(6)  Permit suspension or revocation. The ability to remain open and sell or permit the consumption of alcoholic beverages beyond the hour of 12:00 midnight is hereby declared to be and is a privilege subject to suspension or revocation by the special magistrate, and no person may reasonably rely on a continuation of that privilege. As a condition of the continuation of the privilege, alcoholic beverage establishments are required to take all necessary steps to minimize the negative impacts that their establishment may cause in nearby residential or commercial neighborhoods, or on city resources. The special magistrate shall consider the following in deciding whether to suspend, revoke, or condition the privilege: 
a.  Increased demand on law enforcement activities on the alcoholic beverage establishment's property during the extra hours of operation, both outside and inside the permitted location, with particular emphasis on vandalism, and illegal activity of any kind by employees, patrons, or others associated with the establishment, including but not limited to, allowing underage drinking, violation of open container laws and loitering by intoxicated individuals. The special magistrate shall consider the number and nature (gravity) of the calls for service; 
b.  Code violations arising from adverse effects extra hours of operation have upon neighboring properties, including but not limited to, the effects of noise, illegal parking, vandalism, generation of trash or garbage, loitering by intoxicated persons or exterior lighting on neighboring residential properties; 
c.  Violations of the city's Code provisions regulating noise, as referenced in chapter 10, article III; 
d.  Failure to obtain an extended hours of operation permit, or failure to comply with the restrictions set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)—(5) of this section or any conditions imposed on a permit pursuant to section (8); 
e.  Violations of laws relating to the maximum permissible occupancy of the establishment; 
f.  Violation of any other provision of this Code, city's land development regulations, or any state or federal law. 
In order to invoke the enforcement provisions of this section, the activities described herein above must result from the operation of the particular establishment against whom action is being taken, and also must be verified by either a police or a code enforcement officer. 
(7)  A violation notice shall be issued to any alcoholic beverage establishment that fails to meet any of the criteria established in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. The notice of violation shall be left with the owner, proprietor, or highest-ranking employee then on the premises. An additional copy of the notice will also be mailed via U.S. mail, certified, return receipt requested, to the alcoholic beverage establishment at the street address provided in the application. Proof of delivery by either of these two (2) methods (hand delivery or mail) shall be sufficient to establish receipt of the permit-holder. Notices sent by mail that are returned or not accepted for any reason shall be deemed proper notice of the violation, provided that the notice is sent to the person and address named on the application. 
(8)  If the special magistrate finds a violation of one (1) or more of the criteria outlined in (b)(6) above, in addition to any order, fine or penalty that is within the special magistrate discretion, the special magistrate may also consider the suspension or revocation of the permit. The suspension or revocation shall be for a period of time as determined at the discretion of the special magistrate after considering all evidence and mitigating factors, such as negative impacts to neighbors and prior efforts by the establishment to reduce or prevent the violations. 
a.  The special magistrate may require, as a condition of the continuation of the privilege of extra hours of operation, compliance with any reasonable conditions determined to be necessary to mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects proven to the special magistrate of such extra hours. These conditions may include, without being limited to, provision by the owner or operator of the premises to provide, at the owner or operator's expense, additional off-street parking, security personnel, trash maintenance and screening and buffering from nearby properties. 
(9)  Any alcoholic beverage establishment that has had an extended hours of operation permit suspended, revoked, or otherwise conditioned cannot avoid the consequences of the special magistrate's action by changing its name or corporate status. Upon a showing to the city that there has been a legitimate change in ownership at the location effected by the special magistrate's action(s), the city may consider allowing an extended hours of operation permit to issue at the site, subject to applicable conditions, if any, to prevent a recurrence of the harms that caused the earlier action. 
(10)  The fee for the permit required by this subsection, and for permit renewal, shall be fifty dollars ($50.00).

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 3.5-31. - Title. 
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Adult Entertainment Code". 
(Ord. No. 96-10, § 1(1), 6-25-96)  
Sec. 3.5-32. - Authority. 
This code [article] is enacted under the home rule power of the city, in the interest of the health, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city and under the authority of the city, to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages under the Twenty-first Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
(Ord. No. 96-10, § 1(2), 6-25-96)  
Sec. 3.5-33. - Scope. 
This adult entertainment code [article] shall be effective within the city limits. 
(Ord. No. 96-10, § 1(3), 6-25-96)  
Sec. 3.5-34. - Purpose. 
The intent of the city council in adopting this code [article] is to establish reasonable and uniform regulations for the adult entertainment industry that will protect the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the city. It is not the intent of the city council to legislate with respect to matters of obscenity; such matters are regulated by federal and state law, including Chapter 847 of the Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 96-10, § 1(4), 6-25-96)  
Sec. 3.5-35. - Findings of facts. 
The city council adopts this code [article] based on evidence and testimony presented at public hearings before the city council and on the findings incorporated in the United States Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986), the Jacksonville Ordinance Code, Chapter 410, Ord. 77-257-256, Section 1, the Los Angeles Municipal Code, Section 12.70, Ord. 156509 (1982), the Detroit Zoning Ordinance, 66,0000, Ord. 742-G, Section 1, 10-24-72, and "A Summary of a National Survey of Real Estate Appraisers Regarding the Effect of Adult Bookstores on Property Values," conducted by the Division of Planning, Department of Metropolitan Development, Indianapolis, January 1984, and the findings of fact set out in Section 3-5 of the Adult Entertainment Code of Orange County, Florida, a county in Central Florida, and findings of the City of Daytona Beach. 
(1)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the City and other nearby cities or counties in East Central Florida where books, magazines, periodicals or other printed material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, videotapes, slides, or other visual representations or recordings, or other audio matter, or instruments, novelties, devices, or paraphernalia which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas are possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold. 
(2)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities or counties in East Central Florida where dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas, or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers. 
(3)  The activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur at establishments which operate for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the health, safety, economy, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the city. A major industry which is important to the community's economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to visit attractions who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere. 
(4)  When the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) are present in establishments, other activities which are illegal, unsafe, or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property. 
(5)  When the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) are competitively exploited in establishments, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the particular crimes described in subsection (4), and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(6)  The establishments in which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur often are constructed, in part or in whole, of substandard materials, maintained in a manner reflecting disregard for the health and safety of the occupants, and have exterior signs or appearance that lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline. 
(7)  The activities described in subsections (1) and (2) often occur in establishments concurrent with the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
(8)  The concurrence of the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community. 
(9)  The concurrence of the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) creates additional hazards to the health and safety of persons in attendance and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property, harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life, tone of commerce, and community environment. 
(10)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the city, it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages at establishments where the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur. 
(11)  Employees of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than employees of other establishments. 
(12)  Physical contact or touching within establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur between employees exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
(13)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city, it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, employees, entertainers, performers, and customers at establishments where the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur. 
(14)  The potential dangers to the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting an establishment at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this code [article] are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate. 
(15)  Requiring operators of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur to keep a list of information concerning current employees and certain recent past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects, and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(16)  Prohibiting establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur from operating within set distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, residences, areas zoned or designated for residential use, and parks, at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect minors from the adverse affects of the activities that accompany such establishments. 
(17)  Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, and enclosed adult booths in establishments at which the activities described in subsection (1) and (2) occur have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers and pose a threat to the health of the participants and promote the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression.

An adult performance establishment shall not be deemed a place provided or set apart for the purpose of exposing or exhibiting a person's sexual organs in a manner contrary to the first sentence of Section 800.03, Florida Statutes, the state's indecent exposure statute as set forth in the decision of the Supreme Court of Florida in the case of Hoffman v.

DIVISION 4. - ALLOCATION OF MOTORIZED BOAT SLIPS ALONG THE HALIFAX RIVER[7] 

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 07-01, § 1, adopted January 23, 2007, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion herein as Div. 4, §§ 5-300, 5-301, was at the discretion of the editor. See also the Code Comparative Table. 
 
Sec. 5-300. - Intent. 
The purpose and intent of these regulations are to fairly and reasonably allocate the total motorized boat slips (boat slips) allotted to the City of South Daytona (city) pursuant to the Volusia County Manatee Protection Plan (plan) so as to assure that adequate numbers of boat slips are available for public use, private residential multi-family docks, and single-family residences along the Halifax River. Furthermore, the city shall designate the public projects that will provide the net positive public benefit for private residential multi-family docks that preempt more than forty (40) square feet of sovereign submerged lands for each one (1) linear foot of common riparian shoreline along sovereign submerged land of the Halifax River (i.e. "the 40:1 rule"). 
(Ord. No. 07-01, § 1, 1-23-07)  
Sec. 5-301. - Boat slip allocation. 
All of the boat slips allotted to the city pursuant to the plan shall be allocated as follows: 
(1)  There will be allocated to waterfront single-family residential properties the number of boat slips required by law. 
(2)  There shall be one (1) boat slip set aside for each existing boat trailer parking place located at public riverfront boat ramps within the city limits. 
(3)  There shall be set aside fifty (50) boat slips for future public marinas and/or additional boat trailer parking at public riverfront boat ramps within the city. 
(4)  Each private residential multi-family dock shall be allocated the number of boat slips allowed within a preempted area as per the state's 40:1 rule. If the 40:1 rule is modified or amended by the state to allow a lesser or greater amount of preempted area without requiring a showing of net positive public benefit or other criteria, then the number of allocated boat slips shall be adjusted accordingly. Private residential multi-family docks with an approved allocation of boat slips pursuant to these regulations shall be deemed grandfathered if the state law is subsequently modified, in order to allow the already approved number of boat slips to remain in existence into the future, and to be repaired or rebuilt if damaged or destroyed. 
(5)  If a private residential multi-family dock intends to preempt more submerged land than allowed under the 40:1 rule, the additional boat slips that will be located within this additional preempted area shall be allocated to the owner on the basis of net positive public benefit if: 
a.  The owner of the dock contributes a proportionate fair-share towards the public projects designated by the city; and 
b.  The number of remaining boat slips within the total city allocation is sufficient to satisfy the request. If the number of boat slips remaining in the city's allocation under the plan is insufficient, the city shall allocate only the number of remaining slips. 
(6)  a.  The city may impose impact fees or other proportionate fair share exactions upon the upland properties to which new or additional boat slips are allocated after the adoption of this ordinance, for the purpose of the reconstruction of a channel parallel to the city's shoreline, and one (1) or more access channels between that channel and the Intracoastal Waterway. Such fees or exactions may include a surcharge per slip for private multi-family residential slips to the extent the additional boats slips are used to occupy submerged land in excess of that allowed under the 40:1 rule. It is the intent of the city that the surcharge shall satisfy the net positive public benefit requirement under state law. 
b.  The city may further impose recurring special assessments in the manner allowed by law for the continuing maintenance of channels, upon all riparian properties specially benefited by the establishment and maintenance of improved navigational access. 
c.  The city shall utilize all exactions, impact fees or proportionate fair share contribution hereafter imposed on those properties to which boat slips are allocated under subparagraph (a) for the purposes of constructing and improving nonexclusive public navigational access between the public and private waterfront lands within the city, and the publicly maintained channels including the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. The city may utilize the receipts of any surcharge imposed under subparagraph (a) for such projects or for other projects creating a public benefit, including but not limited to manatee protection. The city shall utilize the receipts of any continuing special assessment for the purposes of said assessment. 
(7)  The city shall establish a separate fund to deposit and hold the funds to be used for the construction, maintenance, repair and/or expansion of the public projects. The city retains the right to use said funds for other qualifying public projects that may be designated by the city after the financial contribution is made. 
(8)  It is the intent that all references to "public projects" shall mean public projects that have the effect of maintaining or increasing the public's access to sovereign submerged lands as required by state law. 
(9)  The city shall designate the public projects and establish the financial contribution to be paid towards the construction, maintenance, repair and/or expansion of said public projects by resolution adopted by the city council.

ARTICLE XIV. - RECREATIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
 
Sec. 5-304. - Statement of purpose. 
(a)  The provision of adequate recreational space and facilities is an integral part of the city's plan for enhancing the health and general welfare of its citizens. The city council desires to fund recreational facilities necessitated by new growth through the accepted practice of impact fees on new development. The city council, in conjunction with the land development regulation board and the recreation advisory board, have carefully considered the future recreational needs of the city. 
(b)  The purpose of this section is to establish a recreational development impact fee to be paid for each residential dwelling unit to be constructed in the city subsequent to the adoption of this section (new development). This fee is charged to cover the proportionate cost of the acquisition and development of land and construction of new facilities necessary to meet the need for city parkland and recreation areas created by new development in order to provide a city recreation system which will be available to and substantially benefit the residents of such new development.

ARTICLE III. - EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION 
 
Sec. 6-40. - Public safety eight hundred MHz radio amplification system. 
(a)  [ Adequate radio coverage required. ] All new structures, which exceed five thousand (5,000) square feet and that upon testing are shown to interfere with the emergency communications system shall provide adequate radio coverage for the Volusia County Eight Hundred (800) MHz Radio Communications System, including but not limited to firefighters, police officers and emergency medical service providers. For purposes of this section, adequate radio coverage shall include all of the following: 
(1)  A minimum signal strength of -95 dBm available in ninety-five (95) percent of the area of each floor of the building when transmitted from the Volusia County Eight Hundred (800) MHz Radio Communications System. 
(2)  A minimum signal strength of -95 dBm received at the closest Volusia County Eight Hundred (800) MHz Radio Communications Site when transmitted from ninety-five (95) percent of the area of each floor of the building. 
(3)  The frequency range shall be eight hundred six (806) to eight hundred twenty-five (825) MHz transmit and eight hundred fifty-one (851) to eight hundred seventy (870) receiver, with a ninety-five (95) percent reliability factor. 
(b)  [ Buildings and structures which cannot support the required level of radio coverage. ] Buildings and structures which cannot support the required level of radio coverage shall be equipped with any of the following in order to achieve the required adequate radio coverage: (1) a radiating cable system; or (2) an internal multiple antenna system with or without FCC type accepted bi-directional eight hundred (800) MHz amplifiers. If any part of the installed system or systems contains an electrically powered component, the system shall be capable of operating on an independent battery and/or generator system for a period of at least twelve (12) hours without external power input, which must be installed as part of the system. The battery system shall automatically charge in the presence of an external power input. 
(c)  Acceptance test procedure. When an in-building radio system is required, and upon completion of installations, it will be the building owner's responsibility to have the radio system tested to ensure that two-way coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of ninety-five (95) percent. Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of approximately twenty (20) equal areas. A maximum of one (1) grid per floor will be allowed to fail the test. If the system fails to satisfy the minimum coverage requirements, it will be the building owner's responsibility to have the system altered to meet the minimum coverage requirements. The test shall be conducted using an EDACS portable radio, talking through the Volusia County MHz Radio Communications System (VCRCS). A spot located approximately in the center of each grid area will be selected for the test and the radio will be keyed to verify two-way communications to and from the outside of the building through the VCRCS. Once the spot has been selected within a grid area, prospecting for a better spot within said grid area will not be permitted. The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test measurement results shall be kept on file with building owner so that the measurements can be verified each year during the annual tests. In the event that the measurements result become lost, the building owner will be required to re-run the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values. 
(d)  Annual test. When an in-building radio is required, it shall be the building owner's responsibility to have all active components of the system, such as amplifiers and power supplies and backup batteries, tested a minimum of once every twelve (12) months. Amplifiers shall be tested to ensure that the gain remains within the manufacturer tolerances. Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load to verify that they will properly operate during an actual power outage. All other active components shall be checked to determine that they are operating within the manufacturer specifications for the intended purpose. 
(e)  Test records. All tests shall be documented and signed by the chief of police or the fire chief, or a designee from either. All test records shall be retained on the inspected premises by the building owner or tenant and shall be subject to inspection by fire department official upon request. 
(f)  Field testing. Police and fire personnel, after providing reasonable notice to the building owner or tenant, shall have the right to enter onto the property to conduct field-testing to be certain that the required level of radio coverage is present. 
(g)  [ Compliance. ] All buildings with a valid certificate of occupancy issued as of effective date of this article, shall not be required to comply with the provisions of this article.

(2)  The applicant will state whether it is a processor, a transporter, or both. 
(3)  The application must be accompanied by each of the following: 
a.  A copy of state certification as required by F.S. § 403.7046. 
b.  Disclosure of ownership as set forth below. 
c.  Proof of insurance as set forth below.

(d)  Operating requirements for registrants. Registrants will comply with the following operating requirements: 
(1)  Disclosure of ownership. A registrant will annually provide two (2) copies of a notarized statement disclosing the names of its owners, general and limited partners, or corporate or registered name under which it will conduct its business as authorized by this section. 
(2)  Service standards. A registrant will handle recovered materials containers with reasonable care and return them to the approximate location from which they were collected. A registrant will clean up all materials spilled during its collection operation. A registrant will use trucks that are capable of preventing spillage or accidental release of recovered material during transport. 
(3)  Emergencies. A registrant will not be required to provide collection services when all appropriate recycling sites are closed or a city emergency or imminent emergency exists, as determined by the city manager. The registrant will resume collections on the instruction of the city manager. 
(4)  Non-agency. A registrant will not be deemed an agent of the city and will be responsible for any losses or damages of any kind arising from its performance or nonperformance under its registration. The registrant will defend at its own expense or reimburse the city for its defense, at the city's option, of any and all claims and suits brought against the city, its elected or appointed officers, employees, and agents resulting from the registrant's performance or nonperformance of service pursuant to the registration.

(2)  The council specifically finds that the city fire rescue system and city police system benefit all residents of the city and, therefore, the fire impact fee and police impact fee shall be imposed in all incorporated areas of the city. 
(3)  Development and redevelopment necessitated by the growth contemplated in the comprehensive plan and the impact fee studies adopted in section 8.5-24 will require improvements and additions to the city fire rescue system and city police system to accommodate the new development generated by such growth and maintain the standards of service provided by the city. 
(4)  Future growth, as represented by impact construction, should contribute its fair share to the cost of improvements and additions to the city fire rescue system and city police system that are required to accommodate the impact generated by such growth. 
(5)  The required improvements and additions to the city fire rescue system and city police system needed to eliminate any deficiencies shall be financed by revenue sources of the city other than impact fees. 
(6)  Implementation of the impact fees to require impact construction within the city to contribute its fair share to the cost of required capital improvements is an integral and vital element of the regulatory plan of growth management of the city. 
(7)  The council expressly finds that the improvements and additions to the city fire rescue system and city police system to be funded by the fire impact fee and police impact fee, respectively, provide a benefit to all impact construction within the city that is in excess of the actual impact fees. 
(8)  The purpose of this article is to regulate the development of land within the city by requiring payment of impact fees by impact construction and to provide for the cost of capital improvements to the city fire rescue system and city police system which are required to accommodate such growth. This article shall not be construed to permit the collection of impact fees in excess of the amount reasonably anticipated to offset the demand on the city fire rescue system and city police system generated by such applicable impact construction.

(Ord. No. 94-23, § 2, 1-10-95; Ord. No. 18-11 , § 1, 7-10-18)  
Sec. 10-32. - Maximum decibel levels. 
(a)  General principle. No person shall operate or cause to be operated any source of sound from any property in such a manner as to create a sound level which exceeds the limits as set forth in either Table I below or Special Principle No. (5) below for the applicable zoning district for more than ten per cent (10%) of any measurement period, which shall not be less than ten (10) minutes, when measured at or beyond the property boundary of the site from which the sound emanates. 
TABLE I 
THRESHOLD DECIBEL LIMITS BY ZONE AND TIME OF DAY 
Zoning Districts 	Time 	Threshold Decibel Limit 
Commercial (BGC, BPO, BHC only) 	7:00 a.m.—10:00 p.m. 
10:00 p.m.—7:00 a.m. 	65 
  
55 
Light Industrial 	All times 	75 
All other districts 	7:00 a.m.—10:00 p.m. 
10:00 p.m.—7:00 a.m. 	60 
  
50 
 
(b)  Special principles. 
(1)  When there is more than one (1) unit within a single structure, such as with a strip center or an apartment building, the decibel level will be measured from the unit of the complainant. 
(2)  Sound or noise projecting from one (1) zoning district into another zoning district with a different decibel level limit shall not exceed the limits of the zoning district into which the noise is being projected. 
(3)  Property being used for a grandfathered nonconforming use shall be governed by the decibel limits for the zoning classification in which said use would be permitted. 
(4)  All sound level measurements made under the provisions of this article shall be made with a sound level meter as defined herein. 
(5)  When the established ambient noise level is slightly below or above the threshold limit of Table I: If possible, for any particular suspected noise producing source, the city representative shall determine and establish the ambient noise levels for certain times of the day for certain locations in the vicinity of the source during a period when the suspected noise source is not operating. If the ambient noise levels thereby established fall within a range of between two (2) decibels below the applicable threshold level of Table I and five (5) dB above it, the sound level measured when the noise is being produced shall be compared with the established ambient noise level instead of with the threshold level. In such a case, the noise level contributed to by the suspected source shall be allowed to exceed the established ambient noise level by up to three (3) decibels. 
Examples: If the applicable threshold decibel limit is fifty-five (55) dB, but the ambient noise level is established at sixty (60) dB, the noise level tolerated would be up to sixty-three (63) dB, above which level a violation would exist; or if the decibel threshold is sixty-five (65) dB and the established ambient level is sixty-three (63) dB, the noise level tolerated would be up to sixty-six (66) dB, above which level a violation would exist; or if the applicable threshold decibel limit is sixty-five (65) dB, but the ambient noise level established is fifty-five (55) dB, the noise level tolerated would be up to the threshold limit of sixty-five (65) dB. 
(Ord. No. 94-23, § 2, 1-10-95; Ord. No. 18-11 , § 1, 7-10-18)  
Sec. 10-33. - Noises prohibited. 
It shall be a violation of this section for any person to make, continue, or cause to be made or continued a noise disturbance that is plainly audible even if the decibel levels established in section 10-32 are not violated. The following standards may be considered in determining whether a violation of this section exists: 
(1)  The volume of the noise. 
(2)  The intensity of the noise. 
(3)  Time of day of the noise. 
(4)  Time duration of the noise. 
(5)  Whether the nature of the noise is usual or unusual. 
(6)  The volume and intensity of the background noise, if any. 
(7)  The proximity of the noise to residential areas. 
(8)  The nature and zoning of the area from which the noise emanates. 
(9)  The nature and zoning of the receiving land. 
With the exceptions provided in this article and state law, the following noises are prohibited notwithstanding the fact that there is no violation of section 10-32. 
(1)  Horns, signaling devices, etc. The sound of any horn or signaling device on any automobile or other vehicle, except as a danger warning; the sounding of any horn or signaling device for any unreasonable period of time; and the unreasonable use of any such device. 
(2)  Defective vehicle. The use of any automobile, motorcycle or other vehicle so out of repair, so loaded or in such manner as to create loud and unreasonable grating, grinding, rattling or other noises. 
(3)  Loading, unloading, opening boxes. Loading, unloading, opening, closing or other handling of boxes, crates, containers, building materials, garbage cans or similar objects between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. in such a manner as to cause a noise disturbance across a residential real property boundary. 
(4)  Construction. Operating or permitting the operation of any tools or equipment in construction, drilling or demolition work between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. any day of the week throughout the year, except Sunday; on Sunday such activities shall not begin before 10:00 a.m. nor last beyond 7:00 p.m. except for emergency work. 
(5)  Radios, television sets, musical instruments, and similar devices. It shall be a violation of this section to use, operate, or permit to be played, used, or operated any radio receiving set, musical instrument, television set, stereo set, cassette player, compact-disc player, sound amplifier, loudspeaker or other machine or electronic device for the production or reproduction of sound in a manner which creates a noise disturbance which is plainly audible across any real property line. 
(6)  Radios and similar devices within motorized vehicles. It shall be a violation of this section to use, operate, or permit to be played, used or operated any radio receiving set, musical instrument, television set, stereo set, cassette player, compact disc player, sound amplifier or other machine or electronic device for the production or reproduction of sound which is associated with a motor vehicle in a manner which creates a noise disturbance which is plainly audible one hundred (100) feet or more from such device when operated on a public right-of-way or public property. 
Any law enforcement officer who hears a sound that is plainly audible, as defined herein, shall be entitled to measure the sound according to the following standards: 
a.  The primary means of detection shall be by means of the officer's ordinary auditory senses, so long as the officer's hearing is not enhanced by any mechanical devices, such as microphones or hearing aids. 
b.  The officer must have a direct line of sight and hearing to the motor vehicle producing the sound so that the officer can readily identify the offending motor vehicle and the distance involved. 
c.  The officer need not determine the particular words, or phrases being produced or the name of any song or artist producing the sound. The detection of the rhythmic or pulsating bass reverberating type sound is sufficient to constitute as plainly audible sound. 
d.  The motor vehicle from which the sound is produced must be located upon (stopped, standing, or moving) any street or highway as defined by F.S. § 316.003(53). Parking lots and driveways are included when any part thereof is open to the public for purpose of vehicular traffic. 
(7)  Engine mufflers. It shall be a violation of this section to operate any internal combustion engine, including such an engine associated with a motorcycle or motor vehicle, without a muffler or other device, at least as effective as the manufacturer's original equipment, which will effectively prevent loud or explosive noises. 
(8)  Animals and birds. It shall be a violation of this section for the owner or custodian of any animal or bird, other than a farm animal on real property zoned for agricultural use, to allow that animal or bird to frequently or continuously howl, bark, meow, squawk or make other sounds indigenous to such animal which creates a noise disturbance which is plainly audible across a residential, commercial or industrial real property line. It shall be a violation of this section for the owner or custodian of any dog to allow that dog to bark, bay, cry, howl or make any other similar noise continuously for a period of five (5) minutes or bark intermittently for fifteen (15) minutes or more to the disturbance of any person at any time, day or night, regardless of whether the dog is physically situated in or upon private property. It shall not be a violation of this section, however, for any animal or bird to give a sound of danger warning under circumstances reasonably requiring the need for a warning. 
(9)  Vehicle, vessel, and motor repair in or abutting residential areas. It shall be a violation of this section to repair, rebuild or test any motor vehicle, vessel or motor between the hours of 9:00 p.m. of one day and 7:00 a.m. of the next day on property within or abutting any residential zoning district or residential area in such a manner as to cause a noise disturbance which is plainly audible across a real property line of any residential zoning district or residential area. 
(10)  Skateboard ramps. It shall be a violation of this section to use any skateboard ramp or similar device between 9:00 p.m. of one day and 7:00 a.m. of the next day in a residential zoning district or residential area in a manner which results in a noise disturbance that is plainly audible across a real property line of any residential zoning district or residential area. 
(11)  Air-blow cleaners. It shall be a violation of this section for any person to operate any air-blow cleaning equipment or similar device for the cleaning of parking lots, walkways, driveway or similar areas between the hours of 9:00 p.m. of one day and 7:00 a.m. of the next day that would result in a noise disturbance that is plainly audible across a real property line of any residential zoning district or residential area. 
(12)  Portable mechanical equipment. It shall be a violation of this section to use or operate any power tools or portable mechanical equipment, including a power saw, sander, drill, grinder, lawn or garden tool, or similar device, when used outdoors in residential areas between the hours of 8:00 p.m. of one day and 7:00 a.m. of the next day so as to cause a noise disturbance that is plainly audible across a real property line of any residential zoning district or residential area, except when emergency repairs are made to public utilities or to private property to prevent immediate threats to the health, safety and welfare of the public, occupants or owner of private property. 
(13)  Places of public entertainment. It shall be a violation of this section for any public entertainment establishment or person associated with or working for a public entertainment establishment to operate, play or permit the operation or playing of any radio receiving set, musical instrument, television set, stereo set, cassette player, compact disc player, sound amplifier or other machine or device for the production or reproduction of a sound between the hours of 10:00 p.m. of one day and 7:00 a.m. of the next day in such a manner as to create a noise disturbance that is plainly audible across a real property line of any residential zoning district or residential area. Public entertainment establishment is defined as any location or facility where individuals gather such as restaurants, bars, private clubs, club houses, community centers, public parks or similar gathering places whether open to the public or limited to members only. 
(14)  [Amplified or non-amplified noise from individuals.] Amplified or non-amplified noise from individuals gathering, talking, laughing, etc. in open, outside spaces such as parking lots or similar open, outdoor space that creates a noise disturbance that is plainly audible. 
(15)  Unnecessary noise from the operation of any motor vehicles. The city hereby prohibits the unnecessary and excessive revving of any motor vehicle while operating within the corporate limits of the city, whether on public or private property. The revving of the engine shall be deemed unnecessary and excessive if said revving is not reasonably necessary for the normal, safe operation of said vehicle or the maintenance/repair of same. This includes but is not limited to the revving of a motor cycle engine while the vehicle is not in motion. Violators of this section shall be issued a notice to appear and will be fined the maximum amount allowed under the law. 
(Ord. No. 94-23, § 2, 1-10-95; Ord. No. 18-11 , § 1, 7-10-18)  
Sec. 10-34. - Exempt noises. 
The following uses and activities shall be exempt from noise level regulations: 
(1)  Lawn maintenance and agricultural equipment between 7:00 a.m. and the earlier of sunset or 8:00 p.m. when operated with all the manufacturer's standard mufflers and noise-reducing equipment in use and in proper operating condition. 
(2)  Non-amplified crowd noise and an amplified announcer voice for a sporting event resulting from activities such as those sponsored by school, church, governmental or community groups, when held in an appropriate zoning district between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. 
(3)  Noises of safety signals, warning devices, emergency relief valves and bells and chimes of churches. 
(4)  Noises resulting from any authorized emergency vehicle when responding to an emergency call or acting in time of an emergency. Emergency vehicles are encouraged to avoid using local roads and collector roads except when necessary to arrive at the scene of the emergency. These roads are typically in residential areas, with children playing and with the lowest posted speed limits. Emergency vehicles travelling at a high rate of speed even with emergency lights and sirens create a potentially dangerous situation and disruption to the residential character of the neighborhoods. Emergency vehicles should primarily use principal arterial roads in the city, which are Ridgewood Avenue, Beville Road and Nova Road. 
(5)  Noises caused by public utility system emergency operations of the city government, such as those associated with a lift or pump station. 
(6)  Operations for which building permits have been issued or operations not requiring permits due to ownership of the project by an agency of government, providing all equipment is operated as per the manufacturer's specifications and with all standard equipment, manufacturer's mufflers and noise-reducing equipment in use and in proper operating condition. Such operations shall be limited to the hours between 7:00 a.m. and the earlier of sunset or 7:00 p.m. on each day of the week throughout the year; however, other hours, based upon important need, maybe allowed by the city under special permit. 
(7)  All noise generated from the normal operations of aircraft (not including scale models). 
(8)  All noise generated by the normal operations of railroad trains. 
(9)  Noise generated by air conditioners when functioning in accord with the manufacturer's standard mufflers and noise reducing equipment in use and in proper operating condition according to the standards promulgated by the American Refrigeration Institute. 
(10)  Sound produced by outside sound-amplification devices used on residential property in connection with a private party or function. However, such sound shall not exceed the maximum applicable decibel level specified in section 10-32, shall not be produced for more than six (6) hours in a 24-hour period and shall not be produced after 10:00 p.m. or before 10:00 a.m. 
(11)  Sound produced by outside sound-amplification equipment used by governmental agencies for law enforcement or public safety purposes. 
(12)  All sound generated by normal vehicular traffic on streets within the city. 
(13)  Noises from work in a public right-of-way authorized by the city manager or state department of transportation. 
(14)  Outside amplification at special events approved by the city council in section 10-35. 
(Ord. No. 94-23, § 2, 1-10-95; Ord. No. 18-11 , § 1, 7-10-18)  
Sec. 10-35. - Outside amplification permit. 
(a)  Findings. 
(1)  The city council finds as follows: 
a.  Sound amplification devices, by their nature, are intended to increase sound, and they therefore generally increase the likelihood that sound will become unreasonable noise as defined in this article, or that sound will violate the noise level standards set forth in this article; 
b.  Sound amplification devices used to provide entertainment, are generally used and intended to attract persons to the site where such devices are used; 
c.  Within many areas of the city are located non-residential uses of property, such as restaurants and bars, that are within close proximity to residential areas, and the tendency of such commercial uses to utilize sound amplification devices to attract customers to their site, also increases the tendency of sounds emanating from such uses to disturb the peace and enjoyment of those persons occupying property in the adjacent residential areas; 
d.  The areas referred to in subsection c. above have historically been the subject of numerous noise complaints; and 
e.  The close proximity of such non-residential uses, particularly where they are concentrated, within close proximity to residential areas requires the use of permitting requirements to help ensure that the provisions of this article are not violated. 
(2)  The purpose of this section is to address the tendency of sound amplification devices within the areas described above to increase sound to impermissible levels that violate this article. 
(b)  Sound permits for use of amplified sound equipment. 
(1)  No outdoor amplified sound equipment may be located outdoors on any nonresidential property where such equipment is located within one thousand (1,000) feet of a residential area, unless the person owning or occupying the property has a valid, current sound permit. For purposes herein, sound equipment shall also be deemed to be "located outdoors" if: 
a.  Affixed or attached to the exterior of the structure; 
b.  Set in or near a window or other opening, such that the sound is directed away from the enclosed structure or toward any outside areas of the property on which the equipment is located; or 
c.  Located within an outdoor seating area. 
A sound permit is not required if the sound from the outside amplification source is not plainly audible at the real property boundary line. Sound permits are not required for city sponsored events and private functions [which are regulated by section 10-34(10)]. 
(2)  Sound permits shall be valid for a period of time identified in the permit, unless suspended pursuant to section 10-35(e). 
(c)  Application requirements and procedures. 
(1)  Application for sound permits shall be made to the community development department, and shall include all information necessary to assure compliance with this article, including:

b.  Clear and legible drawings with description showing the location and type of sound equipment that will be used, in relation to the property boundaries and any permanent structures located on the property. 
(2)  All permit applications shall be approved or denied within thirty (30) calendar days after submission. Any application not specifically denied within the 30-calendar day period shall be deemed granted. 
(3)  No sound permit shall be issued unless the information provided by the applicant indicates that the sound amplification equipment will be oriented toward the interior of the property, unless the information provided shows that sound barriers or other means of noise attenuation shall be placed so as to substantially reduce the amplified sound that would otherwise impact adjacent properties or adjacent street right-of-way. The sound permit shall include as an attachment or incorporate by reference, a plan or sketch indicating location and orientation of the sound equipment, as well as the type and location of sound barriers or other means of attenuation. 
(4)  The community development director shall notify an applicant in writing no later than ten (10) days of a decision to deny a sound permit. The written notice shall include a statement as to why the permit has been denied, and a statement that the permittee has the right to appeal denial in accordance with the procedure set forth herein. A person whose application for sound permit is denied may appeal the decision as provided in herein. If no appeal is timely filed in accordance with procedure set forth herein, the denial shall be deemed to be final administrative action. 
(d)  Conditions of compliance. 
(1)  A permittee shall comply with each of the following conditions: 
a.  The permittee shall not use, or suffer or permit the sound amplification equipment to be used, to produce noise that is prohibited by section 10-33 of this Code. 
b.  The permittee shall, upon request by a city police or code enforcement officer, turn the amplification equipment off to allow the officer to obtain sound readings for purposes of measuring compliance with the noise level standards set forth in section 10-32. 
c.  The permittee shall operate the sound equipment permitted hereunder, solely from 11:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m., except when the city council establishes alternate permissible hours for declared special events. 
d.  The sound equipment, and any sound barriers or other attenuation barriers included in the permit, shall at all times be located and oriented in accordance with subsection 10-35(c)(3) of this Code; and 
e.  The sound equipment and any sound barriers or other attenuation devices approved as part of the permit, shall comply with any applicable requirements of the Florida Building Code, including any local amendments which the city may adopt from time to time. 
(2)  Upon the determination that an amplified sound in excess of the sound level permitted herein, the sound shall be reduced by the city staff to a compliant sound level if the property owner or tenant fails to reduce the sound. 
(e)  Suspension of sound permits. 
(1)  The permits and licensing director shall be authorized to suspend a sound permit issued hereunder: 
a.  For up to thirty (30) days whenever the permittee has failed to comply with a condition of compliance as set forth in section 10-35(d); 
b.  For up to sixty (60) days whenever the permittee refuses to comply with subsection 10-35(d)(1)b.; and 
c.  For up to ninety (90) days, whenever a court of law or the special magistrate has adjudicated the permittee to be in violation of subsection 10-35(d)(1)a. 
(2)  In determining whether to suspend a sound permit and the duration of suspension, the community development director shall consider the harm to public safety and the negative effects on the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties, the intent of the permit holder, the extent, duration and repetition of the violation, previous violations, any previous warnings or advisements, and the breadth of the record of information. 
(3)  Whenever the community development director suspends a sound permit in accordance with subsection (1) or (2) above, the administrator shall notify the permittee in writing at the address indicated on the permit application. The written notice shall contain a summary of the violation and a statement that the permittee has the right to appeal in accordance with section 10-35(f) of this Code. If no appeal is timely filed in accordance with section 10-35(f), the denial shall be deemed to be a final administrative action. 
(f)  Appeals (council decision—no appeal). 
(1)  Appeals of any determination to deny a permit application or suspend a permit under this division may be made as follows: 
a.  The person whose permit application has been denied or whose permit was suspended shall within ten (10) days of receipt of the written notice of denial of a permit application or suspension, file with the city manager's office a written request for a hearing before the city manager. 
b.  The hearing before the city manager shall to be held within five (5) working days of the receipt of the appeal. Written notice of the hearing shall be provided to the appellant no less than twenty-four (24) hours before the appeal, at the address provided by the written request for hearing. During the hearing, the appellant may present evidence and may be represented by legal counsel, but formal rules of evidence shall not apply. Within two (2) working days of the end of the hearing, the city manager shall affirm, modify or reverse the decision, utilizing the applicable criteria set forth in this Code for issuance of sound permit or suspension of sound permit, as the case may be. 
c.  Whenever an appeal has been made to a suspension of permit, the filing of the timely filing of the appeal shall stay the suspension until the city manager has made the decision regarding the appeal. If the city manager modifies a suspension, the city manager may not impose a suspension greater than the period of suspension under appeal. The decision of the city manager shall be deemed the city's final administrative action. 
d.  The status or disposition of a criminal prosecution of the permit holder for a violation of this article arising out of the same facts or incident giving rise to the denial or suspension of a permit, shall not effect or be a bar to the administrative proceedings provided in this section. 
(Ord. No. 18-11 , § 1, 7-10-18)  
Sec. 10-36. - Enforcement. 
Violations of this article shall be enforced by the Code enforcement division of the community development department or the police department. Violations of this article shall be prosecuted through the special magistrate and any other legal means of enforcement. 
If a noise complaint is filed with the city, the enforcement official shall promptly visit both the location of the complainant and the source of the sound to determine the validity of the complaint. 
If the complaint is determined to be legitimate, the enforcement official shall direct that the sound volume be promptly lowered to a level that complies with the these regulations or if the violation is for outside amplification without an outside amplification permit, then all amplification sources must be turned off; this notification shall be considered a "first warning". One (1) such warning will be tolerated per 24-hour period—if a second notification is required, it shall be in the form of a notice to "shut down" ("stop the music") for the remainder of the day. 
Five (5) "warning notices" or three (3) "shut-downs" during either a 12-month period, may result in the city denial of an outside amplification sound permit or special event permit for up to a 12-month period from the date of the final warning notice of "shut-down", which will be applicable to both the location and the sponsor. To avoid being prohibited for twelve (12) months to obtain an outside amplification permit or special event permit, the property owner or tenant or sponsor shall be required to prove to the city that changes and modification to the operations have been made to address the noise violation(s). 
The operation or maintenance of any device, instrument, vehicle or machinery which violates the provisions of this article and that endangers the comfort, repose, health and peace of the residents in the affected area is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, and the city is authorized to pursue any and all remedies therefor. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit any private right of action.

(a)  Malfunctions of alarm systems are causing substantial misuse of the manpower and resources of the police department of the city by provoking responses to numerous false alarms.

(c)  Such false alarms and use of such telephone alarm devices create a threat or potential threat to the health, safety and welfare of the people of the city. 
(Code 1966, § 18-61; Ord. No. 86-1, § 1, 1-28-86)

(Code 1966, § 18-63; Ord. No. 86-1, § 1, 1-28-86)  
Sec. 13-41. - Report of corrective action required.

Furthermore, should any false alarm fees remain unpaid, the city manager is directed to withhold issuance of the city local business tax receipt until such time as all false alarm fees are paid.

Sec. 13-43. - Authority to disconnect. 
In addition to disconnecting for failure to pay the fee as provided above, upon a determination by the chief of police that any false alarm other than a false alarm to which a first response is made has resulted from a failure on the part of the owner or manager of the premises to take necessary corrective action, the chief of police shall be authorized to disconnect the system. It shall be unlawful to reconnect such alarm system unless and until appropriate corrective action has been taken and such reconnection is authorized by the chief of police; provided, however, that no disconnection or deactivation shall be ordered or made to any premises required by law to have an alarm system in operation.

Sec. 13-70. - Legislative findings and intent. 
(a)  The findings set forth in the recitals ("whereas" clauses) of the ordinance from which this article is derived are hereby adopted as additional legislative findings. 
(b)  The city council of the City of South Daytona hereby adopts the provisions of F.S. § 775.21(3)(a), which states as follows: 
"Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offences, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
The high level of threat that a sexual predator presents to the public safety, and the long-term effects suffered by victims of sex offenses, provide the state with sufficient justification to implement a strategy..." 
(c)  The city council of the City of South Daytona hereby adopts the provisions of F.S. § 947.1405(8), which provides, in pertinent part: 
"It is the finding of the Legislature that the population of offenders released from state prison into the community who meet the conditional release criteria poses the greatest threat to the public safety of the groups of offenders under community supervision." 
(d)  The city council of the City of South Daytona hereby finds and determines that repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant and a drain on the resources of society. 
(e)  It is the intent of this article to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residences. 
(f)  It is the desire of the city council of the City of South Daytona that the Volusia County School district carefully adhere to the provisions of F.S. § 947.1405(7).

Sec. 14-36. - Responsibilities of abutting property owners for maintenance of parkages; prohibitions. 
(a)  It shall be the duty and responsibility of every owner of real property within the city to at all times maintain those areas of parkage abutting their property. These duties and responsibilities shall include cutting and mowing grass and weeds, edging of sidewalks and curbs, maintaining irrigation systems installed by adjoining property owners and cutting and trimming flowers, vines, shrubbery, and trees so as to keep the sidewalk and roadway safe and clear from obstruction and maintain a neat, trim appearance in such areas, and to keep the parkage area free from debris, refuse, landscape material, rock or other material that could be an obstruction to the road or sidewalk or otherwise constitute a safety concern. More specifically, grass shall be mowed to within three (3) inches of the ground at least once a month during the months of May through October and at least once every two (2) months during the remaining period of the year. Weeds shall be removed at least once every two (2) months.

(c)  No person shall plant or remove any tree or shrubbery from any parkage unless written permission is requested in writing and received in writing from the city manager or his designee. When evaluating a request, the primary concern of the city shall be the safety of pedestrians, vehicles, public improvements and utilities. The city's considerations shall include the location of the proposed tree; proximity to paved road, intersection and street signs; proximity to sidewalk; potential for future damage or obstruction to utilities, roadways, curbs and streets; and how long the tree, shrub or vine has been in that location. In the event the city denies a request to remove a specimen tree, the city shall assume sole responsibility to trim said tree.

The notice shall specify the violations and indicate what the property owner must do to comply with this article. The notice shall give the property owner fifteen (15) days from his receipt of the notice to comply with this article.

A lien shall be imposed on abutting property for the costs of bringing parkage into compliance with this article and administrative costs associated with enforcement.

Further, the city may place additional or revised permit conditions following a substantial breach. In addition, the city may refuse to issue new permits to a permittee or permittee's contractor that has materially violated any provisions of a permit or applicable codes, including but not limited to this article, until such time as the owner cures the violation to the satisfaction of the city, including paving any damages, costs or penalties that may have been assessed. 
(d)  Within thirty (30) days of receiving notification of the breach, the permittee shall contact the city and provide a plan, acceptable to the city. The city shall provide additional time as reasonably necessary for a permittee to establish an acceptable plan taking into account the nature and scope of the alleged breach.

(Ord. No. 18-16 , § 2, 11-13-18)  
Sec. 14-76. - Forced relocation. 
(a)  Any facility heretofore or hereafter placed upon, under, over, or along any public rights-of-way that is found by the city to be unreasonably interfering in any way with the convenient, safe or continuous use or the maintenance, improvement, extension or expansion of such public rights-of-way shall, upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the owner or its agent, be removed or relocated by such owner at its own expense except as explicitly provided under F.S. § 337.403. The city may waive or extend the time within which an owner shall remove or relocate a facility for good cause shown. 
(b)  The owner shall remove all conduits, cables, poles, lines, and other system facilities which the owner installed or placed or had installed or placed without first having obtained the permits required in this article or applicable law, within thirty (30) days after the city provides the owner written notice ordering the owner to remove the same. If the owner fails to comply with the written notice, the city may remove or have removed the facilities by order of the city manager. In such instance the cost of removal, including twenty-five (25) percent of the actual removal costs for administrative expenses, shall be borne and paid by the owner upon demand. Such costs shall be collectible by the city in any lawful manner, together with attorneys' fees and costs of collection. 
(c)  Removal or relocation at the direction of the city of an owner's lawfully placed or maintained facility in public rights-of-way shall be governed by the provisions of F.S. §§ 337.403 and 337.404, as they may be amended. Subject to F.S. § 337.403, whenever an order of the city requires such removal or change in the location of any facility from the public rights-of-way, and the facility owner fails to remove or charge the same at its own expense to conform to the order within the time stated in the notice, the city may proceed to cause the facility to be removed. The expense thereby incurred except as provided in F.S. § 337.403(1)(a)—(c), shall be paid out of any money available therefor, and such expense shall be charged against the owner of the facility and levied, collected and paid to the city. 
(d)  Subject to F.S. § 337.403, whenever it shall be necessary for the city to remove or relocate any facility, the owner of the facility shall be given notice of such removal or relocation and an order requiring the payment of the costs thereof, and shall be given reasonable time, which shall not be less than twenty (20) nor more than thirty (30) days in which to appear before the city council to contest the reasonableness of the order. Should the owner not appear, the determination of the cost to the owner shall be final, in accordance with F.S. § 337.404. 
(e)  A final order of the city shall constitute a lien on any property of the owner and may be enforced by filing an authenticated copy of the order in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county wherein the owner's property is located and/or by drawing upon the owner's performance construction bond. All costs and expenses referenced in this article, that are the responsibility of the owner, shall not be deducted from or credited against any other fees or taxes that the owner may be required to pay to the city pursuant to this article. 
(f)  The city retains the right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the public rights-of-way of the city, as the city may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the city shall attempt to notify the owner of the facility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the owner of the facility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility. The owner shall be responsible for costs and expenses incurred for such emergency repairs and construction. 
(g)  The city shall have the right to make such inspections of facilities placed or maintained in public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this article. The city shall have access without charge to any manholes or hand-holes at any time, of a utility service provider in which the city has facilities, provided the city has given such provider reasonable prior notice so that such provider can have trained personnel present when the city accesses such manholes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city, in the proper exercise of its municipal police powers and duties with respect to the public rights-of-way, shall have access to all manholes and hand-holes without charge of such provider. In the event the city determines that a violation exists with respect to owner's placement or maintenance of facilities in the public rights-of-way that is not considered to be an emergency or danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the city will provide the owner no less than three (3) days' written notice setting forth the violation and requesting correction. 
(h)  Following the completion of construction to place a new or replace an existing facility in the public rights-of-way, the owner shall promptly provide revised plans and "as-builts" including, but not limited to, horizontal and vertical profiles, within sixty (60) days after completion of any installation or construction. The plans shall be in a digitized format, showing the two-dimensional location of the facilities, based on the city's geographical database or other format acceptable to the city. The owner shall provide such plans at no cost to the city. The city shall maintain the confidentiality of such plans and any other information provided in accordance with F.S. § 202.195, as it may be amended. 
(i)  To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, an owner shall allow city facilities to be collocated within city's public rights-of-way through the use of a joint trench during owner's construction project. Such joint trench projects shall be negotiated in good faith by separate agreement between the owner and city and may be subjected to other city rights-of-way requirements. The city further reserves without limitation the right to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the city and within said limits as same may from time to time be altered.

(3)  To regulate the placement and maintenance of structures and facilities in the public rights-of-way pursuant to F.S. § 337.401; and 
(4)  To adopt and to administer reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with state and federal law, including the United States and Florida Constitutions, F.S. § 337.401, as it may be amended, the city's home-rule authority, and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Spectrum Act, FCC regulations, and other federal and state law; to establish reasonable rules and regulations necessary to manage the placement and maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way by all communications services providers after the effective date of this section; and to minimize disruption to the public rights-of-way. 
(5)  Applicability. 
a.  Persons seeking to place or maintain communications facilities on private property or other property to which the city, any municipality, Volusia County, Volusia County School Board, State of Florida, or federal government has a fee simple or leasehold interest in real property, not within and exclusive of the public rights-of-way, located within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city shall comply with the applicable provisions of the City Consolidated Land Development Regulations, Article V, Section 5.9, Telecommunications Antennas and Towers, to the extent it applies, unless such property is addressed expressly in this article. This article is not applicable to communication facilities outside the public rights-of-way. Pursuant to this article, a person may be authorized to place or to maintain small wireless facilities, micro wireless facilities, or utility poles for collocation of small wireless facilities in the city public rights-of-way. Wireless support structures, telecommunications towers and other wireless facilities, including but not limited to an antenna that is not part of a small wireless facility or micro wireless facility, shall not be allowed to be placed or maintained in the public rights-of-way, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law. This article applies to the placement of conduit, fiber or cable for the purpose of providing backhaul or communications service: Consistent with F.S. § 337.401, this article applies to a cable or video service provider that has been issued and holds, a certificate of franchise authority from the Florida Department of State pursuant to F.S. ch. 610, that places or maintains a cable system or wireline facilities in the city's public rights-of-way. This article shall not apply to wireless or communications facilities owned by the city, and shall not apply to communications or wireless facilities owned by a person, including an electric cooperative, to the extent such facilities are utilized on an internal, non-commercial basis by said person. 
b.  This article implements inter alia, the Advanced Wireless Infrastructure Deployment Act, F.S. § 337.401(7) ("Wireless Act"). By adopting this article, the city does not waive any rights with respect to the Wireless Act including any rights that may exist under federal law, the Florida Constitution and the U.S. Constitution. In the event the Wireless Act, F.S. § 337.401(7), is repealed, amended, or overturned by a court of competent jurisdiction, or preempted by applicable federal law or regulation, in whole or in part, provisions of this article may no longer apply, in which case pending and future applications for small wireless facilities or utility poles intended to support the collocation of small wireless facilities in the public rights-of-way, will be governed by applicable law. In addition, permits issued pursuant to this article may be suspended or revoked, and facilities installed pursuant to this article or the Wireless Act may be required to be removed at the facility owner's expense, to the extent consistent with applicable law. It is the city's intent not to create any vested rights in placing and maintaining facilities addressed in the Wireless Act in the public rights-of-way as a result of this article or any permit issued pursuant to this article, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law. 
c.  To the extent any provision of this article conflicts with this Code or the Consolidated Land Development Regulations of the city, this article shall control. 
d.  This article shall be applicable to all communications facilities placed in the public rights-of-way on or after the effective date of this article, all pending applications for permits subject to this article, and shall apply to all existing communications facilities placed in the public rights-of-way prior to the effective date of this article, to the full extent permitted by state and federal law. A person with existing communications facilities in the public rights-of-way shall comply with this article by the earlier of the following: ninety (90) days from the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived or prior to the issuance of a permit pursuant to this article. This provision shall not require removal or modification of communications facilities placed or maintained in the public rights-of-way pursuant to a previously issued permit prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived unless such facilities are abandoned or otherwise required to be altered or removed. 
e.  Reservation of rights. The city reserves the right to amend this article as it shall find necessary in the lawful exercise of its police powers. 
(6)  Authority to implement article. The city manager is authorized to adopt, to modify, and to repeal rules and regulations to carry out the intent and purposes of this article.

Said coverage shall not exclude contractual liability, products/completed operations, independent or contractors.

(4)  This article shall not be construed to affect in any way the city's rights, privileges and immunities as set forth in F.S. § 768.28. Insurance under this division shall run continuously with the presence of the registrant's facilities in the public rights-of-way, and any termination or lapse of such insurance shall be a violation of this article. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may, in its sole discretion, require increased or decreased levels of insurance.

In the event a registrant fails to perform its duties and obligations imposed upon the registrant by the provisions of this article, subject to provisions for notice in this article, there shall be recoverable from the permanent performance bond, any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the registrant, plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees.

If no information in the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits. 
(5)  Indemnification. A registrant shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold harmless and defend the city, its officials, boards, members, agents and employees, against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, judgments for damages or equitable relief, and costs and expenses incurred by the city arising out of the placement or maintenance of its communications system or facilities in public rights-of-way, regardless of whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by this article. This provision includes, but is not limited to, the city's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit or proceedings.

(a)  In accordance with applicable law, city ordinances, codes and regulations, including this article, a right-of-way use permit issued by the city shall be required for any person to place or to maintain a communications facility in the public rights-of-way unless otherwise exempt pursuant to this article. An effective registration shall be a condition of obtaining a permit. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant if all permitting requirements are met. The city may grant to any person who is a resident of Florida, or to any corporation which is organized under the laws of Florida or licensed to do business within Florida, the use of a right-of-way for the communications facility in accordance with such rules or regulations as the city may adopt. No communications facility shall be installed, located, or relocated unless authorized by a written permit issued by the city. Permits shall apply only to the areas of public rights-of-way specifically identified in the permit.

Registrant shall provide prompt notice to the city of the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the event of an emergency and, within ten (10) days of completing the emergency maintenance, apply for a permit if such activity required a permit. 
(2)  A registrant shall be allowed to perform routine maintenance within the public rights-of-way if such proposed routine maintenance does not involve excavation, construction, or disruption of transportation in the public rights-of-way. In the case of routine maintenance, a registrant shall provide reasonable advance written notice to the city identifying the areas where such maintenance will occur, scope of maintenance, date(s) and duration of work to be performed. If routine maintenance requires the closure of the public rights-of-way, a permit shall be required. 
(3)  A permit shall not be required for replacement of existing wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are substantially similar or of the same or smaller size. Any maintenance or replacement that involves a city utility pole or city utility shall not be performed without providing reasonable prior notice to the city. 
(4)  A registrant shall be allowed to place or to maintain a service drop within the public rights-of-way without first obtaining a permit if such proposed work does not involve excavation, construction, or the temporary closure of the public rights-of-way.

Prior to placing a micro wireless facility in the public rights-of-way pursuant to this subsection, at least thirty (30) days prior to commencing said work, the registrant shall submit a certification or manufacturer's specifications with the micro wireless facility's dimensions to the city to review for compliance with the dimension requirements of F.S. § 337.401(7), and this article. A registrant's submission to demonstrate a micro wireless facility's dimensions may apply to all identical micro wireless facilities sought to be placed in the public rights-of-way by such registrant, and the registrant is not required to submit a new certification or manufacturer's specifications unless the registrant seeks to place a micro wireless facility by a different manufacturer or with different dimensions in the public rights-of-way. If the micro wireless facility's dimensions exceed the dimensions to constitute a micro wireless facility, the registrant shall not be authorized to place such facility in the public rights-of-way. 
(c)  The city manager may cause an immediate stop work order where any permitted or unpermitted construction or other work in the public rights-of-way poses a serious threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public until such serious threat has been abated. Failure to comply with such order may subject a registrant, and its agents, employees, and contractors as applicable, to appropriate enforcement remedies as set forth in this article and applicable law.

3.  If an agreement is not reached, the applicant must notify the city of such nonagreement and the city must grant or deny the original application within ninety (90) days after the date the application was filed unless extended by mutual consent of the applicant and city. Failure of the applicant to so notify the city as required herein shall be deemed to constitute the applicant's rejection of the city's alternative location. A request for an alternative location, an acceptance of an alternative location, or a rejection of an alternative location must be in writing and provided by electronic mail. 
c.  The city processes all applications on a nondiscriminatory basis. Unless the city and the applicant engage in negotiations as provided above, the city will approve or deny the application and will notify the applicant by electronic mail whether the application is approved or denied within sixty (60) days after the receipt of a completed application. 
d.  Extension of time. If the city and the applicant do not engage in negotiations, the applicant and city may mutually agree to extend the sixty-day application review period. The city shall grant or deny the application at the end of the extended period. 
e.  The city may deny a proposed collocation of a small wireless facility in the public rights-of-way if the proposed collocation: 
1.  Materially interferes with the safe operation of traffic control equipment; 
2.  Materially interferes with sight lines or clear zones for transportation, pedestrians, or public safety purposes; 
3.  Materially interferes with compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar federal or state standards regarding pedestrian access or movement; 
4.  Materially fails to comply with the 2010 edition of the Florida Department of Transportation Utility Accommodation Manual; or 
5.  Fails to comply with applicable codes. 
f.  Cure procedure. 
1.  If the application is denied, the city will specify the basis for the denial, including the specific code provisions on which the denial was based, on the day the city denies the application. 
2.  The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the city and resubmit the application within thirty (30) days after the notice of denial is sent. 
3.  If an attempt to cure is made by the applicant, the city will approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30) days after receipt of the revised application. If the applicant revises any information in the application other than to address expressly the deficiencies identified by the city, the applicant shall submit a new application. 
4.  The city's second and subsequent reviews of revised applications will be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial notice. 
g.  A permit issued pursuant to an approved application shall remain in effect for one (1) year unless otherwise extended, suspended, or revoked by the city pursuant to this article. If a small wireless facility or utility pole is installed without a permit pursuant to applicable state or federal law, the applicant shall nevertheless be required to have an effective registration, comply with development standards and provide the performance bond required in this article prior to performing construction. 
h.  A permit from the city constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities in the public rights-of-way in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. 
(2)  Review procedures for applications for all communications facilities other than small cell facilities and utility poles for collocation of small wireless facilities. 
The city shall review and process applications for communications facilities other than small wireless facilities and utility poles for collocation of small wireless facilities consistent with applicable law and city procedures.

A material breach by the permittee may include, but is not limited to: 
1.  The violation of any material provision of the permit or applicable codes; 
2.  An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the permit or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city; 
3.  Any material misrepresentation of fact in the process of permittee's request for a permit or registration; 
4.  The failure to maintain the required permanent performance bond, construction bond or insurance; 
5.  The failure to properly restore the public rights-of-way; 
6.  The failure to comply within the specified time with an order issued by the city; 
7.  The failure to register, renew a registration, or provide notice of transfer in accordance with this article; 
8.  The failure to relocate or remove facilities pursuant to this article and F.S. §§ 337.402, 337.403 and 337.404, as amended; 
9.  Conducting work in the public rights-of-way without a permit, if required. 
b.  If the city determines that a registrant has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of the permit or violation of applicable codes including but not limited to this article, the city shall make a written demand upon the registrant to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that the continued violation(s) may be cause for suspension or revocation of the permit, in addition to any other remedy available to the city. Further, the city may place additional or revised permit conditions following a substantial breach. In addition, the city may refuse to issue new permits to a registrant or registrant's contractor that has materially violated any provisions of a permit or applicable codes including but not limited to this article, until such time as the registrant cures the violation to the satisfaction of the city, including paying any damages, costs or penalties that may have been assessed. 
c.  Within thirty (30) days of receiving notification of the breach, the permittee shall contact the city and provide a plan, acceptable to the city. The city shall provide additional time as reasonably necessary for a permittee to establish an acceptable plan taking into account the nature and scope of the alleged breach. The permittee's failure to so contact the city, the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or the permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for revocation or suspension of the permit. A final determination to suspend or to revoke a permit may be appealed in accordance with the procedures set forth in this article. Nothing herein shall affect the city's ability to take immediate action or to cause a registrant to take immediate action pursuant to this article or applicable law to address any condition that threatens the health, safety or welfare of persons or property. 
d.  If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including restoration costs, administrative costs, and the cost of collection. These cost may also be deducted from the registrant's fund in the city's discretion. 
e.  The city may cause an immediate stop work order where the construction poses a serious threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public until such time as such serious threat has been abated. 
f.  In the event of an emergency, if a registrant fails to do so in a timely manner, the city may perform any work involving a communications facility in the public rights-of-way to prevent a threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public and charge all costs including collection costs to the registrant. Nothing herein shall operate as a waiver of the city's police powers. 
(4)  Requests for waivers. 
a.  Nothing in this article shall be construed to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral use of public rights-of-way by communications service providers, communications facility providers or pass-through providers, in violation of federal or state law. 
b.  The city may grant a waiver in those circumstances where a competitively neutral use of the public rights-of-way is impaired by strict application of the requirements of this article.

Sec. 14-107. - Performance construction bond. 
(a)  Prior to the issuance of any permit in accordance with this article, or performing any work in the public rights-of-way, either pursuant to a permit or without a permit if authorized by applicable law except in the case of an emergency pursuant to this article, a registrant shall establish in the city's favor a performance construction bond to secure the restoration of the public rights-of-way, and to ensure the registrant's faithful performance of the construction or other work in the public rights-of-way, in accordance with applicable sections of the city Code. The performance construction bond must name the city as obligee and be conditioned upon the full and faithful compliance by the registrant with all requirements, duties, and obligations imposed by the permit and provisions of this article during and through completion of the placement or maintenance project. The performance construction bond shall be in an amount as determined by the city based on one hundred ten (110) percent of the estimated costs of the restoration of the public rights-of-way. No performance construction bond is required if the estimated costs of the restoration of the public rights-of-way is less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) provided the registrant has a fully replenished performance cash bond on file with the city. For a consolidated permit, the registrant shall provide a performance construction bond based on one hundred ten (110) percent of the amount of the total costs of the restoration of the public rights-of-way for all small wireless facilities to be collocated on utility poles within the public rights-of-way, but in no event shall be less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00). The minimum amount of the performance construction bond for a new or replaced utility pole or ground mounted small wireless facility up to twenty-eight (28) cubic feet shall be twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00). The bond shall be issued by a surety licensed to operate in Florida having a minimum rating of A-1 in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition; shall be subject to the approval of the city attorney and may be administratively accepted by the city manager. 
(b)  In the event a registrant subject to such a performance construction bond fails to complete the work in a safe, timely and competent manner in accordance with the provisions of the permit or city Code, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the registrant, or the cost of completing the work, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney's fees, up to the full amount of the bond. The performance construction bond must be issued as non-cancelable and shall provide the following: "This bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until 60 days after receipt by the City, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew." 
(c)  The performance construction bond shall be for a term of not less than one (1) year after the anticipated date of the later of completion of construction, restoration and city inspection. In the event the term of any performance construction bond expires, or is reasonably expected to expire, prior to one-year after the completion of construction, restoration and city inspection, the registrant shall immediately obtain, pay for, and file with the city a replacement performance construction bond. No less than one (1) year after completion of the construction and satisfaction of all obligations in accordance with the bond, the registrant may request that the city remove the requirement to continue the performance construction bond. Notwithstanding, the city may require a new bond for any subsequent work performed in the public rights-of-way. 
(d)  The rights reserved by the city with respect to any performance construction bond established pursuant to this article are in addition to all other rights and remedies the city may have under this article, or at law or equity, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to the performance construction bond will affect any other right the city may have.

Registrant shall use and exercise due caution, care and skill in performing work in the public rights-of-way, and shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard work site areas. 
(b)  Prior to the installation, placement, maintenance or removal of any conduits, cables or pole lines, or the start of any other type of construction in the public the rights-of-way, the registrant shall, pursuant to existing or subsequently enacted city ordinances, notify the city's chief building official and public works director at least sixty (60) days in advance of its proposed activity. Such notification shall include the place, date and time where the conduits, cables or pole lines, or other form of construction, are to be installed or removed or where the construction is to be conducted. The registrant will not assert the existence of any vested rights as a result of the city's review. Further, such review by the city shall not be construed by the registrant as a warranty that the placement by the registrant of its conduits, cables or pole lines, or the start of construction, is in compliance with any applicable rules, regulations or laws. 
(c)  In connection with excavation in the public rights-of-way, a registrant shall, where applicable, comply with the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act set forth in F.S. ch. 556, as it may be amended. In the event of any conflicts with existing utilities or utility service laterals, the proposed location of the communications facility will be adjusted, not the utility. 
(d)  To the extent not inconsistent with applicable codes, underground cables shall have consistent alignment parallel with the edge of pavement, at a minimum a thirty-six-inch depth of cover for the unpaved or paved portion of roadways, and shall have a three-foot horizontal clearance from other underground utilities and their appurtenances so as to not impede the maintenance or replacement of said utilities. The lowest wire on any poles or micro wireless facility placed in any public right-of-way used by vehicle traffic shall not be less than eighteen (18) feet from the ground and whenever telephone and electric power wires cross each other, wires shall cross and be maintained in accordance with the National Electrical Code, the National Electrical Safety Code and the "Safety Rules for the Installation and Maintenance of Electrical Supply and Communication Lines" established by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Standards of the United States in force at the time of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives and as amended. 
(e)  Grounding rods and pull boxes. The grounding rod may not extend above the top of the public right-of-way or sidewalk and must be placed in a pull-box, and the ground wire between the pole and ground rod must be inside an underground conduit. All pull boxes shall be vehicle load bearing, comply with applicable codes and FDOT Standard specification and be listed on the FDOT Approved Products List. A concrete pad shall be installed around all pull boxes not located in the sidewalk. No new or replacement pull boxes shall be located in pedestrian ramps. 
(f)  In the event the registrant's work requires the obstruction of city-owned, metered parking spaces, the registrant shall pay a reasonable fee to the city as prescribed in any existing or subsequently enacted city ordinance, or policy adopted thereto based on the revenues lost by the city due to registrant's obstruction of metered parking spaces. 
(g)  In the event that work to be conducted by the registrant requires streets or traffic lanes to be closed or obstructed, the registrant shall, pursuant to the requirements of the city, obtain all permits from, and pay all fees therefor to, and obtain approval of its maintenance-of-traffic plan from the city. In no event shall such obstruction be greater than twenty-four (24) hours, unless approved expressly by the city. 
(h)  The general policy of the city is to require underground installation of electric, cable and fiber lines to the greatest extent feasible, to assure public safety, foster tree preservation and protect the general aesthetic character of the city. To the maximum extent practicable, all facilities shall be constructed underground utilizing "trenchless" (i.e., directional bore or jack and bore method) technology. The registrant may construct above ground facilities where similar facilities of all other communications service providers are above ground, but shall be required to construct such facilities underground where similar facilities of another communications service provider are underground. Poles, underground cables, or other facilities of the system shall be placed between the property line and the curb line of all roads, streets and avenues and no above ground facilities shall be within the roadway recovery area. Underground missile boring shall be prohibited unless waived by the city. The registrant shall be solely liable for the displacement, damage or destruction of any property, public rights-of-way, irrigation system, utility, or landscaping as a result of the placement or maintenance of its facility within the public rights-of-way. The city may issue such rules and regulations concerning the method for placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way as may be consistent with this article and other applicable codes and standards. The provisions of this subsection are not intended to prevent the use of any method of construction not specifically prescribed by this subsection, provided that any such method has been approved by the city. 
(i)  In an effort to minimize adverse impacts and disruption in the public rights-of-way and to other municipal improvements, the city may require a communications services provider to coordinate the placement or maintenance of its facilities with any work, construction, installation in or repairs of the subject public rights-of-way or other facilities therein, that is occurring or is scheduled to occur within a reasonable time from the date(s) requested in the communications services provider's permit application. The city may require a registrant to alter reasonably its placement or maintenance schedule as necessary to minimize disruptions and disturbance in the public rights-of-way. The city may provide a more definite time frame based on specific city construction or maintenance schedules. Within the public rights-of-way, every communications services provider shall make space available in its trench and/or conduit to other communications services providers consistent with the federal requirements of 47 U.S.C. § 224. Every communications services provider shall utilize existing conduits, pathways and other facilities whenever possible, and shall not place or maintain any new, different, or additional poles, conduits, pathways or other facilities, whether in the public rights-of-way or on privately-owned property, until written approval is obtained from the city or other appropriate governmental authority, and, where applicable, from the private property owner. 
(j)  Limits on excavation in restored rights-of-way. To avoid continual disruption and degradation to the public rights-of-way, an area of the public rights-of-way that has been subject to excavation that has been restored shall not be subject to re-excavation until at least two (2) years following the completion of such restoration, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, unless waived by the city. Registrants seeking to place communications facilities in the public rights-of-way through excavation are strongly encouraged to contact other registrants and communications services providers to coordinate the placement of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(k)  Trees. A registrant shall not prune, remove or materially damage trees during placement or maintenance of small wireless facilities, micro wireless facility, or utility poles in the public rights-of-way unless approved by the city. Tree removal or pruning is not permitted within the public rights-of-way to increase signal strength or to provide a line-of-sight for wireless facilities. Landscaping may only be damaged or removed during placement or maintenance of communications facilities pursuant to a permit issued by the city. The city may require that any landscaping or trees so removed shall be replaced or mitigated in accordance with the approved restoration plan. Any such trimming or removal shall be at registrant's sole expense, and registrant shall remove all trimmings from city's right-of-way and shall not leave trimmings or debris on any public or private property. 
(l)  The registrant shall not in any way displace, damage or destroy any facilities belonging to the city, or to any third party who placed such facilities therein by express authority of the city, without the consent of the city, and the registrant shall be liable to the city or to the third party owner, as the case may be, for the cost of any repairs made necessary by any such displacement, damage or destruction, and shall pay such costs upon demand. If owed to the city, such costs shall be collectible by the city in any lawful manner, together with attorneys' fees and costs of collection. 
(m)  Restoration of public rights-of-way. A registrant shall, at its own expense, restore the public rights-of-way to at least its original condition before such work in public rights-of-way was initiated, subject to the city's satisfaction upon inspection. This obligation shall include, but not be limited to, repair, or replacement, if necessary, of landscaping, in like size and of like kind, and irrigation systems serving such landscaping, located in public rights-of-way, as well as repair of bikepaths, driveway aprons, sign fixtures and sidewalks. Registrant shall warrant its restoration for a period of twelve (12) months after completion of such restoration. If the registrant fails to make such restoration within thirty (30) calendar days after completion of construction, or such other time as may be required by the city in the permit, the city may, after written notice to the registrant, perform such restoration using city employees, agents or contractors, and charge all costs of the restoration, plus an addition twenty-five (25) percent of the actual removal costs for administrative expenses, to the registrant in accordance with F.S. § 337.402, as it may be amended, and require reimbursement within thirty (30) days after the submission of the invoice by the city to the registrant. 
(n)  The city reserves the right to place and maintain, and permit to be placed or maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and other facilities, fiber, cables or conduit, and to do, and to permit to be done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may be deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way occupied by the registrant. The registrant shall not in any way displace, damage or destroy any sewer, water main, pipe or any other facilities belonging to the city, or to any third party who placed such facilities therein by express authority of the city, without the consent of the city, and the registrant shall be liable to the city or to the third party owner, as the case may be, for the cost of any repairs made necessary by any such displacement, damage or destruction and shall pay such costs upon demand. A registrant shall immediately notify the city of any damage to city utilities, city fiber or other city facilities as a result of a registrant's construction in the public rights-of-way. The registrant shall repair such damage at its expense within the time frame required by the city given the nature of the damage and impact on city services. In its discretion, the city may repair or arrange for the repair of such damage and charge such expense to the registrant. 
(o)  Any communications facilities heretofore or hereafter placed upon, under, over, or along any public rights-of-way that is found by the city to be unreasonably interfering in any way with the convenient, safe or continuous use or the maintenance, improvement, extension or expansion of such public rights-of-way shall, upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the registrant or its agent, be removed or relocated by such registrant at its own expense except as explicitly provided under F.S. § 337.403. The city may waive or extend the time within which a registrant shall remove or relocate a communications facility for good cause shown. 
(p)  The registrant shall remove all conduits, cables, poles, lines, and other system facilities which the registrant installed or placed or had installed or placed without first having obtained the permits required in this article or applicable law, within thirty (30) days after the city provides the registrant written notice ordering the registrant to remove the same. If the registrant fails to comply with the written notice, the city may remove or have removed the conduits, cables, poles and lines by order of the city manager. In such instance the cost of removal, including twenty-five (25) percent of the actual removal costs for administrative expenses, shall be borne and paid by the registrant upon demand. Such costs shall be collectible by the city in any lawful manner, together with attorneys' fees and costs of collection. 
(q)  Removal or relocation at the direction of the city of a registrant's lawfully placed or maintained communications facility in public rights-of-way shall be governed by the provisions of F.S. §§ 337.403 and 337.404, as they may be amended. Subject to F.S. § 337.403, whenever an order of the city requires such removal or change in the location of any communications facility from the public rights-of-way, and the facility owner fails to remove or charge the same at its own expense to conform to the order within the time stated in the notice, the city may proceed to cause the communications facility to be removed. The expense thereby incurred except as provided in F.S. § 337.403(1)(a)—(c), shall be paid out of any money available therefor, and such expense shall be charged against the registrant of the communications facility and levied, collected and paid to the city. 
(r)  Subject to F.S. § 337.403, whenever it shall be necessary for the City to remove or relocate any communications facility, the registrant of the communications facility shall be given notice of such removal or relocation and an order requiring the payment of the costs thereof, and shall be given reasonable time, which shall not be less than twenty (20) nor more than thirty (30) days in which to appear before the city council to contest the reasonableness of the order. Should the registrant not appear, the determination of the cost to the registrant shall be final, in accordance with F.S. § 337.404. 
(s)  A final order of the city shall constitute a lien on any property of the registrant and may be enforced by filing an authenticated copy of the order in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county wherein the registrant's property is located and/or by drawing upon the registrant's permanent performance bond. All costs and expenses referenced in this section 14-69, that are the responsibility of the registrant, shall not be deducted from or credited against any other fees or taxes that the registrant may be required to pay to the city pursuant to this article. 
(t)  The city retains the right and privilege to cut or move any communications facilities located within the public rights-of-way of the city, as the city may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the city shall attempt to notify the registrant of the communications facility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a communications facility and shall notify the registrant of the communications facility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility. The registrant shall be responsible for costs and expenses incurred for such emergency repairs and construction. 
(u)  The city shall have the right to make such inspections of facilities placed or maintained in public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this article. The city shall have access without charge to any manholes or handholes at any time, of a communications services provider in which the city has facilities, provided the city has given such provider reasonable prior notice so that such provider can have trained personnel present when the city accesses such manholes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city, in the proper exercise of its municipal police powers and duties with respect to the public rights-of-way, shall have access to all manholes and handholes without charge of such provider. In the event the city determines that a violation exists with respect to registrant's placement or maintenance of facilities in the public rights-of-way that is not considered to be an emergency or danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the city will provide registrant no less than three (3) days written notice setting forth the violation and requesting correction. 
(v)  Following the completion of construction to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in the public rights-of-way, the registrant shall promptly provide revised plans and "as-builts" including, but not limited to, horizontal and vertical profiles, within sixty (60) days after completion of any installation or construction. The plans shall be in a digitized format, showing the two-dimensional location of the facilities, based on the city's geographical database or other format acceptable to the city. The registrant shall provide such plans at no cost to the city. The city shall maintain the confidentiality of such plans and any other information provided in accordance with F.S. § 202.195, as it may be amended. 
(w)  To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, a registrant shall allow city facilities to be collocated within city's public rights-of-way through the use of a joint trench during registrant's construction project. Such joint trench projects shall be negotiated in good faith by separate agreement between registrant and city and may be subjected to other city rights-of-way requirements. The city further reserves without limitation the right to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the city and within said limits as same may from time to time be altered. 
(x)  A registrant shall, on the request of any person holding a permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its communications facilities to permit the work authorized by the permit. The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of facilities shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the registrant shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The registrant shall be given not less than thirty (30) days' advance written notice to arrange for such temporary relocation. If the city requests a temporary raising or lowering of a facility for a public purpose, the city shall not be charged for the temporary raising or lowering of the facility. 
(y)  This article does not authorize a person to collocate or attach wireless facilities, including any antenna, micro wireless facility, or small wireless facility, on a privately owned utility pole, a utility pole owned by an electric cooperative or a municipal electric utility, a privately owned wireless support structure, or other private property without the consent of the property owner. 
(z)  Abandonment. Upon determination by a registrant or communications services provider that one (1) or more of its communications facilities in the public rights-of-way is to be abandoned, the provider shall notify the city no later than ninety (90) days from such determination, or no later than thirty (30) days following such abandonment, whichever is sooner. The city may independently establish that a communications facility has been abandoned. In reaching such determination, the city may request documentation and/or affidavits from the communications services provider or registrant regarding the active use of the facility. If the provider or registrant fails to provide the requested documentation within thirty (30) days, a rebuttable presumption shall exist that the provider or registrant has abandoned the communications facility. Any small wireless facility, micro wireless facility, utility pole for collocation of a small wireless facility, or other communications facility installed within the public rights-of-way that is abandoned shall be removed by the registrant or communications services provider at its expense within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the city. Failure to remove an abandoned facility within the thirty (30) days' period shall be deemed to be the registrant's or communications provider's consent for the city to remove the facility at the registrant's or provider's expense or for the city to allow another person to remove the facility at the registrant's or provider's expense. The communications services provider or registrant shall be responsible for all damage to the public rights-of-way and any facilities or utilities damaged as a result of such removal, and shall restore the public rights-of-way as required in this subjection. 
(aa)  If there are two (2) or more users of a single facility, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the facility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the facility is attached to an existing structure that has an independent function such as a light pole, intersection signal, pedestrian signal, utility pole or the like, said abandonment of the facility requires removal of the facility only and does not require the removal of the existing structure. 
(Ord. No. 18-15 , § 2, 11-13-18)  
Sec. 14-109. - Development and objective design standards. 
(a)  Terms and conditions for collocation on city utility poles.

The replaced pole shall continue to be owned by the city. 
(3)  The rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a city utility pole shall be one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per pole annually, or the highest rate authorized by applicable law. This amount shall not be deducted from any fees or taxes that may be due to the city. The fee shall be paid upon the city's issuance of a permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a city utility pole and annually thereafter. 
(4)  Agreements between the city and wireless providers that were in effect on July 1, 2017, and that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on city utility poles, remain in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions. The wireless provider may accept the rates, fees, and terms established under this article for small wireless facilities and utility poles that are the subject of an application submitted after the rates, fees, and terms become effective. 
(5)  For a city utility pole that supports an aerial facility used to provide communications services or electric service, the parties shall comply with the process for make-ready work under 47 U.S.C. § 224 and implementing regulations. The good faith estimate of the city for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation must include pole replacement if necessary. 
(6)  For a city utility pole that does not support an aerial facility used to provide communications services or electric service, the city shall provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation, including necessary pole replacement, within sixty (60) days after receipt of a complete application. Make-ready work, including any pole replacement, must be completed within sixty (60) days after written acceptance of the good faith estimate by the applicant. Alternatively, the city may require the applicant seeking to collocate a small wireless facility to provide a make-ready estimate at the applicant's expense for the work necessary to support the small wireless facility, including pole replacement, and perform the make-ready work. If pole replacement is required, the scope of the make-ready estimate is limited to the design, fabrication, and installation of a utility pole that is substantially similar in color and composition. The city may not condition or restrict the manner in which the applicant obtains, develops, or provides the estimate or conducts the make-ready work subject to usual construction restoration standards for work in the right-of-way. The replaced or altered utility pole shall remain the property of the city. 
(7)  The city may not require more make-ready work than is required to meet applicable codes or industry standards. Fees for make-ready work may not include costs related to preexisting damage or prior noncompliance. Fees for make-ready work, including any pole replacement, may not exceed actual costs or the amount charged to communications services providers other than wireless services providers for similar work and may not include any consultant fee or expense. 
(8)  A collocation of a small wireless facility on a city utility pole shall comply with all applicable codes, and shall not compromise the City utility pole's finish, functionality, or structural integrity particularly with respect to vulnerability to high velocity wind conditions. 
(9)  A collocation of a small wireless facility on a city utility pole shall not affect the city's ability to remove or to replace the pole in its sole discretion. Within thirty (30) days after receiving notification that the city intends to remove or to replace the utility pole, the registrant shall remove its collocated small wireless facility at its cost. If the registrant fails to do so, the city may remove the facility and charge all costs, including collection costs to the registrant. 
(b)  Location context and public safety regulations. A proposed communications facility shall comply with the following location context requirements unless waived by the city. In conjunction with granting such waiver, the city may require conditions on the permit approving such facility. 
(1)  A registrant shall comply with all applicable provisions of state law and city ordinances, applicable codes and regulations, quasi-judicially approved conditions for approvals, settlement agreements, applicable contracts, applicable court orders, and applicable provisions of federal statutes, FCC regulations and PSC regulations with respect to locations for placing or maintaining a communications facility in the public rights-of-way.

(7)  The city may prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within the public rights-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests to place and maintain facilities and utilities in the proposed location of the public rights-of-way, or to accommodate city plans for public improvements, capital improvements projects or projects the city determines are in the public interest. 
(8)  Facilities to be installed underground. All facilities shall be subject to the city's non-discriminatory undergrounding requirements that prohibit above-ground utilities and structures in the public rights-of-way. Consistent with article VII, section 7.7 of the city's Consolidated Land Development Regulations, all electric, telephone, cable television, and other communication lines, to the greatest extent possible, shall be placed underground unless waived by the city. 
(9)  All new communications facilities shall be placed underground, to the extent that new utilities other than fire hydrants are required to be located underground, including new electric and communications utilities. In addition, to the extent required by applicable PSC rules and regulations, applicable codes, restrictive covenants, quasi-judicially approved conditions of a development, planned unit development, community development district, or court order, a registrant shall install its facilities underground unless waived by the city. Additionally, a registrant shall endeavor to place all new facilities underground unless prevented from doing so by existing technology or by the physical characteristics of the installation location. 
a.  A registrant shall not place or maintain new utility poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities or small wireless facilities in a location in the public rights-of-way where electric and communications utilities are required to be installed underground, unless waived by the city. 
b.  Proposed new wireline fiber or coaxial backhaul facilities for small wireless facilities shall be installed underground consistent with applicable codes, unless waived by the city. 
c.  Conversion of overhead utilities to underground. No utility poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities, micro wireless facilities, ground mounted small wireless facilities, or small wireless facilities collocated on utility poles shall be placed in a location in the public rights-of-way where the city has determined that existing above ground electric and communications utilities should be removed and relocated underground, unless waived by the city. The presence of small wireless facilities or micro wireless facilities shall not be a basis not to comply with the city's requirements to convert above ground utilities to underground. To comply with the city's undergrounding requirements, a registrant shall remove its small wireless facilities, micro wireless facilities, and utility poles for collocation of small wireless facilities at its expense within sixty (60) days of being notified by the city that such facilities must be removed. The city shall have the right to remove such facilities at the registrant's expense if the registrant fails to do so. 
(10)  Communications facilities, including but not limited to small wireless facilities and utility poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities shall not be placed in a location which violates rules and regulations set by Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the National Electrical Safety Code or the North American Electric Reliability Corporation standards.

(11)  No communications facilities, including but not limited to small wireless facilities or utility poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities shall be placed or maintained in any location that is subject to or that would interfere with the city's drainage plan or that would interfere with the city's stormwater management facilities, or flood plain management areas. 
(12)  Prohibition against placement within a location subject to homeowners' association restrictions. Small wireless facilities shall not be placed in a location subject to covenants, restrictions, articles of incorporation, or bylaws of a homeowners' association unless specifically authorized by the homeowners' association. For purposes of this subsection, a location in a public right-of-way that abuts parcels within a homeowners' association on both sides of its width shall be considered a location subject to covenants, restrictions, articles of incorporation, or bylaws of such homeowners' association. This subsection shall not apply to limit the installation, placement, maintenance, or replacement of micro wireless facilities on any existing and duly authorized aerial communications facility. 
(13)  Placement in relation to adjacent uses of property and building facades thereon. Where parking and/or loading spaces are not permitted between a building facade and the corresponding property line (i.e. front facade and front property line, side street facade and side street property line) by design standard, or such spaces do not exist in those locations on existing properties, new communication facilities and new utility poles for collocation of small wireless facilities shall be placed in-line with the common, interior side lot lines and shall not be placed in-line with the front/principal facade of a residence, place of business, or any other principal use building located on property that abuts the public-rights-of-way. 
(14)  A structure granted a permit and installed pursuant to this article shall comply with F.S. ch. 333, and any city code, state and federal regulations pertaining to airport airspace protections. 
(15)  Historic preservation. This article does not limit the city's authority to enforce historic preservation zoning regulations consistent with the preservation of local zoning authority under 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7), the requirements for facility modifications under 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a), or the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the regulations adopted to implement such laws. Communications facilities shall not be permitted to be collocated on or to interfere with historic properties or landmarks that may be within or adjacent to the public rights-of-way unless waived by the city. The city shall not allow small wireless facilities, utility poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities or micro wireless facilities to be located in a manner that would impact negatively historic properties or landmarks unless waived by the city. Historic properties and landmarks may be so designated as being listed in the National Register of Historic Places pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, a property within a National Register-listed district, or individually listed in a city Register of Historic Places, pursuant to city ordinance adopted on or prior to April 1, 2017. 
(c)  Objective design standards. 
(1)  Intent and purpose. Small wireless facilities in the public rights-of-way and utility poles installed or repurposed in the public rights-of-way for collocation of small wireless facilities shall be designed in such a manner to maximize compatibility and to minimize any negative visual impact on the surrounding neighborhood. The objective design standards contained in this article regulating the location context, color, stealth design, and concealment of the proposed small wireless facility shall apply, unless waived by the city. 
(2)  Applicants shall not place or maintain signage on communications facilities in public rights-of-way, unless otherwise required by federal or state law, provided; however, existing structures that lawfully supported signage before being repurposed may continue to support signage as otherwise permitted by law. 
(3)  A small wireless facility shall not have any type of lighted signal, lights, or illuminations unless required by applicable codes, local codes or regulations, a permit issued by the city, or state and federal laws and regulations. 
(4)  Design standards for utility poles. Stealth design for new or replaced utility poles for collocation of small wireless facilities. All proposed new or replaced utility poles for collocation of small wireless facilities shall meet the design standards contained in this subsection unless waived by the city. 
a.  A replaced or restructured utility pole to accommodate the collocation of a small wireless facility shall be in substantially the same hole as the original utility pole. 
b.  The replaced or restructured utility pole shall be substantially similar in finish, base and pole design, diameter, material and height as the original pole being replaced, unless the city requires a different design, color or composition to be consistent with applicable city standards for new utility poles. 
c.  Unless waived by the city, the height for a new utility pole or replaced utility pole installed pursuant to this article shall not exceed the height of the tallest existing utility pole as of July 1, 2017, in the same right-of-way, measured from grade, in place within five hundred (500) feet of the proposed location of the small wireless facility. If there is no utility pole within five hundred (500) feet in the same public right-of-way as of July 1, 2017, the height shall be limited to fifty (50) feet measured from grade. Height shall include only the height of the utility pole and shall not include any light, antennas, masts or other attachments to the utility pole. 
d.  Unless waived by the city, a new utility pole shall be designed to be substantially similar in design to other utility poles in the same block or vicinity of the public rights-of-way. Such design aspects to follow include the material, base, pole diameter and style, location and style of attachments, finish, and cap, as applicable. By way of example, if existing utility poles in the same area of the public rights-of-way are light poles, the new utility pole should be designed substantially similar to such light poles and to the extent consistent with location context regulations, equidistant between existing poles. Unless waived by the city, or prohibited by applicable law, any such stealth utility pole for collocation of a small wireless facility shall function in the same manner as the facility it is intended to resemble in compliance with the city Code, at the expense of the registrant. By way of example, if a registrant installs a utility pole for collocation small wireless facility to resemble a nearby light pole, the registrant is encouraged to include a light operated in the same manner as other light poles, at the registrant's expense. 
e.  Notwithstanding this subsection, if the proposed location of a new utility pole for collocation of a small wireless facility is within a public right-of-way that is within a particular zoning district, planned unit development, community development district, community redevelopment agency, or a homeowners' association that has design standards applicable to utility poles, such proposed utility pole shall substantially comply with such design standards. 
f.  If there are no existing utility poles in close proximity to a new utility pole, the new utility pole shall be designed to resemble other utility poles in the public rights-of-way. 
(5)  Stealth design for collocation of small wireless facilities. 
a.  Small wireless facilities of up to six (6) cubic feet shall be collocated on a utility pole and may not be installed directly on the ground. Wires, cables and equipment to be collocated on a utility pole shall be within the utility pole or if not possible to being installed within the utility pole, covered with a shroud. No exposed wires or cables are permitted. Conduit shall not be installed on the exterior side of a utility pole. 
b.  If the utility pole for the proposed collocation of a small wireless facility is a light pole, a street light fixture substantially similar in design to the existing street light fixture shall be used to camouflage the small wireless facility such as through replacement of the cobra head with a new cobra head containing the small wireless facility, or a side-mounted light may be replaced with a substantially similarly designed side mounted light containing the small wireless facility. Unless consistent with the design of the utility pole, a small wireless facility shall not be collocated on a mast of a utility pole. In no event shall a small wireless facility be collocated on the mast of a utility pole that serves as a traffic signal pole. Any street light fixture installed by the registrant shall be maintained in good working order by the registrant at its cost. 
c.  Slim design shall be used wherein the top mounted antenna does not exceed the diameter of the supporting utility pole at the level of the antenna by more than twelve (12) inches attachment, and side mounted enclosures, if any, do not extend more than twenty-four (24) inches beyond the exterior dimensions of the existing structure, repurposed structure or utility pole at the level of antenna attachment measured from the edge of the pole to the outermost surface of the antenna. 
d.  Maximum height restrictions. A small wireless facility, including any attached antennas, shall not exceed ten (10) feet above the existing structure, repurposed structure or utility pole upon which the small wireless facility is to be collocated. A small wireless facility in the public rights-of-way shall not be used for the attachment of any communications facilities or fiber other than the equipment included within the small wireless facility. 
(6)  Small wireless facilities not collocated on utility poles or existing structures. 
a.  Ground-mounted small wireless facilities up to twenty-eight (28) cubic feet in dimension shall be located within a ten (10) foot radius of the existing structure or utility pole for the collocated small wireless facility. Pursuant to F.S. § 337.401(7)(b)(2), ground-mounted small wireless facilities shall be located with reasonable spacing of at least two hundred (200) feet from other ground-mounted small wireless facilities. 
b.

The city council hereby deletes all such references to "occupational license" and replaces said term with the term "local business tax receipt" and deletes all references to "license" (when referring to an occupational license) and replaces same with the term "receipt." 
Section 2 of said ordinance provides, "Complementary to the amendment set forth in Section 1 above, the City of South Daytona shall construe the local business tax receipt as a type of "permit" (i.e. a type of permission which is granted as a privilege and not as a right), which may only be issued (or renewed) to a business if the business is found through the application (or renewal) review process to be in compliance with all applicable city regulations and conditions, including, but not limited to, zoning requirements (unless the business is "grandfathered"), building inspections, state licensing documentation, etc."

Local business tax receipt required: It shall be unlawful for any owner of residential property to rent or lease, or offer to rent or lease (throughout this subsection (13) the terms "rent" and "lease" are synonymous; as are the terms "to rent or lease" and "to offer to rent or lease") therein any dwelling or dwelling unit(s), whether single-family, duplex, triplex, multi-family, apartment, condominium, or more than one (1) room, etc., unless a current local business tax receipt therefore has been issued by the city, a copy of which is to be available at the structure in which the dwelling unit(s) is located. There is no requirement for there to be a written lease or any evidence on monetary payment to establish a rental arrangement. A rental arrangement shall be presumed to exist when someone is residing in a residential structure who is not the owner of the property and someone with an ownership interest is also not residing in said structure at the same time. 
b.  Annual inspection required: Each dwelling unit licensed [permitted] for rental must pass an annual inspection by a city code inspector(s). The singular for the term "code inspector" or "inspector" includes the plural for purposes of this subsection (13), and the term is gender neutral. The purpose of the annual inspection shall be to determine compliance with the International Property Maintenance Code, other applicable codes, and the supplemental provisions of this subsection (13). Annual inspection of such properties shall be accomplished in a systematic manner according to administratively determined plans and schedules. 
c.  Exception for owner-occupied dwellings not renting more than one (1) room: No rental housing local business tax receipt or related annual housing inspection is required of any property owner who occupies a single-family dwelling and rents not more than one (1) room in that building, provided that nothing in this exception otherwise excuses such an owner from compliance with the International Property Maintenance Code or any other applicable code. 
d.  Local business tax receipt fee: The rental housing local business tax receipt fee shall be equal to the fee for a home local business tax receipt and a separate such fee shall be charged for each rental dwelling unit irrespective of the number of rental dwelling units under single ownership and irrespective of the number of local business tax receipts held by a particular local business tax receipt holder. 
e.  Local business tax receipt application: The owner of record of each dwelling unit which is rented, or offered for rent, with the exception of apartment buildings of four (4) units or more, shall make written application to the community development department for a rental housing local business tax receipt(s) to engage in the business of renting residential property, setting forth the address, classification (whether single-family, duplex, triplex, multifamily, apartment, condominium, or more than one (1) room) and lessee (if such exists) of each dwelling unit to be licensed [permitted] for rental, on such form or forms as the community development department shall from time to time designate. An agent of one (1) or more owners may apply for multiple local business tax receipts, upon written authorization from each owner represented, provided that such authorization acknowledges receipt of a copy of this subsection (13) and a copy of the International Property Maintenance Code and acknowledges that failure to abide by this subsection (13) or other applicable codes and ordinances may result in a fine and/or a lien upon the property of the owner. A single local business tax receipt is allowed to cover one (1) or more rental dwelling units under single ownership in the same structure however, a separate local business tax receipt fee shall be required for each rental dwelling unit covered and rental housing local business tax receipt. 
f.  Special inspection provisions: 
(i)  Special provisions for properties served with septic tanks. The city's annual rental housing inspection shall include an assessment of the condition of the septic tank system for any rental property not connected to a public sanitary sewer system. If the code inspector determines that the condition of the septic tank system is inadequate, the property owner shall be required to obtain the services of a licensed [permitted] septic tank contractor to inspect the system and repair or replace it (if necessary). 
(ii)  Special provisions for properties served by private potable water wells. Every year as part of the annual rental housing inspection, the local business tax receipt holder whose property is subject to inspection but not connected to a public potable water supply system shall provide to the inspector evidence that water from the private potable water source has been tested and found sanitary and potable through a standard and customary bacteriological test done by a state-certified laboratory within three (3) months of the date of inspection. The water sample for testing shall be taken by a qualified employee of the city public works department. 
(iii)  Rights of privacy and freedom from unreasonable search. Each local business tax receipt holder engaged in the business of renting residential property shall undertake to make such property available for reasonable inspection by the city code inspector to determine compliance with the International Property Maintenance Code, other applicable codes and the supplemental provisions of this article, provided that the city shall at all times honor the rights of the local business tax receipt holder and the lessee, as provided in this subsection: 
(1)  Inspections required under this subsection (13) shall be made only by a code inspector(s) designated by the city manager. No law enforcement officer may accompany a code inspector unless there is probable cause to believe that the inspector's personal safety is at risk during the inspection. No other person may accompany a code inspector without the consent of the local business tax receipt holder or lessee. 
(2)  The code inspector shall make his or her inspections during daylight hours, unless: 
a)  The code inspector has made an appointment for another inspection time, at the request of the lessee, or 
b)  The code inspector has previously attempted two (2) or more times to complete an inspection during daylight hours and has found no adult person on the premises authorized to admit the inspector. 
(3)  At the commencement of each inspection, the code inspector shall present credentials and identification and advise the local business tax receipt holder, lessee, or adult person authorized to admit the inspector that an inspection is required under the provisions of this subsection (13). If need be, the inspector shall provide the referenced occupant or other authorized person with a copy of this subsection (13). 
(4)  If the code inspector is denied admittance by the local business tax receipt holder or lessee, or if the code inspector fails in at least three (3) attempts to complete an inspection of the premises because there was no adult person on the premises to admit him, the inspector shall provide notice of failure of inspection to the local business tax receipt holder by certified mail to the address shown on the local business tax receipt or other legal service. Within ten (10) days after receipt or refusal of such notice, the local business tax receipt holder shall arrange the admittance of the inspector to the certified premises for the completion of the required inspection. If the local business tax receipt holder fails to arrange such admittance, the city council shall revoke the rental housing local business tax receipt and shall notify the local business tax receipt holder of such revocation by certified mail or other legal service. If the local business tax receipt holder thereafter continues to permit the rental of the premises for residential use without inspection, he shall be subject to proceedings before the code enforcement board for violation of this subsection (13) and for any other code violations which may be apparent. Nothing in this paragraph limits any other legal remedy available to the city. 
(5)  Notwithstanding any other enforcement provisions of chapter 16 of this Code, whenever the code inspector notices violations, the local business tax receipt holder shall be cited and enforcement pursued through the code enforcement process. 
(6)  The city shall administratively adopt an official rental housing inspection form, based upon the International Property Maintenance Code, with a checklist of items to be noted by the inspector. This form shall be made available to the public. Any rental housing inspection shall focus upon, but not necessarily be limited to, the items set out on such a checklist. 
g.  Emergency inspections and remediation: Nothing in this subsection (13) limits or supplants the power of the code inspector under the city's ordinances, rules and regulations, and the authority granted under state law, to take necessary action, consistent with the law, to protect the public from property which constitutes a public nuisance as defined under state law or city ordinances, codes or regulations and to abate such a nuisance by any other lawful means or proceedings.

Also, if the home is rented or leased, the applicant must provide a signed letter from the building owner or property manager giving the applicant permission to operate a business office from the residence. 
c.  Local business tax receipt fees: The fees for home local business tax receipts shall be as set forth in Appendix A, City of South Daytona Local Business Tax Receipt Codes and Fees, of the Consolidated Land Development Regulations of the city. 
d.  Home occupations are permitted as an accessory use to a dwelling unit in any district where residential uses are permitted subject to certain restrictions. The primary purpose and element of the home occupation must be a "home office"; any related activities must be incidental and secondary to the home office function. Home local business tax receipts shall be annotated with the term "office only" to emphasize the focus described herein. 
e.  Home occupations are limited to professional, vocational, business, trade and personal services that do not involve clients, customers, or non-resident employee visiting the premises. They may include off-site sales of customary hobby crafts produced at hobbyist volumes in the home by family members. 
f.  Prior to issuance of a home local business tax receipt, any occupation that is deemed by staff to be questionable in nature or that is likely to involve more than telephone, computer, or mail business transactions may be referred to the land development regulation board (LDRB), which will conduct a public hearing according to its established rules. After the public hearing, the LDRB will forward its recommendation to the city council for a final determination. 
g.  No home local business tax receipt shall be issued for a taxi service. 
h.  The home occupation shall be conducted only by persons who are residents of the dwelling. 
i.  The home occupation shall be conducted only within the principal building, which may include an attached garage—-however, the home office itself may not be located in an attached garage. No accessory structure shall be used as part of the home office.

k.  A home occupation shall not occupy more than twenty (20) percent of the living area of the residence, not including the area of an attached garage. 
l.  No articles, equipment, materials, or supplies used in conjunction with the home occupation shall be stored other than in the principal building so used, except that storage in an attached garage may be allowed if it does not exceed one-third ( 1/3 ) of the area of the garage. Storage in a detached garage may also be allowed if it does not exceed one-third ( 1/3 ) of the area of the garage and provided that space is left for the storage/parking of at least one (1) medium-sized automobile. 
m.  The home occupation shall be clearly incidental and subordinate to the residential use of the property, and there shall be no evidence of nonresidential use reflected in the appearance of the dwelling or property. 
n.  There shall be no outside storage of supplies associated with the home occupation. 
o.  No office equipment or stored materials shall be visible to the public from the street. 
p.  No equipment or process shall be used which creates visual or audible electrical interference in any radio or television receiver off the premises or causes fluctuations in line voltage off the premises.

Commercial vehicles such as trailers, beach wagons, ice cream trucks, and similar vehicles, whose primary use is for the business shall not be stored at the residence unless they are kept in an enclosed garage or otherwise legally stored in accordance with the aforementioned section 7.5. 
t.  No home occupation shall cause an increase in the use of any one (1) or more public utilities (water, sewer, electricity, garbage collection) to the point that the combined total usage for dwelling and home occupation purposes exceeds the customary average for similar type residences within the City of South Daytona. 
u.  Any business that involves storage, processes, employees, equipment or any other activity not permitted by this section shall provide proof (notarized statement from property owner/manager, copy of lease, etc.) of a properly zoned and licensed [permitted] business location (not the property for which the subject home local business tax receipt is to be issued) for conducting such activities. 
v.  Only if required by state statute, as in the case of a licensed real estate broker, for the purpose of identification, one (1) occupational sign per business location will be allowed, not to exceed two (2) square feet in size. Such a sign shall list only the name of the individual businessperson and the occupation. It must be unlighted and may only be installed on an exterior wall near the entrance of the residence where the occupation is conducted. 
w.  No merchandise or articles for sale shall be displayed for advertising purposes and no sign device relative to the sale thereof shall be displayed on the premises.

Sec. 16-42. - Established. 
A fee to be known as the "Interim Proprietary and General Services Fee" is hereby established. 
(Ord. No. 86-6, § 1, 4-8-86)  
Sec. 16-43. - Purpose. 
It is recognized that the costs of providing certain city services exceed the fees charged for said services, and that those costs are borne in large part through ad valorem taxation. These services which the city provides include, but are not limited to, police protection, fire protection, public works, administrative services, and capital projects. It is further recognized that, from the time a new building or structure is completed and occupied until the improvements are reflected on the tax roll as of the ensuing January first, the city is obligated to provide these services, as well as providing other direct services for which no part of the cost of the services is compensated. The purpose of the interim proprietary and general services fee, therefor, is to defray the cost to the city of providing city services to newly improved property prior to the imposition of ad valorem taxes on such property. The fee is not in any manner, directly or indirectly, intended as an ad valorem tax, nor is the amount of the fee established herein related in any way to the valuation of the property receiving said services. 
(Ord. No. 86-6, § 1, 4-8-86)  
Sec. 16-44. - Fee levied for services to certain properties. 
There is hereby levied an interim proprietary and general services fee which shall apply to those properties for which a certificate of occupancy is issued, either permanent or temporary, for full or partial use of the premises, and which shall be paid from the first day of the month following the date upon which such certificate of occupancy is issued until the ensuing January first. 
(Ord. No. 86-6, § 1, 4-8-86)  
Sec. 16-45. - When paid. 
The interim proprietary and general services fee shall be paid upon the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, and the certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until such time as the interim proprietary and general services fee has been paid. 
(Ord. No. 86-6, § 1, 4-8-86)  
Sec. 16-46. - Initial rate. 
The interim proprietary and general services fee shall initially be eight dollars ($8.00) per unit per month from the first day of the month following the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy. For the purposes of this section, a "unit" shall be defined as a single-family residence; each dwelling unit of a townhouse, duplex, or multi-family dwelling; a single tenant industrial space; a retail store or a single tenant space in an office or commercial building. For structures such as warehouses, shell buildings, or large commercial or retail buildings, which are not leased as single tenant space, the fee shall be based on eight dollars ($8.00) for each two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet or portion thereof. The term shall not include maintenance, remodeling or additions to units, such as additional rooms, pools, and fences, for which no interim proprietary and general services fee shall be required. 
(Ord. No. 86-6, § 1, 4-8-86)  
Sec. 16-47. - Method of payment. 
Payment of the interim proprietary and general services fee shall be paid monthly. Monthly billings from the city shall be included with the city utility bills where practical. 
(Ord. No. 86-6, § 1, 4-8-86)  
Sec. 16-48. - Fee revisions. 
The city council may revise the interim proprietary and general services fee rate at the beginning of each fiscal year, rounding the monthly rate to the nearest five dollars ($5.00). The calculation of the revised fee shall be based upon adopted general fund budgeted expenditures less anticipated franchise fees, utility taxes, fines and forfeitures, charges for services, and other revenues from "user-based fees" as may be appropriate, divided by the estimated number of units defined herein, and prorated on a monthly basis, provided, however, that the fee may not be increased by more than twenty-five (25) percent from one (1) year to the next except upon the adoption of a resolution by the city council approving such increase. 
(Ord. No. 86-6, § 1, 4-8-86)  
Sec. 16-49. - Exemptions. 
The interim proprietary and general services fee shall not be levied upon: 
(1)  Any improvements for which a building permit application was filed prior to the effective date of Ordinance No. 86-6; 
(2)  Any improvement to property which is exempt from ad valorem taxation by Florida Law, or which is used primarily by an organization the income of which is exempt from federal income tax.

(Ord. No. 04-21, § 1, 7-27-04)  
Sec. 18-10. - Imposition. 
(a)  Applicability of fee. 
(1)  Any person who makes or causes the making of an improvement to land which will generate additional traffic and which requires the issuance of a building permit, or any person who changes the use of any building to one which will generate additional traffic, shall be required to pay a transportation impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this section. 
(2)  No person shall undertake construction of an improvement for which the fee imposed by this article is applicable without being assessed the proper transportation impact fee imposed by this article. No person shall change the use or allow a change in use of any building where the fee imposed by this article is applicable without being assessed the proper transportation impact fee imposed by this article. 
(b)  Payment of fee required prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. No county or municipal building permit shall be issued for any activity requiring payment of an impact fee pursuant to this article shall be issued unless and until the transportation impact fee required by this article has been assessed. The obligation of a person to pay the fee imposed by this article shall not be extinguished by the inadvertent failure of the city to collect the fee at the time required. 
(c)  Methods of determination. The transportation for any development activity generating traffic in the city shall be determined either by using the method set forth in subsection (1) of this subsection (c) or by using the fee schedule set forth in subsection (3) of this subsection (c). 
(1)  Independent calculation. Any person may determine their transportation impact fee by providing independent traffic documentation that their impact on the thoroughfare system is less than the transportation impact fee as determined under subsection (3) of this subsection (c). The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the transportation impact fee has been calculated, which shall conform to the following factors: 
a.  The trip generation rate, trip length and the percent of new trips shall be documented together. In no event shall they be documented separately. All other variables in the transportation impact fee formula cannot be altered, but shall be based upon data current at the time this fee shall be due. Petitioners requesting to undertake an independent calculation may substitute the trip generation rate and the percent of new trips and trip length in the transportation impact fee formula with data obtained from approved traffic surveys and actual traffic counts generated by approved traffic study sites. The transportation impact fee formula is identified and explained in subsection (2) of this subsection (c). 
b.  The unit of measure used for trip generation in the independent calculation must be identical to the one used in the transportation impact fee formula, in order to measure accurately the project's impact on the thoroughfare system. 
c.  If a single business or shopping center is studied, at least two (2) sites within the City of South Daytona must be tested. The results of each site must be added together and averaged to obtain an alternative trip generation rate, trip length and percent of new trips. The results can be substituted in the transportation impact fee formula. If the study results indicate a lower fee, the charges will be adjusted accordingly. 
d.  If no suitable alternative site is available as determined by the city staff, the applicant may pay the transportation impact fee, and employ a licensed engineer to conduct a traffic study on the project site within six months after the enterprise is open for business. The traffic study timeframe and monitoring points must be approved by the city staff. Only the trip generation rate, trip length and the percent of new trips can be used in the analysis. Once the results of each sampling point are added together and averaged they may be substituted in the transportation impact fee formula. The results will be used to determine an appropriate impact fee. If the traffic study results indicate a lower fee and accepted by the city staff, the difference will be refunded to the applicant. All refunds are subject to section 94-107. This documentation shall be prepared and presented by licensed engineers. Specific actions such as the number of manual or automated counts, number of personal surveys, location of the sampling stations and the layout of the study sites will be negotiated by the applicant and city staff. 
(2)  Transportation impact fee formula. The following formula shall be used to determine the impact fee per unit of development: 
Impact Fee = (½)*(TGR)*(%NT)*(DF)*(ATL)*(CC/LM)°WCL 
Where: 	TGR = 	trip generation rate assigned to each land use 
	NT = 	new trips generated by the land use 
	DF = 	distribution factor of trips utilizing the thoroughfare network 
	ATL = 	average trip length utilizing the thoroughfare network 
	CC = 	average road construction cost 
	LM = 	lane miles 
	WCL = 	weighted capacity per lane mile 
 
(3)  Fee schedule. The following fee schedule has been prepared based upon the formula presented in subsections (1) and (2) of this subsection (c) using in part the Ghyabi and Associates (G&A) impact fee study, completed June, 2004, and using 2018 updated average roadway construction costs and updated applicable credits.

b.  Credits for completed and accepted non-site-related improvements, as described in subsection (1) of this subsection (c), shall be determined for each application, and shall be deducted from the transportation impact fees listed in the transportation road impact fee schedule, at the time transportation impact fees are to be paid. The value of non-site-related improvements for which credits may be allowed shall be determined by the city manager or designee. 
c.  Credits for the present value of future gas or motor fuel tax payments utilized to fund capacity expansion of the thoroughfare road systems are included in the calculations of the fee schedule set out in this section. 
d.  The fees charged for a building with more than one (1) use shall be for that use having the highest traffic generation rate except for church buildings with mixed uses or buildings with residential and non-residential mixed uses. If the church building has more than one (1) use, the separate uses are to be identified and appropriately charged according to the fee schedule. If a building has residential and non-residential uses, the square footage of the building identified as residential will be charged based on the number of dwelling units, and then, the square footage identified as non-residential shall be charged for that use having the highest traffic generation rate. 
e.  If the type of development activity for which a building permit is applied is not specified on the fee schedule set out in this section, the city shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. The city shall be guided in the selection of a comparable type by the report titled "Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation: An Information Report" (sixth or any subsequent editions). If the city determines that there is no comparable type of land use on the fee schedule set out in this section, then the fee shall be determined by using traffic generation statistics contained in the report titled "Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation: An Information Report" (sixth or any subsequent edition), average trip length and percent of new trips based upon the best data available to the city and by applying the formula set forth in subsection (1) of this subsection. 
f.  In the case of an expansion of an existing use on the same lot or an adjoining lot (which may be intersected by an easement or right-of-way) requiring the issuance of a building permit, the impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new as compared to the previous use. Provided, however, the impact fee shall be reduced by fifty (50) percent from the amount of the fee that would otherwise be due and payable for an expansion to an existing use. The city shall be guided in this determination by the report titled "Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation: An Information Report" (sixth or any subsequent edition). 
g.  In the event the impact fee rate for a particular land use is changed subsequent to the issuance of a building permit and before the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the impact fee shall be the amount in effect on the date payment is received. Provided further, that an initial application for a site plan development order has been filed with the city and provided that the project developer has applied for a building permit before the effective date of these regulations, a project shall not be subject to the transportation impact fee. 
h.  The transportation impact fee on a shopping center shall be computed using one (1) retail-commercial rate for all stores except the out-parcels, which shall be calculated using the rate for that land use from the transportation impact fee schedule. 
i.  If an affidavit is filed by the owner of real property with the county or municipality certifying that a farm building on a farm is exempt from issuance of a building permit under Florida law, then the building shall also be exempt from impact fee charges. 
j.  Road construction and right-of-way credits issued by the department of community development can be transferred between lots with identical land uses. 
k.  Transportation road impact fees for private universities and colleges shall be based on the number of additional full-time equivalent ("FTE") students that any improvements to the school are designed to accommodate. The fee shall be based on 2.38 trips per FTE as indicated by the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual, Sixth Edition. Individual studies shall be utilized to demonstrate the average trip length for each proposed project, if the project results in an increase in the planned FTE student capacity. The college or university president shall certify that the project shall not increase said FTE's. 
l.  The transportation impact fees established above shall increase annually effective October first beginning on October 1, 2019 by the Consumer Price Index as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor for the South Eastern United States for All Goods. 
(Ord. No. 04-21, § 1, 7-27-04; Ord. No. 18-23 , § 1, 1-8-19)  
Sec. 18-11. - Payment. 
(a)  Time of payment; lien. 
(1)  The person applying for the issuance of a building permit shall pay the transportation impact fee prior to the issuance of the building permit. The city shall issue an impact fee statement to the applicant for a building permit. Such impact fee statement shall set forth the amount of the impact fee paid. 
The obligation for payment of the impact fee shall run with the land. However, this section shall not be construed to relieve an applicant of responsibility or liability for payment of the impact fees imposed by this article. 
In the event the impact fee is not paid prior to the issuance of a building permit for the affected impact construction, the city may collect the impact fee, together with interest, as provided in section 18-11(d). 
If no building permit is required upon a change of use of a building, the fee imposed by this article shall be payable at such time as the person making such change shall be required to apply for a local business tax receipt. 
(2)  All fees due under this article shall become a lien at the time of the issuance of the building permit or in the case of a change of use on the issuance of a local business tax receipt, as the case may be, such fees shall be due, and shall remain a lien, coequal with the lien of all state, district, county and municipal taxes, superior in dignity to all other liens, titles and claims, until paid. Such lien shall be upon the land on which an improvement is made requiring the payment of fees and shall be for the amount of the fee required, as well as for all penalties and interest due under the provisions of this article. 
(b)  Method of payment. Payment of transportation impact fees shall be made to the City of South Daytona. 
(c)  Disposition of funds. All funds collected shall be promptly transferred for deposit into a transportation impact fee trust fund and used solely for the purposes specified in this article. 
(d)  Interest and administrative; penalty. 
(1)  Interest at the rate set by law for judgments shall be due on all fees due under this article from the time such fee was due according to the terms of subsection (a) of this section. The inclusion in this article of provisions concerning interest due shall be deemed to be cumulative of the city's rights already existing as a matter of law to prejudgment interest upon sums which are certain and due and payable at a specific time. Accordingly, the requirement for the payment of interest shall be deemed to apply retroactively to all fees which have previously become due under the terms of this article; and nothing in this article shall be construed in derogation of such right otherwise existing at law. 
(2)  There shall be due and payable to the city an administrative penalty of five (5) percent per month to a maximum of twenty-five (25) percent of all fees unpaid at the time they were due according to the terms of this article. Such administrative penalty shall accrue monthly on the anniversary of the date when such fee should have been paid. In the case of fees previously due under the terms of this article, such penalty shall accrue at the rate of five (5) percent per month to a maximum of twenty-five (25) percent with the first monthly penalty accruing one (1) month following the effective date of the ordinance from which this subsection (e) is derived. 
The city attorney or a duly authorized representative may execute, serve upon the owner by certified mail and record a notice of nonpayment in the official records of the county, which shall contain the legal description of the property and the amount of the impact fee liability. Said notice shall thereupon operate as a lien against such property for the amount of the impact fee, together with interest, penalties, and the costs and fees for collection, coequal with the lien of all state, county, district and municipal taxes. 
(Ord. No. 04-21, § 1, 7-27-04; Ord. No. 07-03, § 1, 2-13-07)  
Sec. 18-12. - Trust funds; use of funds. 
(a)  Trust funds. There are hereby established a separate transportation impact fee trust fund. Subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, should any parcel or area of land located within a zone be annexed into the city, the boundaries shall be deemed amended as of the date of annexation so as to include the land annexed within the zone of such municipality. Such amendment of zones shall be for the purposes of this article only and shall not affect any prior payment of fees or expenditure of funds attributable to the annexed property. 
(b)  Use of funds; administrative fee. 
(1)  Funds collected from transportation impact fees shall be used for the purpose of capital improvements to and expansion of transportation facilities associated with the thoroughfare system plan. Such improvements shall be of the type made necessary by new development. Final determination of projects to be funded using transportation impact fee revenues shall be made by the city council.

ARTICLE III. - GOLF CART REGULATIONS 
 
Sec. 18-20. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The city council has elected to enact an ordinance regarding golf cart operation and equipment which is more restrictive than those enumerated in F.S. § 316.212, relating to the operation of golf carts on roadways to protect the public health, safety, welfare and to ensure the protection of pedestrian bicycle and all vehicular travel within the City of South Daytona and its citizenry. 
(b)  The city council has determined that certain city-maintained streets are uniformly configured by platting and right of way designation; that golf carts are currently an accepted mode of limited destination travel; that traffic counts do not generate negative results germane to restricted golf cart use and legislation; that use of golf carts has been reviewed, investigated, and analyzed by TMH Consulting and Lassiter Transportation Group and no negative findings were generated; and the City of South Daytona has found it operationally and economically feasible to implement F.S. (2008) § 316.212. 
(c)  It is the intent of the city council of the City of South Daytona to protect the public health, safety and welfare and to ensure the protection of the traveling public and the citizens of the City of South Daytona by this legislative enactment. 
(Ord. No. 09-13, § 1, 9-22-09)  
Sec. 18-21. - Use of golf carts within City of South Daytona. 
(a)  In accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 316.212 relating to the operation of golf carts on roadways, the operation of a golf cart upon the streets of the city is permitted on streets within the municipal limits of South Daytona in the area that is east of Nova Road, West of U.S. 1 and south of Beville Road. Reed Canal, Nova Road, U.S. 1, Big Tree Road and Beville Road are not included in the public streets that golf carts can travel on. Golf cart crossings are allowed at official traffic controlled intersections. The city council has determined that golf carts may safely travel on and/or cross, considering the facts of speed, volume, and the character of pedestrian, nonmotorized travel and all motor vehicle traffic, using the streets within the above designated area of the City of South Daytona. 
(b)  The city manager, or designee, shall post appropriate signs to alert the public of golf cart usage in designated areas. 
(c)  A golf cart may be operated on those streets identified in (a) above at any time between sunrise and sunset as long as the golf cart complies with the safety requirements of F.S. § 316.212, as amended, for daylight driving. Golf carts are also allowed to be driven between sunset and 12:00 midnight on those public areas, parks and streets that are permitted and authorized provided the golf cart is equipped with equipment required by F.S. § 316.212, as amended, for night time driving. In addition a licensed driver must be in the golf cart at all times when the golf cart is driven at any time, day or night. 
(d)  No golf cart shall be driven, operated, or controlled on the public areas, parks, road or streets of the City of South Daytona unless the golf cart has a visible City of South Daytona permit tag on the golf cart that is current and unrevoked indicating compliance with all necessary laws. An administrative fee, to be established by resolution, for the permit shall be issued only to a specific golf cart. The chief of police, or authorized designee, upon compliance with this section and all other applicable state and federal law, shall inspect each golf cart for compliance, issue and install required permits. Each permit shall be issued in the month of January or will be renewed in the month of January. Further, any permit issued is subject to administrative revocation by the city for noncompliance with any local, state, or federal law or regulation germane to the operation of golf carts. The chief of police, or designee, shall issue a letter of revocation to the permittee and the golf cart permit shall be returned to the issuing authority of the city. 
(e)  Golf carts may access the eight-foot sidewalk on the south-east side of Big Tree Road and public parks including sidewalks within the parks that are located in eligible permitted golf cart designated areas. Golf carts must yield to pedestrians at all times. While driven on a side-walk golf carts must not exceed the speed of fifteen (15) mph. 
(f)  Municipal employees for municipal purposes, including, but not limited to, police patrol, traffic enforcement, and inspection of public facilities, shall be authorized to operate golf carts, low-speed vehicles and utility vehicles pursuant and subject to the authority granted in F.S. § 316.2126, and subject to and in compliance with all the restrictions contained herein, except for the time limitations contained in subsection (c) above, which are waived, and is unrestricted.

Sec. 18-22. - Penalties. 
(a)  City law enforcement officers and community service officers shall have the authority to issue citations for violations of this chapter on approved citation forms. The citation shall describe the nature of golf cart violation, the location of the incident(s), indicate the amount of the fine, that the violator has the option to contest the violation with the city's special master and give notice to the violator that the fine must be paid within ten (10) days. The fine amount shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00) if paid within ten (10) days. If not paid within ten (10) days of issuance, a late fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) will be added. If the violator refuses to execute the citation, fails to pay the fine within twenty (20) days of issuance or if requested by the violator, the case will be referred to the special master.

Sec. 20-32. - Minimum advanced security payment; meter rate; service charges; consumption charges; minimum use; interest on minimum advanced security payment. 
(a)  Advanced security payments, base rates and conservation rates for consumption charges for use of the city's water system for services within the city's service area shall be established and amended by resolution adopted by the city council. A base rate for consumption charges shall be established along with a conservation rate for gallons exceeding the base. The rates set forth in the resolution adopted by the city council shall not apply to or in any way limit pass-through charges for water consumption as said charges are defined below. 
The city will require a real estate settlement statement, warranty deed or property tax bill as proof of ownership from utility customers claiming ownership status. 
The minimum charge per month for water shall be the amount of the service delivery charge plus the consumption charge for the first one thousand (1,000) gallons times the number of units. The service delivery charge for a nonresidential master meter account (meter serving more than one (1) unit) shall be computed at the five-eighths ( 5/8 ) by three-quarters (¾) size rate times the total number of units served. 
(b)  The increase or decrease in the charges for the consumption of water within the city's service area shall automatically pass-through to the customers on a cent-for-cent basis equal to the adjustment charged to the city by the City of Daytona Beach. 
The additional charge levied under this section shall be known as a pass-through charge. In determining whether a proposed increase is an increase to the base rate or a pass-through charge, the following definitions shall apply: 
Base rate charge shall be the rate established in the schedule above. 
Pass-through charge shall be equal to the amount of any increase or decrease in the contract rate for water charged to the city by the City of Daytona Beach pursuant to the contract providing for rendition of water and sewer treatment service between the City of Daytona Beach and the City of South Daytona, executed June 1, 1994, as amended. The pass-through charges shall be automatically billed to the customers on a cent for cent basis equal to the adjustment from Daytona Beach, which includes both the true-up to actual cost for the previous year and the projected rate from for the next year. The adjustment shall automatically occur on June 1, 2008 and automatically on the same date each year thereafter without action by the city council. Beginning June 1, 2008, the pass-through of the Daytona Beach adjustment shall be identified separately on each customer's bill and shall be adjusted annually based on the pass-through charge from Daytona Beach. Pass-through adjustments shall be rounded to the nearest cent. 
(c)  The city council hereby authorizes an annual adjustment to the water service delivery charge, the minimum charge for the first one thousand (1,000) gallons or part thereof and the consumption charges equal to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the Southeast Region For All Consumer Goods as published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics for the twelve (12) months ending on the March 31 prior to the effective date of the annual increase. The annual CPI increase will first go into effect on June 1, 2003 and shall be automatically adjusted annually on the same date without further action of the city council. Beginning June 1, 2008, the Daytona Beach pass-through charge shall be a separate line item on the customer's bill and the CPI adjustment shall not be applied to this pass-through charge. The CPI adjustment shall be applied to the base rate as of June 1, 2007, as adjusted in the future. 
(d)  The city shall, at all times, maintain and collect rates and charges for water distribution and sewage treatment at least equal to the rates charged by the City of Daytona Beach. 
(1)  The minimum advanced security payment for meters shall be subject to periodic evaluation by the city. Water bills for accounts which have been disconnected for nonpayment two (2) times in any twelve-calendar-month period shall be subject to such evaluation. If the minimum advanced security payment of any of these accounts is less than the average uncollected balance for the six-month period preceding the evaluation, an additional minimum advanced security deposit payment shall be required for the account before reconnection. The amount of the minimum advanced security payment plus the additional minimum advanced security payment shall be equal to the amount of the average of the three (3) months with the highest uncollected balance during the six-month evaluation period. 
(2)  Minimum advanced security payments on any account, regardless of meter size, shall not be transferable to another person or party, with the exception of a spouse, sibling or child. 
(3)  If a person desires to relocate within the city, and the current utility account is in good standing, the deposit may be transferred to the new location. 
(4)  In the event that the property is a rental or lease property, regardless of the number of units or whether the property is residential or commercial, and the rental property is determined to be a problem property as defined below, the city may require all future utility accounts for all rental property of the owner in the city to be in the owner's name without reference to or acknowledgement of the tenant. An owner may request the problem property designation be removed, thereby allowing future tenants to put utility accounts in the tenants' name, if there are no accounts shutoff for non-payment in any of the owner's rental properties in the city for a period of up to two (2) years. In the event that utility service to a property is discontinued for any reason, service shall not be restored to the property until all delinquent and current charges are paid except as required by F.S. § 180.135 (1988). 
(5)  A problem property is hereby defined as a rental property or complex at which utility service has been discontinued for non-payment during a twelve-month period a number of times exceeding five (5) per cent of the total potential complex, but in no event shall the number of terminations be less than two (2) times during a twelve-month period. For example, a rental property with one hundred (100) rental units shall be deemed a problem property if there are six (6) or more utility account terminations for non-payment during a twelve-month period. 
(6)  If an account becomes delinquent due to non-payment on an account not in the owner's name, the owner of that property shall be notified of potential discontinuation of utility service in a timely manner. Tenants shall consent in writing to the city providing this notice to the property owner when the account becomes delinquent and to share the tenant's payment history to third parties upon request. 
(7)  A person providing an advanced security payment for a property not in their name shall provide the city with lease agreement documentation in order to establish proof of residency and the need for utility service in their name. 
(e)  Each multifamily rental property in the city will have a one-time minimum advanced security payment not assigned to any specific meter. Such minimum advanced security payment shall be reviewed periodically, and appropriate adjustments will be made in the amount required, but in no case will the minimum advanced security payment amount to less than one hundred dollars ($100.00). 
(f)  The rental property management will notify the city when they wish to have utilities provided to a vacant residential unit for cleaning purposes. The rental property management or owner will be billed for water and sewer used, but in no case will the amount be less than the minimum billing for one (1) month. 
(g)  Interest on advanced security payments will be calculated at the end of each month for all accounts with deposits on file. The interest rate shall be based on the average annual interest rate of return used by the state board of administration for the most recent twelve (12) months ending July 31st. The interest shall be calculated as simple interest and there will be no daily prorating of interest. During the September billing cycles the interest that has accrued through the end of August will be applied to customers' accounts in the form of a credit against the billing. When a customer account is final prior to the September billing and the security deposit is refunded, all calculated interest on the account, as provided above, shall be applied as a reduction on the final bill of the respective utility account. 
(h)  Residential properties located within the city limits that are not connected to the city's water supply system shall pay a minimum security deposit in the amount of forty dollars ($40.00) for stormwater utility fee and refuse collection.

Sec. 20-52. - Sewer charge. 
(a)  The rate, fee and charge for the use of and for the services and facilities furnished, or to be furnished, by the sewer system of the city, to be paid by the owner, tenant, or occupant of each lot or parcel of land which is connected with the sewer system, shall be based or computed upon the quantity of water used on or about such lot or parcel of land, as determined by the water meter reading. 
(b)  The base rate for consumptive charges for the use of the city sewer system for services within the city limits shall be established and amended by resolution adopted by the city council. 
The minimum monthly service charge shall be the service delivery charge plus the consumption charge for the first one thousand (1,000) gallons times the number of units. The service delivery charge for a nonresidential master meter account (meter serves more than one (1) unit) shall be computed at the five-eighths ( 5/8 ) by three-fourths (¾) inch meter size rate times the total number of units served. 
(c)  The increase or decrease in the charges for the consumption of sewer within the city's service area shall automatically pass-through to the customers on a cent-for-cent basis equal to the adjustment charged to the city by the City of Daytona Beach. The additional charge levied under this section shall be known as a pass-through charge. In determining whether a proposed increase is an increase to the base rate or a pass-through charge, the following definitions shall apply: 
Base rate charge shall be the rate established in the schedule above. 
Pass-through charge shall be equal to the amount of any increase or decrease in the contract rate for sewer charged to the city by the City of Daytona Beach pursuant to the contract providing for rendition of water and sewer treatment service between the City of Daytona Beach and the City of South Daytona, executed June 1, 1994, as amended. The pass-through charges shall be automatically billed to the customers on a cent-for-cent basis equal to the adjustment from Daytona Beach, which includes both the true-up to actual cost for the previous year and the projected rate from for the next year. The adjustment shall automatically occur on June 1, 2008 and automatically on the same date each year thereafter without action by the city council. Beginning June 1, 2008, the pass-through of the Daytona Beach adjustment shall be identified separately on each customer's bill and shall be adjusted annually based on the pass-through charge from Daytona Beach. Pass-through adjustments shall be rounded to the nearest cent. 
(d)  The city council hereby authorizes an annual adjustment to the sewer service delivery charge, the minimum charge for the first one thousand (1,000) gallons or part thereof and the consumption charges equal to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the Southeast Region For All Consumer Goods as published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics for the twelve (12) months ending on the March 31 prior to the effective date of the annual increase. The annual CPI increase will first go into effect on June 1, 2003 and shall be automatically adjusted annually on the same date without further action of the city council. 
(e)  In the event that the property having city sewer service is a rental or lease property, regardless of the number of units or whether the property is residential or commercial, and the city has had problems with delinquent accounts or nonpayment of utility bills, the city may require the owner of the property to pay the monthly utility bill. In the event that service is discontinued to a property for any reason, service shall not be restored to the property until all delinquent and current charges are paid except as required by F.S. § 180.135 (1988).

Sec. 20-70. - Bills for water and sewer services; delinquency; discontinuing service for nonpayment; service continuation charge; reconnect service charge; disconnect fee. 
(a)  Utility bills shall be rendered monthly, and no discount shall be allowed for prompt payment thereof. Payments will be applied first to public service tax and then to stormwater drainage fees, penalties, miscellaneous fees and garbage collection fees if such charges apply, then to sewer charges and lastly, to charges for water service. If payment on any bill is not received within twenty (20) days following the date of the bill, a late charge equal to ten per cent (10%) of the unpaid balance shall be added thereto. If payment on any bill is not received within twenty-nine (29) days of the bill date, service on the account shall be disconnected. 
(b)  In the event that service is scheduled to be disconnected for nonpayment of the customer's bill in accordance with subsection (a) above, service shall be continued or reconnected only after all delinquent and current charges on the account are paid, along with a service continuation charge of fifteen dollars ($15.00) and a reconnect charge of five dollars ($5.00) if service has actually been disconnected. 
(c)  In the event that service is disconnected for nonpayment of a bill for two (2) consecutive months, the reevaluated additional deposit calculated in accordance with subsection 20-32 (a)(1) shall be collected in addition to the above charges before service can be restored. 
(d)  In the event that service is disconnected for any reason, service shall not be restored to the property until all outstanding charges on the account are paid, except as required by F.S. § 180.135, as amended from time to time. If the city is requested to disconnect a customer's service temporarily, a disconnection fee of ten dollars ($10.00) will be added to the customer's first bill after reconnection to the city's water system, which shall also include a reconnection fee of ten dollars ($10.00) (a total of twenty dollars ($20.00)). 
(e)  When reconnection to the city's water system requires the installation of a meter, not withstanding the reason for which the service was previously disconnected, a service charge of twenty dollars ($20.00) for reconnection and installation of the meter shall be required. 
(f)  Any unpaid water and sewer utility fees shall constitute a lien against the property, when such fees are for an account in the name of the property owner, which lien shall be prior to all other liens on such property except the liens of the state, county and municipal taxes and shall be on a parity with the lien of such state, county and municipal taxes. Such lien when delinquent for more than thirty (30) days may be foreclosed by the city in the manner provided by the laws of the state for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property. 
(g)  Existing single family residence may finance the total cost of water and sewer impact fees and connection charges. The amount financed shall be amortized over a ten (10) year period of time at a rate of interest equal to the lower of the city's financing cost for that specific improvement or the city's prevailing yield on investments. The property owner shall, in writing, authorize the city to include the monthly payment as part of the monthly utility bill for water and sewer service and said monthly payment shall be deemed part of the monthly utility bill for all collection purposes, including but not limited to termination of utility service.

(1)  Water. If a water meter is proven to be inaccurate by testing, the average water consumption for the past month up to twelve (12) months shall be determined and an adjustment, based on that average, shall be made to the bill in question. 
(2)  Sewer. If it is proven that the water used did not enter the sewer system (i.e., an underground leak on the customer side of the meter, a broken water pipe within the residence, etc.), an adjustment will be made on the sewer portion of the bill in question, based on the previous twelve-month average water consumption. 
(3)  Swimming pools. An adjustment will be made on the sewer portion for filling of pools, provided the customer request either their meter be read prior to and after filling the pool, or they provide evidence of pool filling.

(e)  Baseline monitoring reports. Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or one hundred eighty (180) days after the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.1(a)(4), whichever is later, existing significant industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the municipal system shall be required to submit to the city a report which contains the information listed in subparagraphs section 20-114(e), (4) through (8) below. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, including existing users which have changed their operation or processes so as to become new sources, shall be required to submit to the city a report which contains the information listed in subparagraphs section 20-114 (c)(1) through (8). A new source shall also be required to report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. A new source shall also give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants discharged. 
The information required by this section includes: 
(1)  Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners. 
(2)  Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
(3)  Description of operations. The user shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operation(s) carried out by such industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the system from the regulation processes. 
(4)  Flow measurement. The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the system from regulated process streams and other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(5)  Measurement of pollutants. 
a.  The industrial user shall identify the categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
b.  In addition, the industrial user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (and/or mass, where required by the standard of city) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum and long term average concentrations (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be performed in accordance with procedures set out in 40 CFR Part 136. 
c.  Grab samples must be used for PH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. All other pollutants will be measured by composite samples obtained through flow proportional sampling techniques. If flow proportional composite sampling is feasible, samples may be obtained through the proportional sampling techniques or through four (4) grab samples if the user proves such a sample will be representative of the discharge. 
(6)  Special certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required in order to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(7)  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the shortest compliance schedule will be established by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in section 20-113 of this article. 
(8)  Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 20-113(c). 
(f)  Compliance deadline reports. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the municipal wastewater system, any industrial user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the city a report containing the information described in section 20-114 (e)(5) and (6). For industrial users subject equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 20-113(c). 
(g)  Periodic compliance reports. Any significant industrial user subject to the pretreatment standard shall, at a frequency determined by the director but in no case less than twice per year, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 20-113(c). 
(1)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(2)  In the event an industrial user's monitoring results indicates a violation has occurred, the industrial user must immediately notify the director and resample its discharge. The industrial user must report the results of the repeated sampling within thirty (30) days of discovering the first violation. 
(h)  Notice of changed conditions. Each industrial user is required to notify the director of any planned significant changes to the industrial user's operations or pretreatment systems which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater. 
(1)  The director may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, and may require the revision of a pretreatment agreement under section 20-113(a) if necessary. 
(2)  No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition(s) until and unless the director has responded to the industrial user's notice. 
(3)  For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of ten per cent (10%) or greater and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutant shall be deemed significant. 
(i)  Notice of potential problems. All categorical and noncategorical industrial users shall notify the director immediately of all discharges that could cause problems to the municipal wastewater system, including any slug loadings. Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental or intentional discharges of prohibited material or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent the discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. 
(1)  No industrial user which commences contribution to the system after the effective date of this article shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. 
(2)  In the case of an accidental or other discharge which may cause potential problems for the municipal wastewater system, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. This notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(3)  Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the system, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; no such notification shall relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article. 
(4)  Failure to notify the city of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this article. 
(j)  Reporting requirements for industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards. Those industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall report monitoring results specified in the pretreatment agreement at a frequency specified in the agreement. 
(k)  Recordkeeping. All industrial users subject to reporting requirements must retain any records of monitoring activities and results for a minimum of three (3) years. 
(Ord. No. 84-16, § 5, 7-24-84; Ord. No. 92-26, § 2, 1-12-93; Ord. No. 18-01 , § 2, 2-13-18)  
Sec. 20-115. - Right of refusal. 
The city reserves the right to revoke any agreement and to refuse waste from any lot or parcel of land upon which there is located any building or activity which does not comply with this article, utilize city water, supply proper metering of its waste, or is not within its designated service area. 
The city may immediately halt any discharge that is an imminent danger to the system or users of the system and seek injunctive relief or code enforcement board review. 
(Ordinance No. 84-16, § 6, 7-24-84; Ord. No. 92-26, § 2, 1-12-93)  
Sec. 20-116. - Special rates. 
(a)  A surcharge shall be imposed upon customers discharging abnormal strength wastes. The term "abnormal strength wastes" as used herein shall refer to the degree of concentration of permissible waste material per unit volume of sewage discharge by the customer. Abnormally high-strength waste shall be waste containing a BOD above three hundred (300) mg/l and/or suspended solids above three hundred (300) mg/l and/or a COD above four hundred (400) mg/l. 
(b)  Surcharge for high-strength wastes: 
(1)  A surcharge will be imposed where the wastes from any lot or parcel of land upon which there is located any institutional, commercial, or industrial plant building or premises containing an abnormally high BOD and/or suspended solids concentration and/or COD as defined in section 48-58(a). 
(2)  Computation: Said surcharge in dollars shall be computed by the director, or his designated agent, using the following formulas: 
Surcharge for BOD = (Q) (8.34) (BOD -300) (.9) (SF BOD) 
Surcharge for suspended solids = (Q) (8.34) (SS -300) (.9) (SF SS) 
Surcharge for COD = (Q) (8.34) (COD -400) (.9) (SF COD) 
Where: 
(a)  Q = The metered water used during the billing period in millions of gallons, divided by the number of days in that billing period. 
(b)  SF = Surcharge factor. 
(c)  It is understood that if the value for (BOD -300), (SS -300), or (COD -400) is less than or equal to zero (0) that respective surcharge shall equal zero (0) also. 
(3)  Surcharge factors: The surcharge factors shall be derived annually by the following formulas using total figures for the preceding fiscal year: 
a.  Surcharge factor for BOD = SF BOD = total operational cost of the sewage treatment plant divided by the total pounds of suspended solids removed. 
b.  Surcharge factor for suspended solids = SF SD = total operational cost of the sewage treatment plant divided by the total pounds of suspended solids removed. 
c.  Surcharge factor for COD = SF COD = total operational cost of the sewage treatment plant divided by the total pounds of COD removed. 
(c)  All users of the sewage system affected by the above-described surcharge shall be allowed ninety (90) days in which to comply with the provisions of this section. 
(d)  Nothing herein shall restrict the city from making additional adjustments in rates if it is felt by the public works director, or his authorized agent, that the nature or the quantity of this waste creates an additional burden on the system. 
(Ord. No. 84-16, § 7, 7-24-84)  
Sec. 20-117. - Penalties clause. 
Any person who violates any provision of this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days, or both fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court, for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day during which a violation occurs or continues. After a period of ten (10) days of continued violation, the wastewater services shall be terminated. Additionally and alternatively, the city may enforce this article by applying for civil relief, either in law or equity, for a declaration of rights, injunctive relief, or other appropriate remedies. Upon finding a violation, the court shall grant the relief it finds appropriate. It is the express intent hereof that the city not be required to plead and prove a public nuisance, intent or scienter as a basis for civil relief, and no bond shall be required. 
The provisions may also be enforced by the code enforcement board. Nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing more than one (1) penalty for the same offense.

ARTICLE VIII. - STORMWATER UTILITY FEE[8] 

Footnotes: 
--- (8) --- 
Editor's note— Nonamendatory Ord. No. 89-23, §§ 1—6, adopted Aug. 22, 1989, has been codified herein by the editor as Art. VIII, §§ 20-121—20-126. 
 
Sec. 20-121. - Definitions. 
For the purposes of this article, the following definitions shall apply; words used in the singular shall include the plural and the plural the singular; words used in the present tense shall include the future tense. The word shall is mandatory and not discretionary. The word may is permissive. Words not defined herein shall be construed to have the meaning given by common and ordinary use as defined in the latest edition of Webster's Dictionary: 
Actual retention volume (ARV), for any particular site it means the actual on-site retention storage volume in cubic feet plus one-half, if any, of the actual on-site wet detention treatment volume in cubic feet. 
Developed property means that which has been altered from its natural state by the addition of any improvements, such as a building, structure, impervious surface, change of grade or landscaping. 
For new construction, a property shall be considered developed pursuant to this article: 
(1)  Upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or upon completion of construction or final inspection if no such certificate is issued; or 
(2)  Where construction is at least fifty per cent (50%) complete, and construction is halted for a period of three (3) months. 
Director of finance means the director of the finance department or his designee. 
Equivalent residential unit (ERU) means the average impervious area of a single-family residential unit within the city. The value of one (1) ERU is hereby determined to be two thousand (2,000) square feet. 
Fee reduction multiplier (FRM) means the percentage factor which is multiplied by the gross stormwater utility fee to obtain the net stormwater utility fee which is chargeable to a nonresidential property due a stormwater fee credit. It is derived using the formula (1-SCR). 
Nonresidential property means any lot or parcel not exclusively residential as defined herein, including apartment buildings, condominiums, and transient rentals such as hotels and motels. 
Residential property means any lot or parcel developed exclusively for single-family residential purposes, including single-family homes, manufactured homes, and duplexes. 
Site contribution ratio (SCR), for any particular site it is the ARV divided by the SRV, usually expressed as a percentage. 
Standard retention volume (SRV), for any particular site it means the amount of on-site cubic feet of storage capacity required to hold one hundred per cent (100%) of the stormwater runoff generated from the impervious area by a twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour storm event. It is determined by taking the impervious area of the site in square feet, adding to it one-half (½) of the pervious parking area, if any, in square feet on the site, adding the two (2) items together and multiplying the result by .79 (which is a factor representing the amount of rainfall typically produced by a twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour storm event in the South Daytona area (9.5 inches, or .79 feet)). 
Stormwater system standard means the same thing as the term "standard retention volume." 
(Ord. No. 89-23, § 1, 8-22-89; Ord. No. 95-03, § 1, 3-28-95; Ord. No. 95-20, § 1, 12-12-95)  
Sec. 20-122. - Imposed. 
A stormwater utility fee is hereby imposed on all developed lots or parcels of land within the city. 
(Ord. No. 89-23, § 2, 8-22-89)  
Sec. 20-123. - Stormwater utility rate. 
(a)  The rate to be charged for one (1) ERU shall be as determined and established by resolution by the city council from time to time and kept on file in the office of the city clerk. 
(b)  The fee imposed for residential properties shall be the rate for one (1) ERU multiplied by the number of individual dwelling units existing on the property (ERU rate × the number of dwelling units). 
(c)  The fee imposed for nonresidential properties as defined herein shall be the rate for one (1) ERU multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total impervious area of a nonresidential property by the value of one (1) ERU (2,000) as follows: 
Fee = ERU rate × ( impervious area/2,000 ) 
The finance director shall be responsible for the determination of the impervious area based on data supplied by the county property appraiser or by the property owner, tenant or developer if such information is unavailable. The director may require additional information as necessary to make the determination. 
(d)  The minimum fee for any nonresidential parcel shall be equal to the rate for one (1) ERU. 
(e)  The owner of any developed nonresidential property may submit a written application to the finance director for a reduction (credit) in the corresponding stormwater utility fee, which reduction shall be determined according to the following criteria and procedures: 
(1)  Criteria. 
a.  Minimum threshold to qualify for credit: No credit (fee reduction) shall be allowed unless the site contribution ratio (SCR) exceeds 0.1 (ten per cent (10%)). 
b.  Maximum credit: No credit (fee reduction) shall exceed fifty per cent (50%) (one-half) of the unadjusted gross stormwater utility fee, even if the SCR exceeds 0.5. 
c.  Method to calculate the credit (fee reduction): 
1.  Determine the standard retention volume (SRV), as defined above, for the site. 
2.  Determine the actual retention volume (ARV), as defined above, for the site. 
3.  Divide the ARV by the SRV to obtain the site contribution ratio (SCR), as defined above—i.e. ARV/SRV = SCR. 
4.  Determine the fee reduction multiplier (FRM), as defined above—i.e. 1 minus the SCR. 
5.  Determine the unadjusted gross stormwater utility fee for the site by multiplying the number of ERU's times the stormwater utility rate. 
6.  Determine the net stormwater utility fee by multiplying the FRM by the unadjusted gross stormwater utility fee subject to the following limitations: (a) If the FRM does not exceed 0.1, no credit shall be given. (b) If the FRM exceeds 0.5, the FRM shall be deemed to be 0.5 for calculating the net fee. 
7.  Example of fee calculation for hypothetical site "X": 
(a)  Assume SRV = 16,000 cf (impervious area × 0.79). 
(b)  Assume ARV = 3,000 cf. 
(c)  Assuming 11 ERU's at $5.00/ERU/mo. gives an unadjusted gross stormwater utility fee of $55.00/mo. or $660.00/year. 
(d)  Then to determine the SCR, the ARV is divided by the SRV—i.e. ARV/SRV = SCR (3,000/16,000 = .1875). 
(e)  The FRM is then determined by 1-SCR—i.e. 1-.1875 = .8125. 
(f)  Finally, to determine the net stormwater utility fee, the unadjusted gross stormwater utility fee is multiplied by the FRM—i.e. $55.00 times .8125 = $44.69 (monthly) or $44.69 times 12 = $536.28 (yearly). 
8.  Example of fee calculation for hypothetical site "Y": 
(a)  Assume SRV = 348,000 cf (impervious area × 0.79). 
(b)  Assume ARV = 100,000 cf. 
(c)  Assuming 174 ERU's at $5.00/ERU/mo. gives an unadjusted gross stormwater utility fee of $870/mo. or $10,440/year. 
(d)  Then to determine the SCR, the ARV is divided by the SRV—i.e. ARV/SRV = SCR (100,000/348,000 = .2874). 
(e)  The FRM is then determined by 1-SCR—i.e. 1-.2874 = .7126. 
(f)  Finally, to determine the net stormwater utility fee, the unadjusted gross stormwater utility fee is multiplied by the FRM—i.e. $870 times .7126 = $620.47 (monthly) or $620.47 times 12 = $7,445.64 (yearly). 
9.  Example of fee calculation for hypothetical site "Z": 
(a)  Assume SRV = 156,000 cf. (impervious area × 0.79). 
(b)  Assume ARV = 15,000 cf. 
(c)  Assuming 74 ERU's at $5.00/ERU/mo. gives an unadjusted gross stormwater utility fee of $370/mo. or $4,440/year. 
(d)  Then to determine the SCR, the ARV is divided by the SRV—i.e. ARV/SRV = SCR (15,000/156,000 = 0.096). 
(e)  However, due to the fact that the SCR does not exceed 0.1, no credit shall be given. 
(2)  Procedure for obtaining reduction in fee. 
a.  The finance director shall notify all nonresidential property-owners of record of the city's "stormwater credit (fee reduction)" program, including a brief description of how it works. 
b.  The property-owner shall submit a formal written request to the finance director if he desires a credit for his property. The application fee for processing this request shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00), to be paid when the request is submitted to the city. 
c.  Community development department staff shall check the site development records of the city to determine whether they provide the data showing that the stormwater management system of the property was approved and built in accordance with the city's current standard. If the records show the affirmative and provide the necessary data to calculate the FRM factor, the finance director shall calculate the net stormwater utility fee and shall notify the applicant in writing, indicating the amount of the fee and how it was calculated, with no further proof being required of the applicant. In such case, the net stormwater utility fee for the property shall take effect as soon as practicable following the determination of the finance director. 
d.  However, if city records do not show the necessary data for the property, the finance director shall so determine, and he shall so advise the applicant in writing, indicating the data that the applicant must furnish to the city. In such case, the applicant shall bear the burden of proof to determine and provide to the satisfaction of the city the site contribution ratio (SCR) as set forth in this section. The required proof from the applicant must include documentary certification from a Florida registered professional engineer showing how the SCR was determined. Upon receipt of the required documentation, the city engineer shall examine it and determine whether or not the showing is acceptable to him. 
e.  If the showing of the applicant is verified by and acceptable to the city engineer, the city engineer shall so inform the finance director, who shall make the corresponding determination and so notify the applicant in writing, with no further proof being required of the applicant; in such case, the stormwater utility fee for the property shall be adjusted accordingly as soon as practicable following the determination of the finance director. However, if the applicant's showing is not acceptable to the city engineer, the city engineer shall provide the finance director with the written rationale behind his finding; in such case the finance director shall make a determination of unacceptability and shall so notify the applicant in writing stating the rationale supporting the determination. 
f.  Retrofit. Even after an initial determination by the city of the amount of credit for a particular property, at any time thereafter the property-owner has the option of improving the stormwater management system of the property and applying to the finance director for an additional credit by following the applicable procedures previously set forth herein. No retrofit credit shall be granted until such time as the improvements have been completed and determined to be functional and acceptable by the city engineer. 
(3)  Continuation of stormwater fee credit dependent upon proper maintenance of stormwater facilities. After a particular property receives a stormwater fee credit, annually thereafter the city shall inspect the site's stormwater facilities in order to determine whether those facilities are maintained and functioning properly. If the city inspection determines that they are maintained and functioning properly, the stormwater fee credit shall be continued. However, if the city inspection determines that they are improperly maintained and not functioning properly, the city shall notify the property-owner to correct the deficiency within sixty (60) days. If the deficiency is corrected to the satisfaction of the city within the sixty-day period, the stormwater fee credit shall continue in effect until the next annual inspection; however, if the deficiency is not corrected to the satisfaction of the city within sixty (60) days, the city may cancel the stormwater fee credit until the necessary corrections are made. 
(4)  Special deferred payment classification for nonresidential properties with impervious surface area of one million square feet or more. Any such property will be allowed to defer payment of up to fifty per cent (50%) of its normal stormwater facility fee obligation if the property-owner enters into a written agreement with the city which provides that the deferred portion of the fee obligation be set aside by the property-owner for the purpose of constructing stormwater facilities which will bring the stormwater management system of the property up to the city standard within five (5) years of the date of the agreement. The city shall relinquish any claim to those deferred payment funds which are actually used to upgrade the stormwater facility system on the site within the five-year period; however, any such funds that have not actually been expended for that purpose by the end of the five-year period shall immediately become due and payable to the city. 
(Ord. No. 89-23, § 3, 8-22-89; Ord. No. 95-03, §§ 2, 3, 3-28-95)  
Sec. 20-124. - Billings and payment; penalties. 
(a)  Bills or statements for the stormwater utility fee shall be rendered monthly in accordance with the regular utility billing cycle by the utility billing department for all properties subject to the fee. Bills shall be payable at the same time and in the same manner and subject to the same penalties as set forth in this chapter for water and sanitary sewer service. Any partial payment of a combined utility bill shall be applied first to the stormwater utility fee. Any unpaid stormwater utility fees shall constitute a lien against the property, which lien shall be prior to all other liens on such property except the liens of state, county and municipal taxes and shall be on a parity with the lien of such state, county and municipal taxes. Such lien when delinquent for more than thirty (30) days may be foreclosed by the city in the manner provided by the laws of Florida for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property. 
(b)  For properties normally receiving monthly utility bills for other services, the stormwater utility fee shall be included in the monthly utility bill rendered to the established customer. 
(c)  For properties not receiving monthly utility bills for other services, the bill or statement for the stormwater utility fee shall be sent to the owner of the property as determined from the tax rolls. The utility billing department may render annual or semiannual billing on such properties if determined to be in the best interest of the city. 
(d)  The owner of a property is ultimately responsible for all fees imposed under this article. 
(Ord. No. 89-23, § 4, 8-22-89)  
Sec. 20-125. - Request for adjustment. 
All requests for adjustment of the stormwater utility fee shall be submitted to the finance director. The director shall review each request as follows: 
(1)  All requests shall be in writing and set forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. 
(2)  Adjustment requests made during the first calendar year that the fee is imposed shall be reviewed by the director within a one-year period from the date of submission. Adjustments resulting from such requests shall be retroactive to the effective date of this article. 
(3)  All adjustment requests received after the first calendar year that the fee is imposed shall be reviewed by the director within a four-month period from the date of submission. Adjustments resulting from such requests shall be retroactive to the date of submission. 
(4)  The owner, tenant or occupant requesting the adjustment may be required at his own cost to provide supplemental information to the finance department, including but not limited to survey data and engineering reports approved by either a registered professional land surveyor (RPLS) or a professional engineer (PE). Failure to provide such information may result in the denial of the adjustment request. 
(5)  The director shall provide the person requesting the adjustment with a written determination of the request within the time provided herein. Any adjustments shall be prorated monthly. 
(Ord. No. 89-23, § 5, 8-22-89)  
Sec. 20-126. - Appeals. 
All determinations of the director pursuant to section 20-125 herein may be appealed to an appeals board consisting of the city manager, the community development director, the finance director and the public works director or their designees. Appeals must be filed in the office of the finance director within thirty (30) days of receipt of the director's written determination. Appeals shall be heard within thirty (30) days of filing. In evaluating appeals, the appeals board shall be bound by the method of setting rates as set forth in this article. The decision of the board shall be final.

Editor's note— Ordinance No. 94-02, adopted March 8, 1994, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, inclusion of §§ 1—5 as Ch. 20, Art. IX, §§ 20-131—20-135 was at the discretion of the editor. 
 
[DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY] 
 
Sec. 20-131. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this article is to protect the public potable water supply of South Daytona, Florida from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within the customer's internal distribution system(s) or the customer's private water system(s) such contaminants or pollutants that could backflow into the public water system. 
To provide for the elimination or control of existing cross connections, actual or potential, between the customer's in-plant potable water system(s) and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures, and industrial pipe systems. 
To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection control that will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems and will be in compliance with Florida Administrative Code 62-555.360.

[DIVISION 2. - CITY OF SOUTH DAYTONA'S CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL PLAN] 
 
Sec. 20-136. - Intent and purpose. 
A.  To protect the public drinking water supply of the City of South Daytona from the possibility of contamination by isolating the customer's internal distribution system to prevent backflow into the public water system; and, 
B.  To provide for the elimination or control of existing cross connections, actual or potential, between the customer's water system, plumbing fixtures, irrigation and industrial piping systems; and, 
C.  To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection control that will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all drinking water systems by: 
1.  Educating the public concerning the hazards associated with cross connections. 
2.  Discovering and controlling cross connections through a program of inspections, installation of appropriate control devices and testing of these devices as well as training field personnel to identify cross connections during routine work schedules. 
3.  Requiring at a minimum, control devices be installed at the property line of each customer served by reuse water and at those specific facilities with conditions referenced in section 20-139B. 
D.  The following Statement of Policy on Water Supply Matters adopted by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) is supported by the City of South Daytona and hereby incorporated into this plan: 
"The American Water Works Association recognizes that the Water Purveyor has a responsibility to provide its customers at the service connection with water that is safe under all foreseeable circumstances. Thus, in the exercise of this responsibility, the Water Purveyor must take reasonable precautions to protect the community distribution system from hazards originating on the premises of its Customers that may degrade the water in the community distribution system. 
"Cross connection control and plumbing inspections on premises of water Customers are regulatory in nature and should be handled through the rules, regulations and recommendations of the health authority and the plumbing code enforcement agencies having jurisdiction. The Water Purveyor, however, should be aware of any situation requiring inspections and/or re-inspection necessary to detect hazardous conditions resulting from cross connections. If, in the opinion of the Utility, effective measures consistent with the degree of hazard have not been taken by the regulatory agency, the Water Purveyor should take such measures as they may deem necessary to ensure that the community distribution system is protected from contamination. Such action would include the installation of a backflow prevention assembly, consistent with the degree of hazard at the service connection or discontinuance of the service. 
"In addition, customer use of water from the community distribution system for cooling or other purposes within the customer's system and later return of the water to the community distribution system is not acceptable and is opposed by the AWWA."

The costs and charges for reclaimed water are divided into three (3) categories: 
(1)  Impact fees. Impact fees are those costs associated with providing trunk and distribution mains to the point of delivery, up to but not including the connection. An impact fee of three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) will be charged per connection. 
(2)  Connection fees. Connection fees are those costs directly associated with connecting the customer's premises to the reclaimed water distribution system. Connection will require an inspection of the property and facilities as defined in the city's reclaimed water policies and regulations. A connection fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) will be charged per connection. This fee will include the costs to have the city install a control valve, and service box to the reclaimed water service line. 
(3)  Operation and maintenance costs. Operation and maintenance costs are the reclaimed water system's ongoing costs for labor, materials, electricity, and other expenses of the system. Charges for these ongoing costs will be made as a flat rate of fifteen dollars ($15.00) per month for unlimited service during the customer's designated time frame outlined in section 20-173. The property owner or customer will be billed for operation and maintenance costs even if no reuse water is actually used during the month. 
(Ord. No. 09-02, § 1, 2-24-09; Ord. No. 11-02, § 1, 3-8-11)  
Sec. 20-171. - Discontinuance of service by city. 
The city may discontinue reclaimed water service to any customer due to an infraction of the procedures and regulations set out in this article, nonpayment of bills, for tampering with any service, for plumbing cross connections with another water source, or for other reasons that are detrimental to the system. The city has the right to cease service until the condition is corrected and all costs due the city are paid.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 1.1. - Title. 
    These regulations shall be entitled the "Consolidated Land Development Regulations" or "Code" of the City of South Daytona and may be referred to herein as the "Code." 
A.  Authority. This Consolidated Land Development Code is enacted pursuant to the requirements and authority of Chapter 163, Part II, Florida Statutes (the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act), the City Charter, Chapter 166, Florida Statutes, and the residual home rule powers granted to municipalities under the Florida Constitution. 
Sec. 1.2. - Findings. 
A.  General findings. 
1.  Chapter 163, Part II, Florida Statutes, requires the city to enact a Consolidated Land Development Code which implements and is consistent with the local Comprehensive Plan, and which contains all land development regulations for the City of South Daytona. 
2.  Regulating the location, design and construction of development within the city is necessary to maintain and improve the quality of life in the city. 
B.  Relationship to comprehensive plan. It is the intention of the city council and local planning agency that this ordinance serve to implement the requirements of the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act, Chapter 163.3202 of the Florida Statutes, that requires the adoption of Land Development Regulations, and compliance with the requirements of the Florida Department of Community Affairs (DCA) Rule 9J-29, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.). These Land Development Regulations specifically address the following provisions: 
1.  The implementation of the regulations specifically stated in the adopted policies of the South Daytona Comprehensive Plan; 
2.  The regulation of signage; 
3.  The protection, preservation, or introduction of trees or other natural or planted flora and fauna; 
4.  The provision of safe and convenient on-site traffic flow, considering the need for vehicle parking and pedestrian movement; 
5.  The protection of potable water supply sources through the control of land uses and activities within the identified cones of influence and general areas of influence for the City of South Daytona's wells and wellfields; 
6.  The regulation of the areas subject to seasonal and periodic flooding and the provision of drainage and stormwater management through the control or use of construction techniques within these areas; 
7.  The protection of environmentally sensitive lands designated in the comprehensive plan, particularly the wetlands areas identified in the conservation element; 
8.  The regulation of the use of land and water for the use categories included in the South Daytona Comprehensive Plan as implemented by a set of zoning districts and a zoning map; 
9.  The provision of public facilities and services concurrent with the impacts of development based upon adopted levels of service (LOS); 
10.  The subdivision of land, including provisions that meet the statutory requirements of Chapter 177, Part I, F.S., including review procedures, design and development standards, provisions for adequate public facilities, mitigation of development impacts, land dedications, fees and administrative provisions; 
11.  In the event of a conflict between these regulations and the comprehensive plan, the comprehensive plan shall prevail. 
Sec. 1.3. - Specific findings relating to the various subject areas of this Code. 
    With regard to the following specific subject areas of this Code, the city council finds: 
A.  Administration and enforcement. 
1.  A single set of administrative procedures for making all land use decisions promotes efficiency, predictability, and citizen participation. 
2.  All development proposals should undergo a development review process to assure compliance with the requirements of this Code. 
B.  Signs. 
1.  The manner of erection, the location and the maintenance of signs affects the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the city. 
2.  The safety of motorists, cyclists, pedestrians and other users of the public streets is affected by the number, size, location, and appearance of signs that divert the attention of drivers. 
3.  The construction, erection and maintenance of large signs suspended from or placed on the tops of buildings, walls or other structures constitutes a direct danger to pedestrian and vehicular traffic, especially during periods of strong winds. 
4.  Uncontrolled placement and unlimited numbers of signs degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural and manmade attributes of the city thereby undermining the economic value of tourism, visitation and permanent economic growth. 
5.  Due to the city's predominate residential character, billboards, banners, and off-premises signs as defined in this Code are determined to have an adverse impact on the aesthetics of the city. It is determined that on-premises signs are generally sufficient to provide advertising for nonresidential uses within the city. 
C.  Landscaping and tree protection. 
1.  Landscaping and buffering of development with trees and other vegetation promotes the health, safety and welfare of the city sufficient to justify the imposition of landscaping and buffering requirements. 
2.  Trees and landscaping benefit the city by performing, among other functions, the following; 
a.  Absorbing carbon dioxide and returning oxygen to the atmosphere; 
b.  Precipitating dust and other particulates from the air; 
c.  Providing wildlife habitat, particularly for birds, which in turn help control insects; 
d.  Providing soil stabilization, which reduces erosion and mitigates the effect of flooding; 
e.  Providing shade which reduces energy consumption and glare, making outdoor areas more comfortable during the warm months; 
f.  Making developed property more attractive by adding a variety of color, shape and pattern of foliage, thus increasing community pride and the stability of neighborhoods; 
g.  Providing attractive buffering between incompatible land uses; and 
h.  Abating noise. 
3.  Native vegetation shall be promoted since it has adapted to local diseases, pests, soil and climate, and is generally more economical and desirable than exotic species which require more pesticide, fertilizer and water. 
4.  Because some trees are more beneficial than others, the public benefits of tree protection may be obtained without preserving each and every tree. 
5.  Mangrove trees are especially valuable in stabilizing, building and protecting the shoreline, providing for spawning and breeding grounds for marine organisms and other wildlife, and serving as the basis for most of the estuarine food chains, which are critical to a substantial majority of those species considered important from a recreational and/or commercial standpoint. 
D.  Traffic management. 
1.  Off-street parking and loading of vehicles promote the public safety and welfare by reducing traffic congestion. 
2.  Well-designed off-street parking and loading areas promote the safe and efficient storage, loading and circulation of vehicles. 
3.  Allowing the use of porous paving materials and unpaved parking areas, whenever practical to do so, aids the recharge of surficial aquifers, moderates the microclimate, and reduces the expense and hazards of controlling stormwater runoff. 
E.  Stormwater management. 
1.  Surface water runoff carries pollutants into receiving water bodies, degrading quality; 
2.  The increase in nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters, adversely affecting flora and fauna; 
3.  Improperly channeling water increases the velocity of runoff, thereby increasing erosion; 
4.  Construction requiring the alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation increases erosion; 
5.  Siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases their capacity to hold and transport water, interferes with navigation, and harms flora and fauna; 
6.  Changes in the elevation of land may create or aggravate drainage problems on adjacent land; 
7.  Impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of surface water runoff, allowing less water to percolate into the soil and thereby decreasing groundwater recharge; 
8.  Improperly managed surface water runoff increases the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, thereby destroying property and causing loss of life; 
9.  Improperly managed surface water runoff interferes with the maintenance of optimum salinity in estuarine areas; 
10.  Economic losses result from these adverse impacts on community waters; and 
11.  Future problems can be avoided if developers provide for drainage in accordance with this chapter. 
F.  Floodplain protection. 
1.  Flooding is a natural, recurring phenomenon in the city. 
2.  Naturally flood-prone lands serve the following important functions in the regional hydrologic cycle and ecological system: 
a.  They provide natural storage and conveyance of flood waters. 
b.  They facilitate groundwater recharge. 
c.  They provide temporary storage of surface waters that moderates flood elevations and the timing, velocity and rate of flood discharges. 
d.  They reduce erosion, and filter nutrients, sediments, and other pollutants from flood waters. 
e.  They export detritus and other food sources to open water bodies and are vital habitat for fish, birds, wildlife and native plant communities. 
3.  Naturally occurring flooding may provide recharge to groundwater and a basic source of flow to surface waters. 
4.  The uncontrolled development of flood-prone lands substantially degrades the health, safety and welfare of the community in the following ways: 
a.  The owners, residents, customers, guests, and employees occupying homes, businesses and other structures located in flood-prone areas are placed at unreasonable risk of personal injury and property damage. 
b.  Expensive and dangerous search, rescue and disaster relief operations may be necessary when developed properties are flooded. 
c.  Roads, public facilities, and utilities associated with development may be damaged by flooding at great expense to taxpayers and rate payers. 
d.  Flooding of developed properties may lead to demands that the city construct expensive and environmentally damaging projects to control flood waters. 
e.  Normally flood-free lands are placed at risk of flooding when flood waters on natural flood-prone areas are obstructed, diverted, displaced or channelized by development. 
f.  Water quality is degraded, the supply of fresh water to estuaries is disrupted, and habitat is lost. 
g.  Property values are lowered and economic activity is disrupted by damaging floods. 
G.  Protection of environmentally sensitive lands/resources. 
1.  Protection of environmentally sensitive lands described or mapped in the coastal management/conservation element of the comprehensive plan promotes the well being of the residents of the city. 
2.  Shorelines serve the following beneficial functions: 
a.  Land adjoining waters, which can generally be divided into submerged, transitional, and upland vegetation zones, provides essential habitat for many plant and animal species, including species that are endangered, threatened, or of special concern. 
b.  Submerged, transitional, and upland vegetation zones serve as effective buffers against noise and other human activities which may have adverse effects on aquatic-dependent wildlife. 
c.  Submerged, transitional, and upland vegetation zones help slow stormwater runoff flows and increase infiltration of water, nutrients, and other substances into the soil. 
d.  Submerged, transitional, and upland vegetation zones reduce predation by domestic pets on wetland and wetland dependent wildlife species. 
H.  Land and water use regulations. 
1.  The regulation of the nature, rate, location and timing of development shall be conducted in an orderly fashion, commensurate with state, county and local laws, the comprehensive plan, and other applicable regulatory measures. 
2.  Zoning and subdivision regulations are necessary means to assure proper development, division and use of parcels in the city. 
I.  Concurrency management. Services and facilities should function at an established standard as defined in the South Daytona Comprehensive Plan so as to promote the general safety and welfare of the community. 
J.  Subdivision. The regulation of the division of land through provisions that meet the statutory requirements of Chapter 177, Part I, F.S. are necessary to: create review procedures, provide design and development standards, provide for adequate public facilities, mitigate development impacts, govern land dedications, and set fees.

    All applications for site plans and subdivision plats which require LDRB approval shall be first reviewed by the development review committee (DRC) as defined in section 3.4(C). Upon recommendation of the DRC, the CDD shall schedule a public hearing before the board on each application. The board shall thereafter submit to the city council, through the CDD, a written recommendation which:

b.  Findings of fact which established compliance or noncompliance with applicable criteria and standards of this Code. 
c.  Reasons for conclusions to approve, conditionally approve or deny. 
J.  Criteria for review. The LDRB and city council, in their deliberations on matters of land development, shall make findings of fact based upon the following criteria: 
1.  That the use(s) of property is (are) consistent with the land development regulations and comprehensive plan. 
2.  That the use(s) is (are) compatible with the adjacent existing or planned uses. 
3.  That the use provides adequate ingress/egress, parking, open space, and other amenities for the benefit of the users. 
4.  That the use does not impair rights of other properties to light, air, sunlight, or other natural phenomena. 
5.  That the project meets or exceeds tests for concurrency management. 
    The LDRB and city council shall each make verbal and written findings based upon the above criteria, which shall be made a part of the written proceedings from each public hearing or meeting where the development issue was recommended or approved. 
K.  Actions on applications. Public hearings shall be noticed and conducted as referenced in section 3.1. 
1.  Action by the land development regulation board. The LDRB shall consider and make recommendation to the city council concerning each matter under its purview, and may approve, approve with conditions (if applicable) or deny the request during hearings open to the public. 
2.  Action by city council. Before taking such action as it may deem advisable, the city council shall consider the LDRB's recommendations on each proposed action. If no recommendation is received from the LDRB within 45 days after its first public hearing, the proposed amendment shall be deemed to have been approved by the LDRB. 
    Upon receipt of the LDRB's written recommendations, the city council shall, at a duly advertised meeting, approve, approve with conditions (as applicable), or disapprove the recommendations of the LDRB. In the event of denial of any zoning change by the city council, subsequent application may not be made for similar zoning on the same parcel of property for a period of one year from the date of the denial by the city council, unless specifically authorized by that body. 
(Ord. No. 06-01, § 1, 1-24-06; Ord. No. 08-02, § 2, 2-26-08) 
Sec. 3.3. - Board of adjustments and appeals. 
A.  Creation. The South Daytona Board of Adjustments and Appeals (BOAA) is hereby created and shall have such powers, duties, responsibilities, limitations, rules and membership as hereinafter set forth. 
B.  Powers and duties. The board of adjustments and appeals shall hear and decide: 
1.  Appeal of administrative orders: To hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of any provision of the Land Development Code. Such an appeal shall be made within 30 days after the order, requirement, decision, or determination is issued. The appeal shall be in the form prescribed by the rules of the board. 
In exercising its powers, the board may, upon appeal and in conformity with provisions of this ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this Code, and may make any necessary order, requirement, decision, or determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is made. 
2.  Variances: To authorize upon appeal such variance from the terms of this Code as will not be contrary to the public interest when, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the Code would result in unnecessary and undue hardship. 
In order to authorize any variance from the terms of this Code, the board must find that the following criteria are met: 
a.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district; 
b.  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; 
c.  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Code to other lands, buildings, or structures in the same zoning district; 
d.  That literal interpretation of the provisions of the Code would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the terms of this Code and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant; 
e.  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure; 
f.  That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the Code and that such variance will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise be detrimental to the public welfare. 
In granting a variance, the board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this article and any code enacted under its authority. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Code. The board may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall begin or be completed or both. However, unless otherwise prescribed by the board, a variance for which construction has not commenced pursuant thereto within 365 days of its issuance shall become void unless extended or re-approved by the board. Lapse of a variance by the passage of time shall not preclude subsequent application for variance. 
Under no circumstances shall the board grant a variance to permit a use not generally or by special conditions permitted in the zoning district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this Code in the zoning district. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district, and no permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district, and no permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other zoning districts shall be considered grounds for the authorization of a variance. 
3.  Variances of flood hazard requirements. 
a.  Upon the submission of a written application to the BOAA, a variance may be granted permitting the erection of structures with a lowest flood elevation, including basement, lower than regulatory flood elevation if all of the following criteria are met: 
[1]  The property on which the structure is to be erected is an isolated lot of one-half acre or less, contiguous to and surrounded by existing structures constructed below such required first floor elevation, or the property is a structure to be restored or reconstructed and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places; 
[2]  Good and sufficient cause exists for the granting of the variance; 
[3]  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
[4]  The issuance of the variance would not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense; 
[5]  The variance allowed is the minimum necessary to afford relief; 
[6]  The variance would not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purposes of this article. 
b.  All applications for variances shall be heard by the board after reference to such committees and administrative officials as may be established for purposes of investigation and recommendation. 
c.  Prior to the granting of a variance, the board must find that justification exists in accordance with the terms of this article. These findings, together with the grant of a variance, shall be reduced to writing and made a part of the municipal records. Any variance shall pertain to the particular parcel of land and apply only to the proposed structure set forth in the variance application. 
d.  Any variance shall be freely transferable with the land and shall not be personal to the applicant. 
e.  Unless otherwise provided therein, a variance shall be valid for a period of one year after the date of its issuance. If construction has not commenced pursuant thereto within such time, said variance shall become void. Lapse of a variance by the passage of time shall not preclude subsequent application for variance. 
f.  No variance except as herein specifically permitted may be granted from the provisions of this article. The variance procedures herein provided shall be the exclusive method for obtaining variances under the provisions herein. 
g.  Each written application for a variance shall be accompanied by the applicable application fee and shall reflect the type of structure(s) for which a variance is sought, the size of such structures, the approximate location upon the parcel and the intended use thereof. 
h.  Due to the extremely hazardous conditions within the floodway and the effect of obstructions on upstream structures, no variance shall be issued within the designated floodway which results in any increase in flood levels during the regulatory flood discharge. 
4.  Evaluation of request for accommodation under the Fair Housing Act. 
a.  A request may be made by the property owner or authorized representative for a request for an accommodation from the city's rules, policy, practices or service to allow a handicapped person or persons to have equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. The request shall be on an approved form issued by the city and must contain the following: 
[1]  Proof of ownership of the property which the request is being made or authorization from the property owner. 
[2]  Specifically identify the rules, policies, practices or services from which relief is being requested. 
[3]  Identify the nature of the disability of the occupants of the dwelling. 
[4]  Outline the minimum relief that is necessary to allow a handicapped person to use and enjoy the dwelling. 
[5]  Describe in detail how the requested relief is necessary to allow a person with the above-identified disability to be able to reasonably use and enjoy the dwelling. 
[6]  Access must be granted to the necessary city employees to inspect the dwelling. 
b.  The city shall evaluate all necessary criteria, facts, rules, laws, etc., to make a determination as to whether the requested accommodation is reasonable, including but not limited to: 
[1]  The policies and objectives of the city's comprehensive plan including the future land use designation of the property in question. 
[2]  The permitted uses, conditional uses and special exceptions allowed for the zoning designation of the property in question. 
[3]  The surrounding neighborhood, including zoning and future land use designations of the surrounding area. 
[4]  The capacity of existing city utilities and infrastructures to accommodate the requested use. 
[5]  Existing traffic patterns and traffic problems in the area that currently exist or may become a problem if the requested relief was granted. 
[6]  Potential for noise, dust or other impacts to the neighborhood. 
[7]  Ability of the existing dwelling to accommodate the requested variation, including bedrooms, bathrooms, outside parking and existing compliance with current building codes to determine the existence of any life and safety issues. 
[8]  The existence of any current code violations. 
C.  An appeal stays all work. An appeal to the BOAA stays all work on the premises unless the chief building official certifies that by reason of fact stated in the certificate a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings or work shall not be stayed except by a restraining order which may be granted by the city council or by a court of record on application. 
D.  Hearings/fees. The BOAA shall hear the appeals at their next regularly scheduled meeting, or the chairman may call a special meeting if arranged. At the hearing, the applicant shall appear in person, or be represented by authorized agent or attorney. The appellant may be required to assume such reasonable costs in connection with such hearing(s) as may be prescribed by city council resolution. 
E.  Review of decisions of the board of adjustments and appeals. Any person affected by any decision of the BOAA, who wishes to appeal that decision may seek judicial review as provided by Florida Statutes. Such appeal must be filed within 30 days from the date of action taken by the BOAA. 
F.  Composition. The BOAA shall consist of seven members. Members of the board shall be appointed by the city council. In addition, the city council may appoint two alternate members, designating them as such. Such alternate members may act in the temporary absence or disability of any regular member, or may act when a regular member is otherwise disqualified in a particular case that may be presented to the board. No member of the board shall be a paid or elected official or employee of the city. To the extent possible the board shall be composed of one architect, one engineer, two general contractors with combined expertise of the above members in building, plumbing, electrical, fire safety and mechanical construction standards, and one member of the public. To the extent possible each member shall be a resident of the City of South Daytona. 
G.  Terms of office, removal from office, vacancies. Members of the board shall serve for overlapping terms of three years or thereafter until their successors are appointed. Not more than three of the terms of such members shall expire in any one year. Alternate members shall serve a term of one year. All members shall serve at the pleasure of the city council and may be removed without cause. A member shall immediately forfeit appointment if (s)he:

H.  Officers, rules of procedure. Employees and salaries. The board shall elect a chairman and a vice chairman from among its members and shall appoint a secretary who may be an officer or employee of the city. The board may create and fill such other offices as it may determine to be necessary for the conduct of its duties. Terms of all such offices shall be for one year, with eligibility for re-election.

If a final plan is not submitted within six months, the process may start over at the discretion of the director. 
3.  Should the applicant choose to submit a preliminary plan, the director, or designee, will verify compliance with submittal requirements, and within 30 days, schedule a meeting of the DRC to review and make a recommendation on the development plan. If the DRC has recommended approval or approval with conditions, the director will advise the applicant in writing of the actions taken, and the applicant may proceed with preparation of the final development plans.

Prior to construction of any regulated sign under this Code, plans and permits must be obtained as prescribed herein. 

F.  Time-frame for approvals. 
1.  After approval of the concept plan by the city, the developer must submit the final development plan within 24 months and obtain approval from the city of the final development plan within 30 months of concept plan approval. A new concurrency evaluation may be required, at the request of the director, if it appears that conditions have substantially changed to warrant reconsideration of concurrency matters. The determination to request a new concurrency evaluation, including the determination that there has been a substantial change to warrant reconsideration, shall lie solely in the discretion of the director, with concurrence of the city manager. For Planned Unit Development (PUD) or Planned Commercial Development (PCD) zoning designations, the approval of the rezoning ordinance to PUD or PCD zoning designation, including an attached master development agreement and concept plan, shall constitute the approval of the concept plan herein thereby starting the time period for submission and approval of the final development plan. 
2.  If construction has not commenced within one year of final development plan approval, the city council may grant a six-month extension of the plan, and, if subsequently determined necessary by the city council, additional six-month extensions, upon consideration of appropriate documentation demonstrating justifiable cause for the construction delay. Lot clearing and grading, road construction, drainage improvements and landscaping shall not constitute commencement of development activity for purposes of this section, except in the case of a residential subdivision. At the time the project is to commence, the city reserves the right to activate concurrency review if conditions warrant. The determination to request a new concurrency evaluation shall lie solely within the discretion of the director, with concurrence of the city manager. 
G.  Changes to approved site plans. Any major or substantial change in an approved or final plan which affects the intent and character of the development, land use pattern, the location or dimensions of major streets, or similar substantial changes, shall be reviewed and approved by the staff development review committee (DRC). Minor changes which do not affect the intent or character of the development may be approved by the director, with concurrence of the city manager, who will report such changes to the city council. Major or substantial changes to plans which require LDRB and city council approval shall be reviewed by the LDRB after recommendation from the DRC, with subsequent referral to the city council for final action. Major or substantial changes may require submittal of a new concurrency evaluation to assure compliance with level-of-service standards as adopted by the city. 
H.  Project phasing. For projects which are to be developed in phases a concept plan for all phases is required. In addition to any other requirements, the plan shall show all areas to be developed, with phases identified. The final development plan shall clearly indicate all phases, with the general location or types of development to be included in each phase. Prior to the issuance of building permits for subsequent phases, concept and final development plans shall be submitted and approved as stated herein. The city reserves the right to require a master development agreement to bind all parties for the term of the project or agreement, whichever is greater. 
I.  Effective period of a plan. A development or separately approved phase of development must be completed within three years of approval of the final development plan for the development or phase. The city manager may approve up to a 12-month extension to the completion date as long as the development is proceeding towards completion in good faith. If the development is not completed within the time period set forth above, including any extension approved by the city manager, the matter shall be presented to the city council, which may grant additional time to complete the project. Failure to complete the development within the time period set forth above, including all extensions approved by the city manager and/or city council, shall cause a forfeiture of the right to proceed under the development plan and require re-initiation of the application, concurrency evaluations, payment of additional fees and compliance with current regulations. For purposes of this section, a development is deemed complete when all certificates of occupancy have been approved for the entire development, including all phases. 
(Ord. No. 07-04, § 1, 4-10-07) 
Sec. 3.7. - Subdivision. 
A.  Intent. The approval of a subdivision is a legislative process involving city staff, LDRB and city council review. The intent of this section is to ensure that adequate and necessary physical improvements of lasting quality will be installed; to provide for safe and convenient traffic circulation; to provide an efficient, adequate and economic supply of utilities and services to new land developments; to prevent seasonal flooding through provisions of protective flood control and drainage facilities; to help conserve and protect physical, environmental and scenic resources; to promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare; and to implement the city's comprehensive plan. 
B.  Minimum requirements/application and approval. The process for application and specific requirements and exhibits for a subdivision are contained in Article VI of these regulations. Every subdivision of land within the city shall include the requirements contained in these regulations. Such requirements include submittal of plans, Section 6.3. The requirements contained within these sections shall constitute the minimum requirements and no omissions shall be permitted. A general development agreement may be required by the city to bind the parties. 
Sec. 3.8. - Zoning permits. 
A.  Issuance of zoning approval. Before any development plans are submitted, or prior to any development permit for which a development plan is not required to be issued, or before any development is undertaken for which a development permit is not required, an authorization of zoning must be issued. Such authorization may be given by the director, or designee, and must indicate that the proposed use, structure, lot, or appurtenance is permitted under the zoning regulations of this code. Issuance of a local business tax receipt will serve as prima facia evidence that the use is allowed, but other actions will require a certificate of zoning conformance. Approval of the zoning certificate will expire upon termination, abandonment for six months, or change in use of the lot or structure. Revocation by the city for cause is allowed if any of the requirements for each zoning district is violated. If revoked, the owner has 90 days to bring the property or violation into compliance with the Code. 
(Ord. No. 07-03, § 1, 2-13-07) 
Sec. 3.9. - Special exceptions/use permits. 
    In addition to the permitted uses specified in each zoning classification, there are also additional uses specified in each district which may be considered subject to the specific restrictions and conditions specified in this Code. These special uses shall be reviewed pursuant to the general standards specified therein. All special exceptions/uses shall be clearly marked on the official zoning map at the time of approval by the city council. 
Sec. 3.10. - Building permits. 
    The department is responsible for creation of the necessary forms to assure that the proposed construction drawings, methods, and management at construction-sites is done in conformance with local, county, and state building and safety practices. Through Ordinance Number 10-9 the City has adopted the 2007 edition of the Florida Building Code and future editions, adopted the 2007 edition of the Building Officials Association of Florida Model Administrative Code for the 2007 Florida Building Code and future editions, adopted the 2009 edition of the International Property Maintenance Code and International Fire Code and future editions as published by the International Code Council which will serve as the basic minimum criteria for a building permit to be issued. 
    Internal procedures will be established by the director who along with the chief building official is responsible for the administration of this Code and the building codes. The chief building official will be responsible for reviewing plans, issuing permits, and conducting inspections on-site to assure that the building is being constructed in conformance with the plans and permits. In the absence of the chief building official, the director will have the authority to issue permits and cause the inspections, seek remedial action for violations, and stop work that is not in compliance with established codes. Upon an approved final inspection, the chief building official, or director, may issue a certificate of occupancy, which authorizes the legal occupancy of the structure. In the event of business location or relocation, a local business tax receipt is also required. 
(Ord. No. 07-03, § 1, 2-13-07; Ord. No. 11-04, § 3.10, 4-26-11) 
Sec. 3.11. - Other permits required for development. 
A.  Internal (city) permits. Application forms currently in use are listed below. One application for all building permits is available from the city. 
1.  Building permit application. 
2.  Building permit receipt. 
3.  General complaint form. 
4.  LDRB and BOAA application. 
5.  Building inspection form. 
6.  Property inspection report. 
7.  Certificate of registration form. 
B.  External (non-city) permits. 
1.  Septic tank permit: These are issued by the Volusia County Health Department for all locations not on central sewer. South Daytona requires a county-approved septic tank permit, if applicable, prior to issuing a building permit, and a city final inspection approval prior to issuing a certificate of occupancy. 
2.  SJRWMD: This permit is required for drainage improvements associated with new construction prior to issuance of a building permit. As-built surveys for approval by the city are required. 
3.  FDEP: DEP permits are required for dock and seawall construction, and an approval is required prior to issuance of municipal building permit. DEP permits are also required for additions to our water and sewer systems. New subdivisions must have these permits prior to local approval to construct. 
4.  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: These permits are also required for dock and seawall construction. Review and approval by the city is required prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
5.  Traffic impact fee: A receipt showing payment of the county impact fee is required before issuance of a certificate of occupancy. The fee can also apply to existing structures where a change of use is involved. When there is a question on an existing building, the applicant is required (usually for a local business tax receipt) to produce a receipt or a statement that the fee does not apply. 
6.  Wetlands permit: This is a Volusia County requirement for any construction in the designated wetlands area. Typically this permit will be required for dock or seawall construction. 
7.  Hazardous wastes: Volusia County also regulates hazardous waste sources. Copies of County permits issued shall be attached to the city permit for building construction or the city local business tax receipt. 
8.  HRS: HRS certification for items such as nursing homes, day care centers and ACLF's is required to be shown at the time of issuance of a local business tax receipt. 
9.  Daytona Beach: By contract, an extension of the South Daytona water and sewer service area must be approved by Daytona Beach. 
10.  State of Florida - Department of Business and Professional Regulation: Restaurant inspections. 
11.  State of Florida - Division of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms: Alcohol permits. 
(Ord. No. 07-03, § 1, 2-13-07) 
Sec. 3.12. - Compliance with Volusia County minimum performance standards. 
    Volusia County has adopted a series of minimum performance standards which the municipalities are required to adopt within their own jurisdictions. The city may adopt new standards or revise existing permits from time to time. Any permits currently or subsequently adopted by the city are hereby incorporated herein and apply whether or not specifically referenced. Those adopted by the city are incorporated by reference and are applicable. Any standards adopted or amended will also be incorporated herein. 
Sec. 3.13. - Non-conforming provisions. 
A.  Types of non-conforming status. Within the districts established by this Code, or amendments that may later be adopted, there may exist: 
    Lots, uses of land, or structures which lawfully existed before this Code was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Code. 
    It is the intent of this Code to permit these nonconformities to continue in their present condition but not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
B.  Non-conforming lots of record. Where two or more adjacent nonconforming lots are under the same ownership, or where a nonconforming lot is adjacent to a conforming lot under the same ownership, such lot or lots shall be combined to form a single lot in compliance, or as close thereto as possible, with the then existing regulations if such joinder will result in a lessening of the nonconformity. 
    As long as the above provision is complied with when applicable, in any single-family residential district, notwithstanding district lot width or area requirements, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record as defined herein which existed at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the Code. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements applying to area or width, or both, of the lot as long as said lot conforms to all other regulations for district in which such lot is located. On non-conforming lots of record zoned commercial or industrial on the effective date of this ordinance, one commercial or industrial building shall be permitted provided that no adjoining lots are in the same ownership, or were in the same ownership at the effective date of this ordinance. 
    No portion of any non-conforming lot shall be sold or used in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this Code, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot width or area below the requirements statements stated in this Code. 
C.  Non-conforming uses of land and structures. The use of any building or structure not in conformance with these regulations pertaining to uses permitted on the effective date of this ordinance may not be: 
1.  Changed to another non-conforming use. 
2.  Re-established after discontinuance for six months. 
3.  Extended, enlarged, or expanded. 
4.  Rebuilt, or repaired after damage exceeding 50 percent of its assessed value as determined by the Property Appraiser of Volusia County, Florida, immediately prior to the damage. 
D.  Non-conforming structures. All conforming structures as of the date of this Code which might otherwise be rendered non-conforming shall be deemed to be non-conforming under this Code, and future development or expansion of these existing structures shall be regulated by dimensional requirements of this Code. 
    A non-conforming structure existing prior to the adoption of this Code shall continue to have such non-conforming status and shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this Code, including the following, which shall apply so long as the use of land or structure remains otherwise lawful: 
1.  No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its non-conformity. 
2.  Should such non-conforming structure or non-conforming portion of structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its current assessed value as recorded in the Volusia County Property Appraiser's office at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Code. 
3.  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after it is removed. 
E.  Non-conforming mobile home uses and structures. 
1.  In a mobile home park or a mobile home subdivision which constitutes a non-conforming use or contains non-conforming structures and the non-conformity cannot be completely corrected, a mobile home may be replaced if the replacement mobile home complies with the current front, side and rear yard setbacks as required for the intended location or, if it cannot meet the setback requirements, the replacement mobile home is equipped with an automatic fire sprinkler system sufficient to meet city standards. 
2.  The city shall waive the plumbing and electrical permit fees for any individual who elects to have the replacement mobile home equipped with an automatic fire sprinkler system as set forth in paragraph (1) above. 
3.  A mobile home which constitutes a non-conforming use that is located on property other than in a mobile home park or mobile home subdivision cannot be replaced once the mobile home is removed from its location. 
4.  Except as specifically provided in this section, mobile home parks and mobile home subdivisions which are either non-conforming uses or contain non-conforming structures shall be governed by the regulations and restrictions as set forth in the non-conforming provisions of the land development code or as set forth by statutory or case law. 
F.  Repairs and maintenance. On any non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-conforming use, repairs and modernization are permitted provided that the cubic area existing when it became non-conforming shall not be increased. Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any public official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
G.  Abandonment of non-conforming uses of land or structures. If a non-conforming use of land or a non-conforming use of structure has been abandoned for a period of 180 consecutive days, such use shall not thereafter be re-established and any future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Code. 
H.  All appurtenances, including but not limited to curb/gutter, roadways, utilities, stormwater management features, etc., shall be brought into conformance upon conversion, maintenance or improvement valued at 50 percent of the value of the appurtenance. 
I.  Uses under special exception or special use provisions are not non-conforming uses. Any use which is permitted as a special exception or special (conditional) use in a district under the terms of this Code shall be deemed a conforming use, subject to any conditions legally imposed by the city council in the past. 
J.  Non-conforming uses/structures in flood hazard areas. A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or amendment of this article but which is not in conformity with its provisions may be continued as a non-conforming use subject to the following conditions: 
1.  Any substantial improvement of a non-conforming structure shall be made in compliance with the provisions of this Code. 
2.  If such use is discontinued for 90 consecutive days, any future use of the building premises shall conform to this Code. 
3.  If any non-conforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including floods, to an extent of 50 percent or more of its assessed value immediately prior to the destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Code. 
4.  The value of all improvements, modifications, additions, and reconstruction to any existing building in the flood hazard area shall be recorded and counted cumulatively for ten years from the first date of such action. When the cumulative total value of such improvements exceeds 50 percent of the assessed value of such building, it shall be brought up to the code requirements for new buildings. 
K.  Conversions to condominiums. It is hereby declared that the conversion of an apartment, hotel or motel into a condominium shall constitute a change in use and as such the grandfathered status of all nonconformities shall terminate. 
(Ord. No. 97-23, § 1, 12-9-97; Ord. No. 05-23, § 1, 7-12-05; Ord. No. 06-12, § 1, 6-13-06) 
Sec. 3.14. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 07-16, § 1, adopted August 28, 2007, repealed § 3.14, which pertained to general development agreements. See also the Land Development Code Comparative Table. 
ARTICLE IV. - CONSISTENCY AND CONCURRENCY 

Sec. 4.1. - Consistency. 
    This Code and all development constructed subsequent to the adoption of the comprehensive plan must be consistent with the plan. To that end, this section of the Code establishes consistency requirements. 
A.  Consistency of land development regulations. It is hereby determined and declared that the provisions of this Code implement the goals, objectives and policies of the South Daytona Comprehensive Plan. 
B.  Development consistent with Code. After adoption of the South Daytona Comprehensive Plan, all developments approved thereafter must be consistent with the plan. In addition, development must conform with the terms and conditions outlined in this Code. 
1.  Consistency checklist. As a prerequisite to the issuance of a development order/permit under this Code, the director shall be responsible for reviewing and approving a consistency checklist to determine whether or not the proposed order/permit and development activity is consistent with the comprehensive plan and this Code. The checklist may be made prior to the submission or at the time of submission of an application for development permit. 
2.  Procedure if inconsistent. If it is determined that the proposed development order would result in an inconsistency with the Comprehensive Plan and Code the following actions may occur: 
a.  The director may approve the proposed development with conditions necessary to bring the application/request into conformance with the plan and Code; or 
b.  The director may initiate an amendment, pursuant to this Code, in order to facilitate a determination of consistency for a development permit, when it is found that such amendment would not affect the intent, character, and public interest as determined by the Comprehensive Plan or this Code. 
Sec. 4.2. - Concurrency management system. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the concurrency management system (CMS) described herein is to enable the city to comply with section 163.3202 (g) of the "Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act," Chapter 163, Part II, F.S., which requires: "that the city implement local land development regulations which provide that public facilities and services meet or exceed the standards established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan and are available when needed to meet the impacts of development, and that not later than one year after the official due date of the city's comprehensive plan, the city shall not issue a development order or permit resulting in a reduction in the level-of-service (LOS) for affected public facilities below the level-of-service adopted by the comprehensive plan. The city also intends that the CMS be consistent with Rule 9J-5.0055 F.A.C. which provides guidelines to local governments for the preparation and implementation of a CMS which will ensure the availability of public facilities and services concurrent with the impacts of development. To ensure that facilities and services needed to support development are available concurrent with the impacts of such development, a local government must adopt a concurrency management system." 
    The city's concurrency management system shall measure the potential impact of any proposed development upon the levels-of-service for potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, parks and recreation, drainage, and roadways by comparing that impact with available capacity and the city's adopted level-of-service standards for those public facilities. No final development permit shall be approved unless the city has determined, through the use of this mechanism, that adequate public facilities will be available at the time of project impact. 
B.  Intent. The city intends that the CMS be functionally compatible with the city's character as an already substantially built-out municipality, with virtually no potential for urban sprawl, within a surrounding urban core. This means that virtually all new development may be characterized as "in-fill," and its impact on facility levels-of-service should be relatively minor. 
    The city intends that the concurrency management system provide the basic principles and guidelines for its implementation. However, it is not the intent of the city that the ordinance contain all of the detailed administrative procedures required for the day-to-day operation of the program. Instead, the city desires that city officials responsible for the CMS possess a certain degree of flexibility and latitude to develop and employ such additional procedures, forms, etc. as they deem necessary for carrying out an effective and efficient concurrency management system. The city manager may develop as an administrative policy a concurrency manual or guide to assist city officials in the day-to-day administration of the program; such a document would provide more detail than the ordinance concerning administrative procedures. 
    It is not the intent of the city that the concurrency management system in any of its aspects, including concurrency evaluation and the issuance of concurrency compliance determinations, replace any other development review criteria used by the city, unless those criteria are inconsistent with the provisions of the concurrency management ordinance. The CMS is designed to primarily complement and not to replace the other review criteria. 
C.  Basic principles. 
1.  The CMS will formally take effect on the date specified in the adopting ordinance. 
2.  Each year in September, the city shall verify by capacity reservation certifications from the following provider entities for the public facilities indicated: City of Daytona Beach-potable water and sanitary sewer; Volusia County-solid waste. These statements shall cover at least the fiscal year starting October 1, and the five-year period starting with that fiscal year. 
3.  Each year in September, the city shall issue its own capacity reservation certifications to cover the succeeding fiscal year and the following four fiscal years (a total of five fiscal years) for the following public facilities: roadways, parks and recreation. 
4.  Each year in September, the city shall issue its own drainage certification to cover the succeeding fiscal year and the following four fiscal years (a total of five fiscal years) to cover on-site drainage facilities. 
5.  Concurrency review for a specific project will begin at the time of application for development approval. A determination of concurrency will be made at the time the application is submitted. Once capacity has been determined to be available, this capacity will be reserved and ultimately a capacity award will be made based on the Table 1 presented in Section C.7. 
6.  For each development application a concurrency compliance review form (CCRF) shall be completed, processed and filed (See Figure 4.) 
7.  The concurrency compliance review form establishes the service capacity reserved for that project. This capacity is reserved for the time period shown on the following chart. When a final development order is issued, this reservation shall be awarded through the issuance of a concurrency compliance certification. This certification shall remain valid for the time period shown on the following chart. If a capacity reservation cannot be made for one or more critical facilities, a concurrency compliance certification shall not be issued for the project. For those projects requiring several approvals, the reservation of capacity may occur at a different time than the final award of capacity.

8.  Impacts of phased projects shall be evaluated based on the phased development schedule. Capacity reservations and approvals may only be given for those phases occurring within the capital facilities horizon, and capacity awards may only be given as set forth in Section C.7 above. 
D.  Criteria for concurrency evaluation of public facilities. The following criteria will be used in conjunction with the concurrency compliance review form to evaluate the impact of proposed projects on public facilities. It should be noted, however, that for selected public facilities-i.e. potable water, sanitary sewer, and solid waste-overall city-wide demand (needed capacity) will be calculated based upon population estimates and projections generated annually by the Bureau of Economic and Business Research of the University of Florida (BEBR). This calculation will be done once per year (in September) by multiplying the given population level for a particular target year by the adopted level-of-service standard (a per capita figure); then the city-wide demand will be compared with the reserved capacity allocated by the provider for the period in question; if the city-wide demand is less than the available capacity, there shall be no adverse impact on the LOSS-i.e. there shall be no concurrency problem or deficiency. Even in these cases, however, project-by-project impact shall be calculated, evaluated, recorded and tracked to assure that the actual cumulative demand/impact does not exceed the available capacity for any relevant time period; the use of the CCRF form is essential for this process. 
1.  Roadway facilities. 
a.  Roadway capacity will be evaluated using the Florida Highway System Plan Level-of-Service Standards and Guidelines issued by FDOT and effective Jan. 1, 1989 (and as subsequently modified). Traffic modeling, when required, shall use the FSUTMS model. 
b.  Properties serviced by local roadways located within a recorded subdivision plat will be evaluated for impact at the nearest point of ingress/egress to the roadway network. 
c.  The impact on the roadway system will be determined by using the trip-generation standards contained in the VOLUSIA COUNTY IMPACT FEE ORDINANCE #86-6, as amended. The estimated trips generated by the proposed project will be subtracted cumulatively from the available capacity on the roadway to determine whether roadway capacity is adequate to support the project based upon the resultant LOS in comparison with the city's adopted LOSS for the roadway in question. 
d.  If no official traffic count exists for a collector or arterial, the city will provide the count within a reasonable period, unless it is arranged for by the applicant. If the city provides the count, the cost may be passed on to the applicant. 
e.  Calculation of total traffic to be generated by a proposed project will assume 100 percent build-out and occupancy. Credits against the trips generated by non-residential land uses will be applied using the percentages employed by the Volusia County Impact Fee System. Any claimed credit for capture of trips from passing traffic in excess of these percentages must be justified by the applicant. Any claimed credit for internal absorption of trips for a mixed-use development must also be justified by the applicant. 
f.  Proposed development which generates 100 or fewer average daily trips shall not be subject to an individual concurrency certification. Trips generated by projects below the threshold level shall be recorded and applied to the traffic circulation network as part of the annual certification process. 
g.  Proposed development which generates 500 or more average daily trips shall submit a traffic impact analysis at the time an application for development approval is filed. This traffic analysis shall, at a minimum, include an analysis generated by the VCOG traffic analysis system. 
h.  Evaluation of the impact of proposed development upon roadway levels-of-service must take into consideration both the relative impact from adjoining jurisdictions and the relative responsibility of various jurisdictions to provide for improvements. This is particularly true for the following State Roads: Nova Road, Beville Road and Ridgewood Avenue (U.S. Highway 1), over which the FDOT has primary jurisdiction and responsibility for financing needed improvements. To the extent that planned improvements are behind schedule on these roadways due to no fault of the city (Nova Road is a notable case in point), the city should not be unduly and unfairly restricted from approving a limited amount of development so long as it does not substantially degrade the existing level- of-service. Additional traffic permitted on backlogged facilities will be governed by the level of services limits set by Policy 1-8 of the adopted Traffic Circulation Element of the South Daytona Comprehensive Plan. 
i.  Levels-of-service on local roadways within the city shall not be allowed to deteriorate to a level-of- service below the adopted "C" level-of-service standard for all local roadways. 
j.  In August/September of each year the city will discuss and coordinate roadway level-of-service issues with those entities either having primary responsibility for the roadways or directly affected by them: i.e. Volusia County, FDOT, local MPO, Daytona Beach, Port Orange and Daytona Beach Shores. 
k.  In September of each year, after coordinating with affected entities, the city will issue a roadway capacity reservation certification to cover both the following fiscal year and every succeeding year of the five-year period which begins with that initial fiscal year. This certification will indicate the specific capacity levels which will be allowed for each roadway within the city limits plus Beville Road. 
2.  Potable water facilities. In September of each year the city will obtain a potable water capacity reservation certification from the City of Daytona Beach. This certification will cover at least the following fiscal year and the five-year period which starts with that fiscal year. It will be based upon the projected city population for the periods in question multiplied by the projected city demand in gallons per capita (i.e. the city's adopted level-of-service standard for potable water facilities). The impact of a specific project will be calculated by determining the year of impact and then multiplying the population of the project at that point in time by the projected demand per capita (i.e. the city's adopted level-of-service standard for potable water facilities); then that final demand at impact for the project will be added to the final demand for any other proposed projects, and the cumulative total will be compared to the potable water capacity reservation certification to determine capacity availability for the specific project. 
In addition, all projects must be reviewed as to the adequacy of water pressure and water storage capacity according to the city's adopted level-of-service standards for those parameters. 
3.  Sanitary sewer facilities. In September of each year, the city will obtain a sanitary sewer capacity reservation certification from the City of Daytona Beach. This certification will cover at least the following fiscal year and the five-year period which starts with that fiscal year. It will be based upon the projected city population for the periods in question multiplied by the projected city flow in gallons per capita (i.e. the city's adopted level-of-service standard for sanitary sewer facilities). 
The impact of a specific project will be calculated by determining the year of impact and then multiplying the population of the project at that point in time by the projected flow per capita (i.e. the city's adopted level-of- service standard for sanitary sewer facilities); then that final demand at impact for the project will be added to the final demand for any other proposed projects, and the cumulative total will be compared to the sanitary sewer capacity reservation certification to determine capacity availability for the specific project. 
4.  Solid waste facilities. In September of each year the city will obtain a solid waste capacity reservation certification from Volusia County. This certification will cover at least both the following fiscal year and the five-year period which starts with that fiscal year. It will be based upon the projected city population for the periods in question multiplied by the projected city disposal in pounds per capita (i.e. the city's adopted level-of-service standard for solid waste facilities). 
The impact of a specific project will be calculated by determining the year of impact and then multiplying the population of the project at that a point in time by the projected disposal per capita (i.e. the city's adopted level-of-service standard for solid waste facilities), then that final demand at impact for the project will be added to the final demand for any other proposed projects, and the cumulative total will be compared to the solid waste capacity reservation certification to determine capacity availability for the specific project. 
5.  Drainage facilities. In September of each year the city will issue its own one- and five-year drainage facility adequacy certification which will state that concurrency compliance is assumed based upon the city's enforcement of its adopted level-of-service standard for on-site drainage. 
6.  Park and recreation facilities. In September of each year the city will issue its own recreation capacity reservation certification. This certification will cover at least both the following fiscal year and the five-year period (on a year-by-year basis) which starts with that fiscal year. It will be based upon the projected city population (in 1,000's) for the periods in question multiplied by the city's adopted level-of-service standard(s) (units per 1,000) for recreation facilities. 
The impact of a specific project will be calculated by determining the year of impact and then multiplying the population of the project (in 1,000's) at that point in time by the city's adopted level-of-service standard(s) (units per 1,000) for recreation facilities; then that final demand at impact for the project will be added to the final demand for any other projects proposed for the same fiscal year, and the cumulative total will be compared to the recreation capacity reservation certification for the time period in question to determine capacity availability for the specific project. 
E.  Projected need for additional facilities to meet concurrency requirement. 
1.  In the event that the city's concurrency analysis reveals that proposed or projected development will result in a concurrency deficiency in any one or more of the six types of critical public facilities for a particular fiscal year of project impact, the city must make sure that there is a financial or other legally binding commitment to correct the deficiency before it makes a finding of concurrency compliance on specific affected projects. This will require either the inclusion of timely remedial funding in the city's annual capital improvement program's budget, developer commitment (legally binding) to provide remedial funding, or some other legally binding obligation to correct the deficiency in a timely manner. 
2.  In the event that a development order or permit should not otherwise be issued due to the unavailability of adequate funding for necessary public facilities, the city will allow the developer to provide the facilities at his own expense contingent upon: the public facilities to be provided must not be inconsistent with the schedule of capital improvements in the comprehensive plan; the city and the developer must execute an enforceable development agreement which includes a construction schedule and a monitoring mechanism and penalty clauses (in case of non-compliance) to ensure concurrency. However, mere availability of public facility capacity for a proposed project, even if such availability is provided totally through developer financing, is not in itself sufficient justification for project approval; all of the city's project review criteria must be satisfied before the project can be approved. 
3.  In the event that available facility capacity will be insufficient to serve all competing development applications impacting in a given fiscal year and being reviewed simultaneously, the city will complete its review process and then prioritize the approval applications, and it will approve them in rank order only to the extent that it is determined that concurrent capacity will be available. Approvable applications will be ranked on a "first come, first served" basis by date of application in chronological order. 
4.  In the event that a project is rejected either because capacity is unavailable for it or through the ranking procedure described in the preceding paragraph, the city reserves the right to exercise the following options: deny the project; or defer the project; or require project modification; or conditionally approve the project. If the project is denied or deferred, the applicant will be given the opportunity to leave his application on file or to resubmit it when facility capacity becomes available. Such applications will be given chronological priority over subsequent applications but must be reviewed for full concurrency compliance if more than 45 days elapse between denial/deferral and reconsideration. 
F.  Vested rights. "Vested" means that a property is not subject to concurrency requirements because it was approved on or before April 10, 1990, the date of adoption of the city's comprehensive plan. Existing vacant residential, commercial, industrial and public buildings are considered vested. Vacant single-family building lots in platted and recorded subdivisions are considered vested. This means that any homes built upon those lots are also vested. Other projects must have had an active building permit as of April 10, 1990 to be considered vested. 
G.  "Last resort" provision. As a "last resort" measure, the city reserves the right to deny, delay or conditionally approve any development application or permit which would otherwise be issuable if the project review process clearly demonstrates, based upon convincing reasoning and documentation, that approval would adversely impact the levels-of- service of critical public facilities in such a way as to pose a clear threat to the health, safety or welfare of the community. 
H.  Capacity reservation fee. The city council may establish a capacity reservation fee in recognition of the value inherent in the reservation of service capacity for a specific development for a stated period of time. The award of the capacity reservation prevents the city from awarding this same capacity to another project. The specific fee will be established by resolution. 
I.  No later than August or September of each fiscal year, the concurrency manager will provide a report to the city council which evaluates the past performance of the CMS and, if needed, makes recommendations for improvement. This report may be combined with any other related report which must be issued during the same period. 
J.  Administration. Although the city council has the ultimate responsibility for the implementation of the CMS, various city agencies and officials carry out functions in the program. The city manager, as concurrency manager, provides administrative oversight for the program. However, the community development director/chief building official will be responsible for the day-to-day concurrency management decisions such as concurrency evaluations and the issuance of concurrency compliance certifications and building permits. Such agencies as the land development regulation board (LDRB) with respect to the comprehensive plan, subdivision review and concurrency appeals, and the board of adjustment with respect to other appeals, will exercise their statutory functions in the administrative process. 
K.  Appeals. 
1.  Except as otherwise provided in the City Code, appeals from concurrency determinations of city officials or agencies shall be taken before the land development regulation board (LDRB). Any such appeal must be filed in writing with the community development director (CDD) within 20 calendar days of rendition of the decision in question, and the reasons for such appeal shall be set forth therein. The CDD shall arrange for an appeal hearing before the LDRB and shall notify the appellant in writing of the date, time and place of the hearing. 
2.  The appellant shall have the burden of affirmatively demonstrating that the decision of the city official(s) was in error. Said official(s) shall have the opportunity to present information and argument to support the city's decision. 
3.  The board shall base its decision on the city's comprehensive plan and concurrency management regulations, and it shall make its decision employing its usual voting procedures. The decision shall be issued in writing stating the reasoning involved, and it shall be rendered within 60 days of the close of the hearing. 
4.  In the event that either the appellant or the concurrency manager wishes to appeal the matter further, that may be done to the city council by filing a written appeal, setting forth the reasons therefore, with the city clerk within 20 calendar days after rendition of the decision by the board. The city clerk shall arrange for a hearing before the city council, and shall notify the appellant in writing of the date, time and place of the hearing. Consideration shall be limited to the record established before the board and argument of the parties involved. The city council shall base its decision on applicable laws and regulations. It shall make its decision using its usual voting procedures. The decision shall be issued in writing stating the reasoning involved, and it shall be rendered within 60 days of the close of the hearing. No further administrative appeal is available beyond this stage, though the appellant retains the right of appeal through the judicial system. 
Sec. 4.3. - Statements on intergovernmental coordination. 
    The intergovernmental matrix table (Table 1C-1) from the South Daytona Comprehensive Plan, which illustrates the intergovernmental relationships and requirements that are necessary and prerequisite in order for a development order to be issued, is hereby incorporated by reference. Any additions or deletions made to said Matrix to reflect changes in regulatory management shall not require an amendment herein.

Sec. 4.4. - Proportionate fair-share transportation regulations. 
I.  Short title, authority, and applicability. 
(A)  This section shall be known as the "proportionate fair-share transportation regulations." 
(B)  The city council is required to adopt this section in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 163.3180 (16). 
(C)  The provisions of this section shall apply to all developments within the City of South Daytona that impact a major roadway segment which has failed to achieve transportation concurrency by having a level-of-service below that adopted by the entity (whether city, county, or state) having competent jurisdiction. 
(D)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to developments of regional impact (DRI's) or to developments exempted from concurrency or to developments creating de minimis impacts. 
II.  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to establish a method for mitigating the impacts of development on transportation facilities through the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors. More specifically, the proportionate fair-share mechanism is intended to enable developers to meet transportation concurrency requirements by paying their proportionate fair share of the cost of roadway improvements impacted by their proposed developments. 
III.  Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following terms shall be defined as follows unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. 
(A)  Capital improvements. The outlay of capital of funds for the planning of, engineering of, acquisition of materials for, acquisition of land for, and construction of roads, related pedestrian/bikeways, turn lanes, intersection improvements and signalization; this does not include maintenance. 
(B)  Capital improvements plan. The five-year capital improvements schedule contained in the Comprehensive Plan of the City of South Daytona. 
(C)  Developer. Any person(s) or entity, whether public or private, undertaking the development of land. 
(D)  Fair-share transportation facilities fee. The fee required to be paid by a developer in accordance with the terms of this section ("proportionate fair-share transportation regulations"). 
(E)  Land. The earth, water, and air above, below, or on the surface, which term includes any improvements or structures customarily regarded as land. 
(F)  Land development activity generating traffic. The conduct of any building activity or the making of any material change in the use of any land or structure that attracts or produces vehicular trips over and above those produced by the existing state of the land, consequently placing an additional demand on the major roadway network. 
(G)  Major roadway network. All arterial and collector roadways within the city, including any such proposed roads necessitated by new development activity generating vehicular traffic. 
IV.  General requirements. 
(A)  A developer may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
1.  The proposed development is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and applicable Land Development Regulations; and 
2.  The five-year capital improvements schedule in the capital improvements element of the Comprehensive Plan includes a transportation capital improvement that, upon completion, will accommodate the additional traffic generated by the proposed development. 
(B)  The city may choose to allow a developer to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fair-share contribution to an improvement, that upon completion, will accommodate the additional traffic generated by the proposed development, which improvement is not contained in the five-year capital improvements schedule and one of the following conditions applies: 
1.  The city adds the improvement to the five-year capital improvements schedule no later than the next regular capital improvements schedule update of the Comprehensive Plan, provided that the improvement is financially feasible as defined by F.S. § 163.3180 (16)(b)(1); or 
2.  If the funds in the five-year capital improvements schedule are insufficient to fully fund the construction of the improvement, the city may enter into a proportionate fair-share agreement with the developer authorizing construction of that amount of development upon which the proportionate fair-share amount is calculated, if the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will, in the opinion of the city council, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system, provided that said improvements are adopted into the five-year capital improvements schedule no later than the next regular capital improvements update of the Comprehensive Plan. 
(C)  Any transportation capital improvement proposed to meet the developer's proportionate fair-share obligation must meet the design standards of the city for city-maintained roads and the design standards of other applicable governmental entities for roads under their jurisdiction. 
V.  Application process. 
(A)  A developer who applies to commence any land development activity which would result in a failure of a road segment to meet transportation concurrency may apply to the city for a proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(B)  Prior to submission of an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, a pre-application meeting shall be held with city staff to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and other relevant issues. If the road segment that would fail to meet transportation concurrency is on the Strategic Intermodal System (SIS), the Florida Dept. of Transportation (FDOT) shall be requested to participate in the pre-application meeting; other directly affected jurisdictions may also be invited to participate in said meeting. 
(C)  Application review procedures: 
1.  The developer shall submit an application to the community development director that includes a non-refundable application fee of $2,000.00 (which fee shall be credited toward what is ultimately determined to be the developer's proportionate fair-share contribution), plus the following: 
a.  Name, address and contact information of the developer; 
b.  A survey and legal description of the land; 
c.  Project schedule (including phases, if applicable); 
d.  Description of the requested fair-share mitigation; 
e.  If the requested fair-share mitigation involves a road segment on the Strategic Intermodal System (SIS), evidence of concurrence from FDOT; and 
f.  Traffic study performed by a licensed traffic engineer demonstrating failure of road segment to meet transportation concurrency. 
2.  Within 20 days of receipt of the application, the community development director shall conduct his review of the application to determine its completeness. If the application is not complete, a written statement shall be sent to the developer delineating the deficiencies; if such deficiencies are not remedied by the developer within 30 days of receipt of the written notice, then the application shall be deemed to be abandoned. The community development director, in his sole discretion, may grant an extension to cure such deficiencies if the developer shows good cause and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure. 
3.  If the community development director determines that the application is complete, he shall provide written notification of such to the developer and forward the application to the city attorney, who shall, within 30 days, draft a proportionate fair-share agreement for consideration by the city council at a meeting to be held no later than 60 days from the date that the developer received notice that the application was complete. 
4.  No proportionate fair-share agreement shall be effective until approved by the city council. 
VI.  Determination of proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(A)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and contributions of transportation facilities. 
(B)  The methodology used to calculate a developer's proportionate fair-share obligation is represented by the following formula, pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(12): 
Proportionate Share = [(Development Trips)/(SV Increase) × Cost] 
Where: 
Development Trips = Those trips from the development that are assigned to the affected roadway segment. 
SV Increase = Service volume increase provided by the improvement to the affected roadway segment. 
Cost = Adjusted cost of the improvement. 
(C)  For the purpose of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, improvement costs shall be based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained, as appropriate, from the city's five-year capital improvements schedule, the Transportation Improvement Program of the Volusia County MPO, the Road Program of the County of Volusia, or the Work Program of FDOT. If information is not available from such sources, the improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods: 
1.  An analysis by the community development department of costs, adjusted by the FDOT Price Trends Index from the previous year, by cross section type, that incorporates data from recent projects; or 
2.  The most recent issue of the FDOT "Transportation Costs," as adjusted based upon the type of cross section; locally available data from recent projects as to acquisition, drainage, and utility costs; and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. 
(D)  If the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the developer, the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section. 
(E)  If the city has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued as of the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value by the Volusia County Property Appraiser or, with mutual agreement of the city and the developer, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and not at city expense. The developer shall supply to the city a certificate of title or title search of the land at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the developer is less than the city-estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for the development, then the developer must pay the difference. 
VII.  Transportation facilities impact fee credit. 
(A)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation payments shall be applied as a credit against impact fees. Credits will be given for that portion of the impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements upon which the proportionate fair-share contribution is calculated. Also, if the proportionate fair-share contribution is based upon only a portion of the traffic generated by the development, the credit will be limited to that portion of the impact fees upon which the proportionate fair-share contribution is based. 
(B)  At the time that the proportionate fair-share obligation is being determined, the city will also compute the transportation facilities impact fee obligation for the proposed development. If the developer's proportionate fair-share obligation is less than the total transportation facilities impact fee anticipated for the development, the developer must pay the difference to the city. 
VIII.  Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(A)  If the developer fails to apply for a building permit within one year of the date of execution of the proportionate fair-share agreement, the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the developer shall be required to reapply in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(B)  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be nonrefundable. If the payment is submitted after one year from the date of execution of the agreement, the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based upon the best estimate of construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment pursuant to these regulations and adjusted accordingly. 
(C)  Developer improvements authorized herein involving dedications to the city must be completed upon final acceptance of the improvements and receipt of a warranty bond in a form approved by the city attorney. 
(D)  Developer improvements authorized herein not involving dedications to the city must be completed upon recording of a final plat or upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, whichever occurs first. 
(E)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to the issuance of a development order will be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent that the change would generate additional traffic. 
(F)  A developer may present the city with a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. However, the application fee paid to the city shall be nonrefundable. 
IX.  Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(A)  All proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of improvements contained in the five-year capital improvements schedule, or for use as might otherwise be established as per terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(B)  In the event that a scheduled transportation facility improvement is removed from the five-year capital improvements schedule, then the revenues already collected for its construction shall be applied toward the construction of another improvement within the same transportation corridor that would mitigate the impacts of development, as determined by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 06-21, § 1, 12-12-06) 
ARTICLE V. - ZONING REGULATIONS 

Sec. 5.1. - General provisions. 
A.  Title. These regulations shall be known as the "Zoning Regulations (or Zoning Code) of the City of South Daytona, Florida." 
B.  Purpose and intent. These zoning regulations have been prepared with due consideration to existing conditions and future development of the city according to general policies expressed in the Comprehensive Land Use Plan as adopted by the city council on April 10, 1990 and any subsequent amendments. 
    This article is designed to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city by regulating the use and development of land and water: 
1.  To provide for an efficient, equitable, economical, and environmentally sound pattern of urban development; 
2.  To secure safety from fire, wind, and other dangers; 
3.  To provide adequate light and air and to prevent the overcrowding of land; 
4.  To avoid undue concentration of population; and 
5.  To facilitate provision for adequate transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public needs; and 
6.  To place similar land uses together in the same district and to minimize incompatibilities between different adjoining land uses. 
    The zoning regulations and districts are developed in light of the aforementioned objectives and considering the character of the districts and their suitability for particular uses of land. These regulations and districts work toward preserving desirable environmental features while allowing the greatest possible use and enjoyment of individual properties. They strive to protect the values of buildings and land and the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties. In general, the zoning regulations regulate land use and land development with the overarching goal of promoting and protecting the public welfare. 
C.  Jurisdiction. The provisions of this article shall apply inside the corporate limits of the City of South Daytona, Florida. 
Sec. 5.2. - Establishment of districts and official zoning map. 
A.  Establishment of districts. The City of South Daytona, Florida, is hereby divided into zoning districts as specified in this article and shown on the official zoning map of the city which, together with all explanatory material therein, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these zoning regulations. 
B.  Official zoning map. 
1.  Identification of official map: The official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor of the City of South Daytona, be attested by the city clerk, and bear the seal of the city under the following words: "This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map referred to in the Zoning Regulations of the City of South Daytona, Florida." 
2.  Changes in district boundaries: If, in accordance with provisions of this article, changes are made in district boundaries or other matter on the official zoning map, such changes shall be recorded promptly on the map by inserting the date when the amendment was adopted, the ordinance number adopting the amendment, and the mayor's signature attested by the city clerk, in the spaces provided for such entries. 
3.  Official map final authority: Regardless of the existence of so-called "versions" and copies of the city zoning map which may from time-to-time be made or published, the official zoning map, which shall be kept under the responsible charge of the city clerk, shall be the final graphic authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings, and other structures within the city limits. However, the legal description of all zoning ordinances shall be the final legal authority as to the zoning status of land. 
4.  Retention of earlier zoning maps: All zoning maps or remaining portions thereof which have had official force and effect in the city prior to the effective date of these zoning regulations shall be retained as a public record and as a guide to the zoning status of lands and water under the jurisdiction of the city prior to the adoption of this Code. 
5.  Replacement of official zoning map: In the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, or because of deterioration, the city council shall act to replace the prior official zoning map. The new official zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official zoning map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original official zoning map or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor of the City of South Daytona, attested by the city clerk, and bear the seal of the city under the following words: "This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted on the ____________ / ____________ / ____________ day of ____________ , by Ordinance No. ____________ of South Daytona, Florida." (Insert date map was replaced). Unless the prior Official Zoning Map has been lost or totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining shall be preserved together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment.

A.  Interpretation of district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
1.  Boundaries approximately following streets, highways, alleys, or rights-of-way: Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, alleys, or rights-of-way shall be construed to follow such centerlines. In the event a right-of-way is vacated, the district boundary shall be construed as remaining in its location except when ownership of the vacated street is divided other than at the center, in which case the boundary shall be construed as moving with the ownership. 
2.  Boundaries approximately following platted lot lines: Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines. 
3.  Boundaries approximately following city limits: Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be construed as following such city limits.

5.  Boundaries approximately following bulkhead lines, shore lines, streams, or other water bodies: Boundaries indicated as following bulkhead or shore lines shall be construed to follow such bulkhead lines or shore lines, and in the event of change, the bulkhead line or shore line shall be construed as moving with the newly established bulkhead line or the actual shore line; boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
6.  Boundaries indicated as entering any body of water: Boundaries that are indicated as entering any body of water, but not continuing to intersect with other zoning boundaries, shall be construed as extending in the direction in which they enter the body of water to intersect with other zoning districts. 
7.  Boundaries approximately parallel to or extensions of above features: Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map. 
8.  District boundary dividing a lot: Where a district boundary divides a lot of record at the time the boundary was established and where the division makes impractical the reasonable use of the lot, the extension of the regulations for either portion of the lot may be permitted, not to exceed 50 feet beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot. 
B.  Community development director (CDD) to interpret boundaries in cases of discrepancy between actual features and zoning map: Where discrepancies exist between natural or manmade features existing on the ground and those not shown on the official zoning map, or in other circumstances not covered by sections above, the CDD shall interpret the district boundaries.

Sec. 5.6. - Supplementary regulations. 
    Regulations under this section shall apply to all zoning districts and to all buildings, structures, and uses of land or water in all zoning districts except as may otherwise be provided in the following regulations: 
A.  Accessory uses and structures. Specific uses and structures, except for fences and walls, which are covered under a separate section of this Code, shall be additionally governed by the following regulations: 
1.  Setback encroachments for uses and structures other than sheds. No accessory use or structure shall be located in any required front yard or in any required side or rear yard except as provided for below: 
a.  Accessory structures may be located no closer than five feet from the rear property line. 
b.  Air conditioner compressors may extend three and one-half feet into a required yard. In no case should this encroachment exceed 50 percent of the required setback. 
c.  Roof overhangs may extend three feet into a required yard. In no case should this encroachment exceed 50 percent of the required setback. 
d.  Structures which are not enclosed by walls or roofs may be allowed in any required side or rear yards as long as a minimum distance of five feet from the lot line is maintained, except that driveways, concrete pads, sidewalks, etc. may be closer than five feet from the lot line if the chief building official determines that proper drainage can be maintained. 
e.  In all residential districts, the height of accessory structures shall not exceed 15 feet. 
2.  Setback encroachments and number and size limitations for sheds. 
a.  No shed shall be located in the front yard or side corner yard of a residential property. 
b.  A shed may be located in the rear yard but no closer than five feet from the rear property line. 
c.  A shed may be located in the side yard of a residential property provided that it does not encroach into the required side yard setback. 
d.  The number of sheds on a residential property is limited to two. 
e.  The combined total footprint area of all sheds, including existing ones, on a residential property shall not exceed 200 square feet. 
f.  Sheds in zoning districts other than residential shall not be located in the required front yard, side yard, or side corner yard. 
g.  No shed shall exceed 11 feet in height. 
h.  "Side corner yard" is defined as that portion of the yard behind the front yard that lies between the plane of the side of the house and the paved street which it faces. 
i.  "Side yard" is defined as that portion of the yard behind the front yard that lies between the side of the house and adjoining side lot line with the neighboring property. 
j.  "Shed" is defined as any storage structure that is either attached to or detached from the principal structure and designed primarily for storage of small items such as yard equipment, tools, toys, bicycles etc., but the term does not include a garage designed for the storage of automobiles. 
3.  Outside storage. Outside storage of new and used equipment and materials shall be regulated as follows: 
a.  Commercial zones: No outside storage of equipment or materials shall be allowed in commercial zones, with the following exceptions: 
[1]  Landscape or garden supplies in fenced areas approved as part of the commercial site plan. 
[2]  Display set-ups of products customarily used out of doors. 
[3]  Sidewalk sales - Sidewalk sales of new and used merchandise may be held in commercial zones under the following conditions: 
a.  Sidewalk sales by a business in front of its locale shall be allowed by permit from the community development department. 
b.  A sidewalk sales does not include a special event sale that extends beyond the sidewalk in front of the business; special event sales extending beyond the sidewalk shall only be allowed by special event permit. 
c.  A sidewalk sale will generally be considered a temporary promotional event to be allowed for no more that seven consecutive calendar days at a time and a total of 30 days per calendar year per business location. The interval between any two consecutive sidewalk sales at the same business location shall be at least seven consecutive days. 
d.  The sole exceptions to sidewalk sales as a temporary promotional event are: 
(1)  Sidewalk sale of fresh fruits and vegetables in front of a business that, as part of its regular operation, offers such produce for sale indoors; and 
(2)  Sidewalk sale of such products customarily used outdoors as landscape or garden supplies, lawn mowers, and similar items, so long as they are sold as part of the regular business operation. Such sidewalk sales shall be limited to the regular hours of the business. 
e.  Sidewalk sales shall be limited to private property and shall not be conducted on public right-of-way or public sidewalk. 
f.  Sidewalk sales activity must not impede pedestrian traffic; this means leaving at least approximately two and one-half feet of sidewalk open for pedestrian traffic.

[2]  All material shall be secured, if necessary, to withstand winds. 
[3]  Required landscape areas along property lines shall be maintained on the exterior of storage screening walls. 
[4]  Screening shall not be required around storage areas for landscape plant material. 
4.  Other outdoor special events. Special outdoor events sponsored by businesses, other that those activities covered by "itinerant merchant," "sidewalk sales," car washes, fund-raisers by non-profit organizations, or other activities for which the City Code does not require city council approval, must either be approved or denied by either the city manager or the city council on a case-by-case basis with regard to obtaining a permit to hold the proposed special event. The city manager shall determine which such events will be referred to the city council. The number of such special events per business location shall not exceed one per calendar quarter unless otherwise approved for good cause by the city council on a case-by-case basis. These special event requests shall be reviewed by the community development director for his recommendation prior to consideration by the city manager or the city council. The city shall charge a non-refundable permit fee for this type of special event request, except that if the proceeds are to be used for charitable purposes, the permit fee shall be waived. The permit fee shall be in accordance with the following fee schedule: 
a.  Businesses possessing regular City of South Daytona Local Business Tax Receipt--$25.00 fee.

c.  Motor vehicle dealers not possessing regular City of South Daytona Local Business Tax Receipt who have for sale more than ten motor vehicles--$300.00 fee. 
5.  Prohibited accessory structures. Accessory structures shall be of the same building material, color, shape and dimension as the principal structure on the same property, unless the city manager or designee approves a variation. In reviewing a request for a variation the following will not be permitted: 
a.  Any kitsch architecture (such as a building that does not resemble a typical structure), including but not limited to: structures or elements that resemble an exaggerated plant, fish, edible food, or other such items that resemble giant oranges, ice cream cones, dinosaurs, pet animals, or farm animals. This is not applicable to freestanding signs. 
b.  Any structure that is inconsistent and/or incompatible with the surrounding structures. Examples of such structures would include but not limited to: Igloos, domes or geodesic domes, teepees, log cabins, western "false fronts", medieval castles, caves and other structures of a similar architectural oddity. 
c.  Attached or detached Quonset-type or style accessory structure, usually defined as a self-supporting structure, typically in an "arch" or curved shape with no interior posts, trusses or support beams of any kind and the exterior sheeting forming the building. 
All accessory structures, including sheds, located on a corner lot must be positioned behind the front plane of the principal structure on the adjacent lot(s). 
B.  Authority to enter upon private property. The following representatives of the city in the performance of their duties under the provisions of this ordinance, may enter upon any land and make examinations and surveys as deemed necessary in the administration and enforcement of these regulations: any member of the LDRB; any member of the BOAA; and any member of the CEB; any authorized employee of the city. 
C.  Bufferyards. In addition to required setbacks, landscaped bufferyards shall be developed between differing land uses based on this section. These requirements shall be deemed the minimum necessary to achieve compatibility between land uses. Bufferyards shall be developed by the more intense use based on existing contiguous uses, zoning, or land use plan designation, whichever is most intense. 
1.  Land use intensity factor: 
TABLE 3. LAND USE INTENSITY 
Land Use Intensity Factor Residential up through 5 units/acre 2 Residential from 6 through 10 units/acre 3 Commercial less than .50 ISR* 4 Commercial .50-.65 ISR 5 Commercial .65 ISR or greater 6 Industrial less than .65 ISR 7 Industrial .65 ISR or greater 8  
*Impervious surface ratio (ISR) - percentage of building and paved area. ISR measurement shall not include required bufferyards under this section. 
2.  Bufferyard requirements: Bufferyard requirements shall be determined by subtracting the intensity factor of the least intense use from that of the more intense use. Where two differing land uses are opposite each other across a road right-of-way, the intensity factor difference shall be further reduced as follows: 
TABLE 4. BUFFERYARD REQUIREMENTS 
Right-of-Way Width Reduction of Intensity 30 ft. or less 0 31 ft. through 70 ft. 1 71 ft. through 100 ft. 2 101 ft. to 150 ft. 3 151 ft. or more 4  
Bufferyard design type shall be based on the difference using the following table: 
TABLE 5. BUFFERYARD PER 100 LINEAL FEET 
Design Type Width Shade Trees Understory Trees Shrubs 1 5 ft. 2 2 20 2 10 ft. 3 3 30 3 20 ft. 4 4 40 4 30 ft. 5 6 50 5 40 ft. 7 8 60  
3.  Fences and walls. 
a.  The DRC may require the provision of an opaque fence or wall between commercial and residential areas if a pre-existing pattern is there or if that is desirable as a buffer between the two adjacent land uses; otherwise no wall or fence shall be required in addition to the bufferyard. Fence requirements between multi-family parking areas and commercial office parking areas may be waived by the DRC. 
b.  Optional - A six-foot high fence or wall may be substituted for ten feet of required bufferyard width and 25 percent of required landscape material when the intensity factor difference is three or greater. 
D.  Deed restrictions. These regulations shall not affect any deed restrictions or restrictive covenants recorded with any deed, plat, or other legal document. No person or agency, in the capacity of administering and enforcing these regulations shall be responsible for enforcing any deed restrictions or restrictive covenants. 
E.  Fences and walls. All fences and walls shall be constructed in compliance with applicable building codes and according to the following dimensions and use regulations. 
1.  Purpose and intent: All fences must be substantially constructed of materials approved for the purpose. In all zoning areas, the administrative official may impose additional restrictions upon the height or location of fences or walls where they are deemed to constitute an impairment to traffic safety or are detrimental to normal visibility or air circulation from adjoining properties. Minor modification of a requirement may be allowed if the CDD and the CBO agree that the facts of a specific physical situation would make it unreasonable to strictly impose the requirement. Nothing in this section supersedes or eliminates screening walls or fences required by other sections of this Code. 
2.  R1a, R1b, R1c, and R2 Residential Districts. 
a.  Definitions: 
1.  "Decorative wall": A wall constructed of brick, concrete block, or other masonry materials which is designed, constructed, and finished with the intent and result of providing an attractive visual accent to the property upon which is it located. 
2.  "Decorative fence": A fence constructed of wrought iron or other durable, long-lasting material, other than a common wooden fence, which is designed, constructed, and finished with the intent and result of providing an attractive visual accent to the property upon which it is located. 
3.  "Frontage yard": A yard which abuts a street. Such yards generally consist of front and side-corner yards. 
b.  Front yards: For front yards which abut a street, fences or walls of open or solid face construction shall be permitted in compliance with the following criteria: 
No fence or wall may be installed closer than 25 feet from the right-of-way of the abutting street. Any such fence or wall shall not exceed a height of six feet if it is located at or behind the plane of the street-facing-wall of the principal building; however, if it is located streetward of such plane, it shall not exceed four feet in height. 
c.  Side yards: For side yards which abut a street, fences or walls of open or solid face construction shall be permitted in compliance with the following criteria: 
No fence or wall may be installed closer than ten feet from the right-of-way of the abutting street. Any such fence or wall shall not exceed a height of six feet if it is located at or behind the plane of the street-facing-wall of the principal building; however, if it is located streetward of such plane, it shall not exceed four feet in height. 
d.  Exception for decorative fences or walls: The LDRB may authorize decorative fences or walls in the front yard closer to the street right-of-way than otherwise allowed in this ordinance. Such fences or walls shall not exceed four feet in height. When considering whether to authorize a decorative fence or wall, the LDRB shall use the following guidelines: 
• The fence/wall material must be durable and attractive, something that does not rapidly deteriorate and is relatively easy to maintain. 
• Acceptable materials shall include, but are not limited to, the following: natural or artificial stone, brick, masonry, wrought iron, and stuccoed concrete block. 
• Unacceptable materials shall include, but are not limited to, the following: ordinary chain-link fencing, and common wooden fences such as shadow-box, picket, board, and post and rail. 
• Proposed fences and walls must be compatible in style, materials, location, etc. with those found in the front yards of neighboring properties abutting the same street. 
e.  Side and rear yards which do not abut a street: In side and rear yards which do not abut a street fence or walls must comply with the following location and height requirements: fences or walls of open or solid face construction shall be permitted in the yard behind (not abutting a street) the frontage yard with a height not exceeding six feet at all lot lines or interior areas of any such yard, including the boundary line between it and any frontage yards. 
f.  Waterfront yards: Fences and walls of open or solid face construction shall be permitted at all waterfront yard lot liens and interior waterfront yard areas not to exceed four feet in height. For the purpose of measuring a fence in a waterfront yard, the point of measurement shall be the mean high water line or the seawall, whichever is closer to the principal structure or buildable yard area. 
g.  Vacant lots: Fences and walls or open or solid face construction may be permitted on vacant residential lots provided that they are not installed closer than 25 feet from the abutting street for a front yard and ten feet from the abutting street for a side yard; such fences shall not exceed four feet in height. Where the side yard does not abut a street or for rear yards, there is no setback limitation, and the fence/wall may be located anywhere in the side or rear yard at a height not to exceed six feet. 
h.  "Grand-fathering" of existing fences and walls: All existing fences and walls which do not conform with the location and height restrictions of this ordinance shall be allowed to continue in existence as such in accordance with the following conditions: Any such fence or wall may be: (1) repaired to code; (2) replaced if damaged or destroyed by a natural event, such as a storm; (3) replaced if damaged or destroyed due to an accident. Provided, however, that replacement under the aforementioned circumstances must be accomplished within 90 days after permit issuance; if replacement is not completed within that time, the replacement structure must be brought into conformance. Also, any fence or wall which has deteriorated beyond the point of repair shall not be grandfathered and when replaced shall conform with the location and height requirements of the current regulations. The determination of the condition "deteriorated beyond point of repair" shall be made by the community development director or his designee, and the term shall mean that 50 percent or more of the overall fence materials need replacement due to deterioration caused by the "ravages of time" and lack of maintenance. 
2.1.  Residential districts other than R1a, R1b, R1c, and R2. Fences and walls of open or solid face construction shall be permitted at all lot lines or interior areas of front, side and rear yards. However, said fences and walls shall not exceed the following height limits: four feet in the front yard, and six feet in the side and rear yards. 
3.  Business districts. Except for required screening walls, fencing of open or solid face construction shall follow the requirements outlined for residential districts. 
4.  Industrial districts. Except for required screening walls, fences or walls not to exceed six feet in height may be permitted at all lot lines or interior areas for security or safety reasons. 
5.  Design and maintenance. 
a.  All fences shall be maintained in their original upright condition.

4.  Itinerant merchant activities. Definitions. 
a.  Itinerant merchant (IM) - Any person, organization, or other entity selling, displaying, promotion, or giving away merchandise, products, or services at a location external to a regularly licensed structure, on either a temporary or permanent basis. Each such person must obtain his own itinerant merchant license (IML) from the community development department of the city; no two or more such persons may share or operate under the same itinerant merchant license. Any person who claims to be an employee of an itinerant merchant but appears to community development staff to be operating as an independent merchant must be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the community development director that he meets the legal definition of employee; otherwise he will be classified as a separate IM. The term "itinerant merchant" covers a business operator on his own property when he engages there in outside sales/display of goods/services that are not part of the normal business activities covered by his business tax receipt. 
b.  Sales or display or activity area - The area used for the sales, display, or activities of special event, itinerant merchant, or other products, materials, services, etc. This area is to be measured from the outer-most item, display, edge of structure, or edge of business activity. The community development director or his designee shall measure and determine the boundaries and size of this area. 
c.  Open area - The area of a property that is not occupied by a structure or other physical phenomena which would make impractical the use of such area for an itinerant merchant set-up, activities, or related parking. The community development director or his designee shall measure and determine the boundaries and size of this area. 
d.  Non-profit vendor - A vendor who has obtained and presents from the United States Internal Revenue Service a currently valid certification that it has been awarded for at least two years charitable tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(4) or comparable (as respects charitable status) Section of the IRS Code. Even if a for-profit enterprise proposes to donate the proceeds of its sales to a non-profit or charitable cause, such a procedure shall not qualify it as a nonprofit vendor. For purposes of the itinerant merchant provisions of this Code, the only qualified nonprofit vendors are those charitable vendors either domiciled in the City of South Daytona or elsewhere in Volusia County provided that these latter organizations ordinarily offer their services to residents of South Daytona. 
e.  Motorhome - For purposes of the itinerant merchant section of this Code, the term "motorhome" includes any vehicle, recreational vehicle, truck, van, or trailer, etc. whether motorized or not, which contains sleeping facilities. 
5.  Itinerant merchant activities. Other provisions. With the exception of certain events specially approved by the city council, itinerant merchant activities shall be limited to the major sanctioned racing event period at the Daytona International Speedway commonly known as "Spring Bike Week." For that event the following regulations shall apply and shall supersede all other regulations and/or ordinances pertaining to activities regulated under this section: 
a.  An itinerant merchant with proof of authorization from the person or entity that has legal control of the property for a business use (generally the owner or the lessee), which the itinerant merchant selects for location, may apply for an itinerant merchant license (IML) except that no such merchant may engage in an activity which is not a permitted use in the zoning district (tattooing). Each itinerant merchant must obtain their own IML separate from any other itinerant merchant because there shall be no more than one itinerant merchant permitted for each IML. The city may hold the license-holder and the property-owner or lessee responsible for the itinerant merchant's compliance with the requirements of this section. However, in order for a business to be allowed to have itinerant merchants on its property the following conditions must be met: (1) The business must have a current city business tax receipt issued at least six months prior to the special event, (2) The business must have been in operation for at least six consecutive months prior to the special event, (3) The business must have been operating for a least 130 days during the aforementioned six-month period, and (4) In order for a "day" to qualify, the business must operate at least four hours during a day. 
b.  An owner of a business domiciled at a business general commercial zoned property along Ridgewood Avenue may obtain a "fee-free" itinerant merchant license enabling him to sell or provide for free his own goods and services at outside locations on his property provided that he is ordinarily allowed to sell same indoors under his regular business tax receipt, with the condition that in order for a business to do so the following requirements must be met: (1) The business must have a current city business tax receipt issued at least six months prior to the special event. (2) The business must have been in operation for at least six consecutive months prior to the special event. (3) The business must have been operating for at least 130 days during the aforementioned six-month period. (4) In order for a "day" to qualify, the business must operate at least four hours during a day. There is one exception to this rule: no such business shall be allowed to sell food/beverages outdoors unless it is ordinarily allowed to sell same under its regular business tax receipt. 
c.  An owner of a business domiciled at a business general commercial zoned property along Ridgewood Avenue may obtain an IML enabling him to sell outdoors goods and services not ordinarily covered for indoor sale under his regular business tax receipt. In this case, the usual itinerant merchant license fee shall be payable except that no such fee is payable if the goods or services are provided free of charge. However, in order for a business to do so the following requirements must be met: (1) The business must have a current city business tax receipt issued at least six months prior to the special event. (2) The business must have been in operation for at least six consecutive months prior to the special event. (3) The business must have been operating for at least 130 days during the aforementioned six-month period. (4) In order for a "day" to qualify, the business must operate at least four hours during a day. 
d.  The application shall be submitted to the community development department of the city on forms supplied by that department. The completed application must be approved by the department and the associated fee(s) paid before issuance of an IML by the department. 
e.  Each itinerant merchant license issued must be posted at the business location so that it is readily visible to the passing public. 
f.  Merchandise displayed and sold by itinerant merchants shall be of a special event nature, which generally means retail goods and services for special event patrons. Merchants dispensing food and beverages outdoors must be qualified by the city as nonprofit unless said dispensing is conducted on a property where the property-owner or tenant has a business tax receipt which allows the regular sale of food and beverages, and must meet requirements as set forth in (a) and (b) of these regulations, in which case the vendor may be either a for-profit vendor or a nonprofit vendor. Where fences are required to delineate outdoor alcohol serving areas, as well as parking areas for automobiles, motorcycles and the handicapped, a four-foot-high orange construction fence shall be erected to enclose the event area. All fencing must be in place prior to the site inspection for the event. No nonprofit food/beverage vendor may dispense alcoholic beverages. 
g.  Such temporary displays and sales may be conducted only during the major sanctioned racing event periods at the Daytona International Speedway known as Spring Bike Week and Biketoberfest. The term "racing event period" is defined as the scheduled racing activity plus registration and practice; but in no case shall any one event period exceed ten consecutive days. In addition to the event period itself, the period of pre-event on-site setup, including any parking or storage, of vendor paraphernalia shall be limited to a maximum of 48 hours, and the period of post-event take-down or demobilization, including any parking or storage, of vendor paraphernalia shall be limited to a like maximum of 48 hours. If there is any question as to what constitutes the "major sanctioned racing event" or the dates thereof, that determination shall be made by the City Council of the City of South Daytona. 
h.  Such temporary displays and sales may only be permitted in a business general commercial zoning district located adjacent to U.S.1 (Ridgewood Avenue). The special event activities may not extend beyond the business general commercial zone on the sponsoring property, with the exception that customer parking may be located on adjacent property in a different zoning district if permitted by city ordinance. 
i.  No activity area shall be located within a public street; except that if the street has been officially closed, a city affiliated non-profit organization may locate an activity on the closed street. No activity area shall encroach upon space needed for customer parking or pedestrian or vehicular traffic flow. 
j.  Each itinerant merchant shall be permitted to have no more than one sign, which may be a pennant or banner not exceeding the approximate dimensions of five feet in length and three feet in width. 
k.  Up to 50 percent of the open area of a property may be used for special event displays, tents, structures, sales, activity areas, etc. At least a significant portion of the remaining open area must be made available for customer parking. In the case of strip shopping centers, the term "property" shall mean the entire strip shopping center; shopping center management must agree to the itinerant merchant proposal of any individual business in the shopping center; once 50 percent of the open area of the shopping center is obligated for itinerant merchant activities, no other business in the shopping center may arrange for an itinerant merchant license. The boundaries and size of the activity areas and parking areas shall be determined by the community development director or his designee. Properties may be either owned, rented, or leased by the permittee. Where contiguous properties for itinerant merchant use are under the control of the same party, for purposes of determining open area, activity area, and parking area, the community development department may consider them to be a single property. The term "contiguous" in this context does not include the meaning "across the street from." 
l.  Prior to the actual start of the major sanctioned racing event period, each party desiring to sponsor itinerant merchant activities on property he controls must reach agreement with the city as to the overall sizes and locations of activity and parking areas on that property. 
m.  The number of itinerant merchants per property is only limited by whatever number may be comfortably accommodated on 50 percent of the open area of that property without jeopardizing the health, safety, or welfare of the public and allowing for adequate customer parking and pedestrian and vehicular access and circulation. The calculation of 50 percent of the open area of the property will be made by the community development director or his designee, but there is no specific minimum or maximum square footage allowed per itinerant merchant. 
n.  Where more than one itinerant merchant set-up is located on a property, the itinerant merchant set-ups must be located in a "clustered" manner such that they are no more than ten feet apart. A single cluster shall consist of two or more itinerant merchant set-ups separated from one another by no more than ten feet, but separated from any other cluster by a minimum distance of approximately 15 feet. By prearrangement with the community development department, and depending upon the number of itinerant merchants and the size of the open area available, properties may be permitted more than one cluster. 
o.  No semi-trailers used exclusively for storage of merchandise may be parked on a property used for itinerant merchant activity except to the rear of a principal building so that said vehicle is not readily visible from U.S.1 (Ridgewood Ave.). 
p.  If a business ordinarily serves food and beverages at a specific outdoor location on the subject property, the business may continue to do so under its regular business tax receipt without the need for an IML. 
q.  The licensee's operating hours for itinerant merchant activities shall be limited to between 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 midnight, inclusive, with the exception that food and beverage vendors may open for business at 7:00 a.m. 
r.  A motor home used in his business by an itinerant merchant may be temporarily parked on the licensed premises during the special event period under the following conditions: 
1.  No such vehicle shall be parked on the front (Ridgewood Ave.) side of the property, unless it can be parked at a setback of 250 feet or more from the street right-of-way. 
2.  All such vehicles shall be parked in designated activity areas so as to avoid occupying space set aside to customer parking, unless the community development department determines, in any specific case, that such an arrangement is not practical. 
3.  No related generators or engines shall be operating after 9:00 p.m. The only exception to engine operation being when the vehicle is being driven from one location to another. 
4.  There shall be no "dumping" from such vehicles. The term "dumping" shall mean the on-site disposal, removal or discharge to the ground of waste or other material from vehicle holding tanks, etc. 
5.  Such vehicles shall only be occupied by persons responsible for guarding and protecting merchandise and displays and their traveling companions. No more than four occupants per motor home shall be allowed. An updated list of these persons shall be maintained by the property-owner and made available to city officials upon request. 
6.  No more than one such motor home per itinerant merchant per property shall be allowed. 
7.  At the time of issuance of the itinerant merchant license, the applicant shall indicate whether or not a motor home is to be parked on the property-if affirmative, the city shall issue a sticker or tag showing that said motor home has been authorized, and the sticker/tag is to be posted on the motor home; the city shall charge a sticker/tag fee of $100.00 for Bikeweek (ten-day event) and $40.00 for Biketoberfest (four-day event) that is in addition to the fee for the IML. 
8.  Any violation of provisions "R.1 through R.7" above shall be grounds for the city to require removal of the motor home. 
s.  Each applicant for an itinerant merchant license shall submit an application which includes: 
i.  Name and address of itinerant merchant and property owner. 
ii.  Signature of itinerant merchant and property-owner. 
iii.  A legible sketch of the site, including the location of activity areas. Any significant on-site deviations from the locations shown on the sketch must be approved by the community development department, otherwise such deviations will constitute sufficient cause for revocation of the IML. 
iv.  Type, size, and location of proposed signage. 
v.  The type of motor home, if any, to be parked on s site, including license tag number. 
vi.  Evidence of registration for sales tax collection for the itinerant merchant covered by the IML. 
vii.  Other information as may be required by the community development director to ensure compliance with this section. 
t.  The permit fee per itinerant merchant license shall be a fixed fee of $400.00. Nonprofit vendors and local businesses selling ordinarily allowed goods/services per the business tax receipt on their own property are exempt from the fee. 
u.  No signs shall be displayed on utility poles or public right-of-way. 
v.  The permittee must comply with all applicable City Codes, including the Sign Code, except that no separate sign permit or sign fee shall be charged. 
w.  Itinerant merchant activities shall only be permitted on properties where an existing retail business facility is in operation under a regular city business tax receipt. 
x.  Vendor installations shall be set back from the U.S. 1 right-of-way line (generally back edge of public street sidewalk) a minimum distance of five feet, except that in instances where the community development director determines that the vendor location is too narrow for a typical vendor setup, a minimum three-foot setback may be allowed. 
y.  Reserved. 
6.  Biketoberfest. Itinerant merchant activities shall be permitted in the fall of each year during a four consecutive day period, as designated by the City Council, for the special area-wide event commonly known as Biketoberfest. The same city regulations which apply to Bikeweek as set forth in subparts 4 and 5 of Part P shall also apply to Biketoberfest, except that the Biketoberfest event period shall be limited to four consecutive days and the itinerant merchant license charged by the city shall be set at $200.00.

b.  Installing an antenna on an existing communication tower of any height, including a pre-existing communication tower, and further including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said antenna, so long as the addition of said antenna adds no more than ten feet to the height of said existing communication tower; 
c.  Locating any alternative tower structure in a zoning district other than single-family residential that in the judgment of the DRC is in conformity with the goals of this section. The alternative tower structure must comply with all applicable zoning and building requirements for the district in which said structure will be constructed. 
3.  Application for administrative approval. 
a.  Each applicant for administrative approval shall apply to the community development department, providing the information required by this section. 
b.  The DRC shall respond to each such application within 30 days after receiving it by either approving or denying the application. If the DRC fails to respond to the applicant within said 30 days, then the application shall be deemed to be approved. 
c.  In connection with any such administrative approval, the DRC may, in order to encourage shared use (co-location), administratively waive any zoning district setback requirements by up to 50 percent. 
d.  If DRC approval is denied, the applicant may appeal said denial to the city council within 30 days of notification of the denial. 
F.  Special use permits-Approval by city council after review by the LDRB. 
1.  General. If the communication tower or antenna is not a permitted use under subsection D. of this section or permitted to be approved administratively pursuant to subsection E. of this section, then a special use permit shall be required for the construction of a communication tower or the placement of an antenna in all zoning districts. A licensed professional engineer must certify that the communication tower can structurally accommodate the number of shared users proposed by the applicant; the city council must conclude that the communication tower is in conformity with the goals of this section; and the communication tower is to be set back from any existing off-site residence and designated emergency evacuation routes a distance equal to at least the height of the communication tower.

3.  Information required. Each applicant requesting a special use permit under this section shall submit to the community development department a scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, communication tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, buffering, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and other information deemed by the city to be necessary to assess compliance with this section. 
4.  Factors considered in granting special use permits. The city council shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a special use permit, although they may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if they conclude that the goals of this section are better served thereby: 
a.  The recommendation of the land development regulation board (LDRB). 
b.  Whether the proposed tower is located on city-owned or controlled property; preference may be given to such locations; 
c.  Whether the proposed tower provides for co-location; preference may be given to co-location proposals; 
d.  Height of the proposed communication tower; 
e.  Proximity of the communication tower to residential structures, residential district boundaries and designated emergency evacuation routes; 
f.  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
g.  Surrounding topography; 
h.  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
i.  Design of the communication tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; monopole type towers are preferred; 
j.  Proposed ingress and egress; and 
k.  Availability of suitable existing communication towers and other structures. No new communication tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city council that no existing communication tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing communication tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
1)  No existing communication towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
2)  Existing communication towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
3)  Existing communication towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing communication towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing communication towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
5)  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing communication tower or structure or to adapt an existing communication tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new communication tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
6)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing communication towers and structures unsuitable. 
7)  The zoning classification of the proposed site, with preference given to nonresidential classifications. 
G.  Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all communication towers and antennas for which a special use permit is required; provided, however, that the city council may reduce the standard setbacks and separation requirements if the goals of this section would be better served thereby. 
1.  Communication towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the communication tower from any off-site residential structure and designated emergency evacuation routes. 
2.  Communication towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
3.  In zoning districts other than industrial or heavy commercial zoning districts, communication towers over 90 feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter of a mile (1,320 feet) from any existing communication tower that is over 90 feet in height.

4.  For communication towers located in planned unit developments (PUDs), the setback requirements for the parcel upon which the communication tower is located shall be as required by the PUD. 
5.  Communication tower separation shall be measured from the base of the communication tower to the closest point of off-site uses and/or designated areas as specified in the table set forth in subsection L. 
6.  Separation distance may be reduced by the city council when notarized written consent is obtained from all affected property owners within the applicable separation distance. 
H.  Security fencing. Communication towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, that the city council may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate. Access to the communication tower shall be through a locked gate. 
I.  Landscaping. The visual impacts of a communication tower shall be mitigated from nearby view through landscaping or other screening materials at the base of the communication tower and ancillary structures. Landscaping shall be installed on the outside of fences. Further, the preservation and use of existing vegetation shall be encouraged and may serve as a substitute for or supplement towards meeting landscaping requirements. 
1.  A row of trees a minimum of eight feet tall and a maximum of ten feet apart shall be planted around the perimeter of the fence. 
2.  A continuous hedge at least 30 inches high at planting capable of growing to at least 36 inches in height within 18 months shall be planted in front of the tree line referenced above. 
3.  All landscaping shall be of the evergreen variety. 
4.  All landscaping shall be xeriscape tolerant or irrigated and properly maintained to ensure good health and viability. 
5.  Any request to deviate from any of the requirements of this section shall require variance approval from the board of adjustments and appeals. 
J.  Engineering certification.

Such certification must be found acceptable by the city prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Subsequent certification will be required as follows: for monopole towers, every five years after initial certification; for lattice and guyed towers, every two years after initial certification. The city shall also have the authority to require more frequent certification if the city has reason to believe that the structural and/or electrical integrity of the tower is jeopardized. City representatives shall have the authority to enter upon the tower site, at such times as the city may deem necessary, for the purpose of inspecting the tower to determine its compliance with construction standards as provided by city, federal and state regulations. The city may conduct such inspections upon reasonable notice to the tower owner. All reasonable expenses related to such inspections by the city shall be charged to the tower owner. 
K.  Removal of abandoned antennas and communication towers. In the event the use of any communication tower has been discontinued for the period of 180 consecutive days, it shall be deemed to be abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the community development director who shall have the right to request documentation and/or affidavits from the electronic transmission tower owner regarding the issue of communication tower usage. Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the communication tower and the owner of the land upon which it is located shall have 90 days within which to dismantle and remove the communication tower or to reactivate it. At the date that the tower is removed, any variance approval for the communication tower shall automatically expire. 
L.  Table of separation distances between towers. The following table shows the minimum required distances between the different types of communication towers; these distance requirements shall be applied in evaluating tower construction proposals:

Sec. 6.3. - Major subdivision requirements. 
A.  Intent. The intent of this section: is to ensure that adequate and necessary physical improvements of lasting quality will be installed; to provide for safe and convenient traffic circulation; to provide an efficient, adequate and economic supply of utilities and services to new land developments; to minimize seasonal flooding through provision of protective flood control and drainage facilities; to help conserve and protect physical, environmental and scenic resources; to promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare; and to implement the city's comprehensive plan. LDRB review is a key element in the major subdivision approval process. 
B.  Minimum requirements. Every major subdivision of land within the city shall include the requirements contained in this section. Such requirements include (subsection F) a concept plan, optional preliminary plat, and required final plat. The requirements contained within these sections shall constitute the minimum requirements, and no omissions of required exhibits shall be permitted without prior approval of the community development director (CDD). 
C.  Additional requirements. 
1.  Where deemed necessary to address special conditions or circumstances, the CDD shall have the authority to require additional exhibits for any concept plan, preliminary plat or final plat. 
2.  Every subdivision shall be required to have two points of access, one of which shall be to a collector street where such a connection is possible. If only one access point is currently possible, a stubout to a future second point of access must be provided. 
3.  Off-site improvements, as defined in Section 6.3.(F).(3) and set forth in the design standards of Article VIII, shall be provided as necessary for the approval of any subdivision proposal. 
D.  Pre-application procedure. 
1.  Purpose: The pre-application stage is offered to afford the subdivider an early opportunity to consult early and informally with the staff and LDRB before preparation of the preliminary and final plats. 
2.  In order to secure approval of a subdivision plan, the following steps must be followed by the developer: 
a.  An initial conference must be held with the CDD to review pertinent regulations, permitting requirements, schedule of fees, concurrency evaluation, and other issues for code compliance. 
b.  Within six months of such meeting, the developer may submit a concept plan containing the information outlined below, for review by the CDD and DRC, who may recommend approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the plan. Should the developer not submit the plan within this time frame, the director may request another meeting to review the project and may, at his discretion, reject the submittal of a concept plan if requirements are not met. 
c.  The CDD will forward the recommendation of the DRC to the land development regulation board which will approve, approve with conditions, or deny the concept plan. If approved, or approved with conditions, the applicant may proceed to the next stage of the process; if denied, the applicant must start the process over. 
d.  The developer then has the option of going from concept to final development plan approval for any type of subdivision. 
E.  Concept plan. 
1.  At this stage, the applicant must submit a location map, showing the relationship of the proposed subdivision to the existing and proposed streets in that vicinity. In addition, the concept plan shall provide the information specified in subsection 2. below. 
2.  General subdivision information, including the following: 
a.  General information on existing site conditions and physical characteristics, adjacent community facilities and public utilities, and surrounding property conditions. Also, on-site environmental conditions including a tree survey, location of major trees, wetlands and water bodies, topography, soil types and any documented sightings of threatened or endangered species as verified by the appropriate state agencies. 
b.  General description of the proposed subdivision, including proposed number of lots, minimum lot width and depth, building sizes and types. 
c.  In simple sketch form, a plan showing existing and proposed topographic contours and the proposed pattern of streets, lots and storm drainage in relation to existing conditions of the site and its surroundings, including major trees and tree clusters to be preserved, and a preliminary estimate of cut and fill requirements. 
d.  Identification of any significant departure from normal demands on available levels-of-service for public facilities and services. 
e.  Any off-site improvements required for project feasibility and necessary for the provision of public facilities/services. 
F.  Preliminary plat. Generally, the developer may elect to whether or not to submit a preliminary plat. A preliminary plat is, however, required for subdivisions which are to be completed in phases. Such plat, if submitted, will contain and be reviewed under the following criteria: 
1.  The developer shall submit the plat to the director (CDD), at least 45 days prior to the next scheduled meeting of the LDRB. He will schedule the plat for review by the DRC.

The provisions of this section shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
3.  Intent. The purposes of this section and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
a.  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
b.  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
c.  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
d.  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
e.  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
f.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
g.  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
h.  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in 44 CFR 59.22. 
4.  Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This section is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
5.  Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this section and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This section does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of 44 CFR 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this section. 
6.  Disclaimer of liability. This section shall not create liability on the part of the City Council of the City of South Daytona or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  Generally. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable. 
2.  Areas to which this section applies. This section shall apply to all flood hazard areas within the City of South Daytona, as established in subsection B.3. 
3.  Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. The Flood Insurance Study for Volusia County and Incorporated Areas dated September 29, 2017, and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this section and shall serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that establish flood hazard areas are on file at the building and zoning office in the Kelly Administration Building, 123 W. Indiana Avenue, DeLand, Florida. 
4.  Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas. To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to subsection E. the floodplain administrator may require submission of additional data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the community indicates that ground elevations: 
a.  Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this section and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
b.  Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 
5.  Other laws. The provisions of this section shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law. 
6.  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This section supersedes any ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances including but not limited to land development regulations, zoning ordinances, stormwater management regulations, or the Florida Building Code. In the event of a conflict between this section and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern. This section shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject to such interests shall also be governed by this section. 
7.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this section, all provisions shall be:

3.  Limitations on authority to grant variances. The board of adjustments and appeals shall base its decisions on variances on technical justifications submitted by applicants, the considerations for issuance in subsection G.7., the conditions of issuance set forth in subsection G.8., and the comments and recommendations of the floodplain administrator and the building official. The board of adjustments and appeals has the right to attach such conditions as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this section. 
4.  Restrictions in floodways. A variance shall not be issued for any proposed development in a floodway if any increase in base flood elevations would result, as evidenced by the applicable analyses and certifications required in subsection E.3. 
5.  Historic buildings. A variance is authorized to be issued for the repair, improvement, or rehabilitation of a historic building that is determined eligible for the exception to the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code, Existing Building, Chapter 11 Historic Buildings, upon a determination that the proposed repair, improvement, or rehabilitation will not preclude the building's continued designation as a historic building and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the building. If the proposed work precludes the building's continued designation as a historic building, a variance shall not be granted and the building and any repair, improvement, and rehabilitation shall be subject to the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
6.  Functionally dependent uses. A variance is authorized to be issued for the construction or substantial improvement necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, as defined in this section, provided the variance meets the requirements of subsection G.4., is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, and all due consideration has been given to use of methods and materials that minimize flood damage during occurrence of the base flood. 
7.  Considerations for issuance of variances. In reviewing requests for variances, the board of adjustments and appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all other applicable provisions of the Florida Building Code, this section, and the following: 
a.  The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or damage; 
b.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
c.  The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners; 
d.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community; 
e.  The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development that are subject to lower risk of flooding or erosion; 
f.  The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
g.  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
h.  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
i.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
j.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
8.  Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
a.  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this section or the required elevation standards; 
b.  Determination by the board of adjustments and appeals that: 
(1)  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
(2)  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
(3)  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
c.  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
d.  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property. 
H.  Violations. 
1.  Violations. Any development that is not within the scope of the Florida Building Code but that is regulated by this section that is performed without an issued permit, that is in conflict with an issued permit, or that does not fully comply with this section, shall be deemed a violation of this section. A building or structure without the documentation of elevation of the lowest floor, other required design certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this section or the Florida Building Code is presumed to be a violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
2.  Authority. For development that is not within the scope of the Florida Building Code but that is regulated by this section and that is determined to be a violation, the floodplain administrator is authorized to serve notices of violation or stop work orders to owners of the property involved, to the owner's agent, or to the person or persons performing the work. 
3.  Unlawful continuance. Any person who shall continue any work after having been served with a notice of violation or a stop work order, except such work as that person is directed to perform to remove or remedy a violation or unsafe condition, shall be subject to penalties as prescribed by law.

a.  It is the responsibility of an applicant to include in the stormwater management plan sufficient information for the city engineer to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the affected areas, the potential and predicted impacts of the proposed activity on community waters, and the effectiveness and acceptability of those measures proposed by the applicant for reducing adverse impacts. The stormwater management plan shall contain maps, charts, graphs, tables, photographs, narrative descriptions and explanations and citations to supporting references, as appropriate, to communicate the information required by this section. The stormwater management plan shall include or be accompanied by a certificate of an engineer who is registered to engage in the practice of engineering under Chapter 471, F.S., or any successor statute, to ensure that the standards of this Code are met. 
b.  The stormwater management plan shall contain the name, address and telephone number of the owner or developer. In addition, the legal description of the property shall be provided, and its location with reference to such landmarks as major waterbodies, adjoining roads, railroads, subdivisions, or towns shall be clearly identified by a map. 
c.  The existing environmental and hydrologic conditions of the site and of receiving waters and wetlands shall be described in detail, along with the proposed alterations to the site and the proposed stormwater management system. Information to be submitted is found in Article III, Preliminary Development Plans. 
3.  Procedures and fees. 
a.  Any person planning a development as defined in this chapter, unless exempted, shall submit a stormwater management plan or an application for waiver to the city manager. 
b.  A permit fee will be collected at the time the stormwater management plan or application for waiver are submitted and will reflect the cost of administration and management of the permitting process. The city council shall establish, by resolution, a prorated fee schedule based upon the relative complexity of the project. The fee schedule may be amended by resolution from time to time by the city council. 
c.  The stormwater management plan shall not be approved unless it clearly indicates that the proposed development will meet the performance standards and the design standards described in this Code, except where a variance has been granted, or where off-site management is granted. 
d.  Approval of the stormwater management plan will expire with the expiration of the building permit, site plan approval or other development order approving construction of the project that the water management plan is to address. Preliminary subdivision plat approval is not sufficient to continue the stormwater management plan approval. 
e.  Plan adherence. The applicant shall be required to adhere strictly to the approved stormwater management plan. Any changes or amendments to the approved plans must be approved by the city engineer. The developer shall provide an "as-built" survey of the stormwater management system as constructed. If the facilities as constructed differ from the approved plan, the developer shall also supply adequate information to determine if the system as constructed meets the requirements of this ordinance. 
f.  No stormwater management plan may be approved without adequate provision for inspection of the property before development activity commences. The applicant shall arrange with the city engineer for scheduling the following inspections: 
[1]  Initial inspection. Prior to approval of the stormwater management plan; 
[2]  Bury inspection. Prior to burial of any underground drainage structure; 
[3]  Erosion control inspection. As necessary to ensure effective control of erosion and sedimentation; and 
[4]  Finish inspection. When all work including installation of all drainage facilities has been completed. 
The city engineer shall inspect the work and shall either approve it or notify the applicant in writing in what respects there has been a failure to comply with the requirements of the approved stormwater management plan. Any portion of the work which does not comply shall be corrected by the applicant or the applicant will be subject to the penalty provisions determined by this Code. As-built plans sealed by a professional engineer shall be tendered to the city upon final inspection and approval. 
g.  Coordination with DEP. All development falling under these regulations shall be required to coordinate with and receive permits from the state department of environmental protection (DEP). The following process shall govern development stormwater permitting. The developer shall: 
[1]  Submit any required changes to a site plan requested by DEP to the city. 
[2]  Submit a copy of the DEP permit along with other required submittals, prior to being issued a development permit. 
[3]  Submit a copy of an engineer's certification upon completion of installation of required stormwater infrastructure. 
4.  Performance standards for stormwater management plans. Stormwater management plans must demonstrate that the proposed development or activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed and maintained to meet each of the following standards: 
a.  Stormwater runoff shall be subjected to best management practice prior to discharge into natural or artificial drainage systems. Best management practice shall mean a practice or combination of practices determined by the city engineer to be the most effective, practical means of preventing or reducing the amount of pollution generated by the project to a level compatible with Florida water quality standards found in Chapter 17-3, F.A.C. The plan must demonstrate compliance with all SJRWMD requirements. No construction shall be authorized until an MSW permit is approved and given to the city. 
[1]  No site alteration shall cause siltation of wetlands, pollution of downstream wetlands or reduce the natural retention or filtering capabilities of wetlands. 
No site alteration shall allow water to become a health hazard or contribute to the breeding of mosquitos. 
All site alternation activities shall provide for such water retention and settling structures and flow attenuation devices as may be necessary to insure that the foregoing standards and requirements are met. 
[2]  Design of water retention or detention structures and flow attenuation devices shall be subject to the approval of the city engineer pursuant to the standards hereof. Detention structures shall be designed to release runoff to the downstream drainage system over a period of time so as not to exceed the capacity of the existing downstream system. Under no case shall open retention areas (ponds, etc.) have side slopes steeper than one vertical to four horizontal. 
In order to maintain good water quality in stormwater management detention ponds and maximize the provision of fish and wildlife habitat, stormwater management systems with permanently wet detention ponds should be designed, operated and maintained so as to resemble a natural pond to the greatest extent practicable. A natural pond design should include: a littoral zone comprised of native emergent and submerged aquatic macrophytic vegetation; a deep open water limnetic zone free of rooted emergent and submerged vegetation; and where feasible, an upland buffer of native trees, shrubs and understory vegetation. 
[3]  A positive drainage system shall be provided which will not adversely impact downstream owners or adjacent lands. 
[4]  Where possible, natural vegetation shall be used as a component of the drainage system. The water table should not be manipulated so as to endanger natural vegetation beneficial to water quality unless natural vegetation can be replanted and survive with a lowered water table condition. 
[5]  Runoff from higher adjacent lands shall be considered and provisions for conveyance of such runoff shall be included in the drainage plan. 
[6]  Runoff shall be treated to remove oil and floatable solids before discharge from the site in a manner approved by the city engineer. 
[7]  Erosion by wind or water shall be prevented by the developer throughout the construction process. 
[8]  Direct discharge to Class II waters is prohibited. A workable filter system must be provided prior to any discharge to Class II waters. 
[9]  For the purpose of this section, it is presumed that the lowering of the water table for the purpose of constructing detention/retention basins and for the purpose of permanently protecting road construction does not conflict with the stated objectives of this section if all of the following are met: 
[a]  The development site is not in an area known to the city, based on data collected and interpreted by the U.S. Geological Survey, the St. Johns River Water Management District, the County and other professional investigators, as important to recharge or to prevention of discharge of the Floridian aquifer. 
[b]  The proposed lowering of the water table shall be over no more than 15 percent of the site to a depth of five feet below the surface of the existing undisturbed ground, or an equivalent volume, said area to be measured at the overflow elevation of the retention area(s). 
[c]  If ditches, underdrains or similar devices are used to lower the water table, the lateral volumetric effect will be calculated, and the volume will be deducted from that allowed for retention areas. 
[d]  The high water table may be lowered up to two feet below the undisturbed ground in the vicinity of roads for the purpose of protecting the sub-base and base of the roadway and/or for the purpose of preventing mosquito breeding in the roadside swales. 
[e]  The lowering of the water table has no adverse affect on wetlands as defined herein. 
[f]  The lowering of the water table does not increase flows to the detriment of neighboring lands. 
b.  The volume of retention to be provided by the stormwater management plan shall be equivalent to one- half inch of depth over the entire project area, or the volume determined by the design procedures set forth herein, whichever is greater. For certain soil conditions or ground water table conditions which do not permit the percolation of this volume within the five days following a storm event, the city engineer may approve detention with filtration systems in lieu of retention. 
[1]  The surface storage volume provided must equal or exceed the required storage volume with no allowance for volume recovered during a storm event, unless an exfiltration system is used. 
[2]  Soil borings shall be required for each subdivision, commercial and industrial site for determination of the existing and estimated seasonal high water table. At the request of the city engineer, additional soil borings and permeability tests may also be required. 
c.  The following performance standards are to be followed in the design of the project: 
[1]  The discharge hydrograph produced for the developed or redeveloped site shall not exceed, in terms of peak flow and total volume, the hydrograph produced by conditions existing before development or redevelopment for a 24 hour, 25 year frequency storm, unless the intent of this recharge provision will be met through detention of the difference between said volumes, in which case said volume difference may be released over not less than a 24 hour nor greater than a 72-hour period of time. However, the design standards for wet retention areas, when approved by the city engineer shall prevail. This requirement may be waived by the city engineer for sites consisting predominately of poorly drained soils having permanently and naturally impaired recharge potentials. However, the runoff from the first one inch of rainfall for each storm falling on all areas of the project shall be retained on-site except in cases where the city engineer concurs that soil and/or ground water table conditions are not conducive to such practice, in which case said first inch shall be detained and released over a period of 24 to 72 hours, in a manner acceptable to the city engineer. However, in the case of wet detention, standards approved by the city engineer shall prevail. In addition, the cumulative impact of the outflow hydrograph on downstream flow shall be considered. Runoff rates and volumes resulting from the project, in excess of existing amounts, shall be accommodated on-site. Offsite retention may be permitted if, in the opinion of the city engineer, the recharge requirements of this section are met. 
[2]  Peak discharge - 100-year storm. The peak discharge resulting from a 24-hour, 100-year frequency storm on the developed or redeveloped site shall not exceed the peak discharge resulting from a 100-year frequency storm for existing conditions on the site. 
[3]  Runoff conditions. Runoff conditions shall be based on the most critical situation (rainfall duration, distribution and antecedent soil moisture condition) and conform to acceptable engineering practices using rainfall data and other local information applicable to the affected area. 
5.  Review standards. The city engineer in reviewing and/or approving the application shall consider, where appropriate, the following minimum standards: 
a.  The characteristics and limitations of the soil at the proposed site with respect to percolation and infiltration; 
b.  The existing topography of the site and the extent of topographical changes after development; 
c.  The existing vegetation of the site, the extent of vegetational changes after development and the threat posed to vegetation endangered or indigenous wetlands; 
d.  The plans and specifications of structures or devices the applicant intends to employ for on-site stormwater retention/detention with filtration, erosion control and flow attenuation; 
e.  The effect the proposed stormwater management system will have upon mosquito breeding habitat; 
f.  The adequacy of easements for drainage systems in terms of both runoff conveyance and maintenance; 
g.  The method of handling upland flow which presently discharges through the site; 
h.  The effectiveness of wind and water erosion control measures during construction; 
i.  Standards and requirements of any other governmental jurisdiction; 
j.  The maintenance entity responsible for upkeep of the system upon its completion; 
k.  The continuity of phased projects. Phased projects will require the submission of an overall plan for the applicant's total land holdings; 
l.  The existing hydrologic cycle of the proposed site and the impact of the proposed alterations on the existing hydrologic cycle; 
m.  The impact the proposed project will have on the natural recharge capabilities of the site; and 
n.  The impact the proposed project will have on downstream water quantity and quality and specifically the potential for downstream flooding conditions. 
6.  Design standards for stormwater management plans. To ensure attainment of the objectives of this section and to ensure that performance standards will be met, the design, construction and maintenance of drainage systems shall be consistent with the following standards: 
a.  Open swales, ditches, or other waterways shall require complete engineering data showing the adequacy of design and the effect within the particular drainage area to the satisfaction of the city engineer. The cost of designing and installing drainage systems shall be borne by the developer. 
b.  Pipe shall be either reinforced concrete with patented rubber gasketed joints, elliptical concrete pipe or other type approved the city engineer. 
c.  A pipe shall extend through headwalls and drainage inlets flush with the surface of the wall. All surfaces shall be plastered so as to prevent leakage. Waterstop materials are recommended. Plastered areas should not crack and should be properly prepared to bond to old surfaces. Paved inserts are required. 
For all concrete structures, all fins and irregular projections shall be chipped off flush with the surface immediately following the removal of forms. All projecting wires and nails shall be cut off at least one-half inch under the surface. All cavities produced by metal spacers, form ties, bolts, honeycomb spots, etc., shall be carefully cleaned, saturated with water, and then carefully painted with mortar and concrete. Joint filler shall be left exposed for its full length with clean edges. Mortar topping for upper horizontal surfaces shall not be used. 
For all concrete surfaces which are to receive a surface finish, the contractor shall review the forms and finish the concrete immediately after the concrete has set sufficiently. Minimum manhole diameters for intersecting pipe sizes shall be as follows: 
Equivalent 
Pipe Diameter Inside Diameter Up to 27" 4'0" 27" to 36" 5'0" 42" 6'0" 48" and Larger Special Design  
Inlets shall be spaced in such a manner as to accept 100 percent of the design runoff. The actual required spacing will depend on the characteristics of each particular site. 
Sizes of drainage culverts, ditch sizes, and inlet spacings shall be derived from computations required by the city engineer and shall be submitted to him for approval. 
d.  In cases where there is a prevalence of soils that exhibit adverse water table characteristics, underdrains and/or fill or other acceptable alternatives that will provide necessary measures to maintain the structural integrity of the road will be required. The determination of need shall be made by reference to applicable portions of the most recent edition of the Soil Survey and Supplement for Volusia County, Florida, as prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, or whatever subsequent authoritative soil survey may be published for Volusia County after adoption of these regulations, or according to information generated by developers. 
[1]  Wherever road construction or lot development is planned in areas of the proposed development having soil types with unacceptable water table characteristics, underdrains and/or fill shall be provided and shown on the engineering plans. Underdrains must be designed with free gravity outlet at carefully selected discharge points. Erosion control measures shall be provided as needed at all discharge points. 
[2]  Wherever road cuts in otherwise suitable soils indicate that the finish grade will result in a road-surface-to-water-table relationship that adversely exceeds the degree of limitation stated above, underdrains or other acceptable alternative that will provide necessary measures to maintain the structural integrity of the road will be required. 
[3]  Wherever roadway construction reveals unexpected water bearing strata that would cause deterioration of the pavement, underdrains or other acceptable alternative that will provide necessary measures to maintain the structural integrity of the road will be required even through not shown on the plans. 
[4]  Filtering media shall consist of stone, gravel, or slag and shall contain no friable materials. 
[5]  Wherever underdrain pipe is required, the specifications shall be in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials, Designation: D3033-5.

In addition, the cost of obtaining and installing such drainage rights-of-way and structures shall be the responsibility of the developer. 
4.  Adverse environmental impacts on the site development will be minimized. 
E.  Maintenance. 
1.  Drainage facilities may be dedicated to the City of South Daytona where they are determined to be appropriately a part of the city-maintained regional system. 
2.  The systems maintained by the owner shall have adequate easements to permit the city engineer to inspect and, if necessary, to take corrective action should the owner fail to properly maintain the system. Before taking corrective action, the city engineer shall give the owner written notice of the nature of the existing defects. If the owner fails within 30 days from the date of notice to commence corrective action or to appeal the matter to the South Daytona Board of Adjustments and Appeals, the city engineer may take necessary corrective action, the cost of which shall become a lien on the property until paid. 
3.  Maintenance of retention ponds, drainage systems, and other stormwater management facilities on private property: 
(a)  It is the responsibility of the private property owner to properly maintain private stormwater management facilities on the private property.

b.  The county council shall declare a water shortage or water shortage emergency based on public concern and technical information, such as, but not limited to, groundwater levels, spring flows and rainfall, and shall establish a specific level of water conservation and use, and may consider the level of water conservation and use recommended by the Volusian Water Alliance. 
c.  In the event the St. Johns River Water Management District declares a water shortage and implements its water shortage plan, 40C-21, Florida Administrative Code, the water shortage plan and all elements of said plan become effective and take precedence over the provision of this division, provided that the plan provides for a more restrictive level of water conservation than the level in effect. At such time as the declared St. Johns River Water Management District water shortage expires, then all provisions of this division become effective and enforceable. 
4.  Levels of water conservation and water shortage. In order to provide the necessary levels of year-round water conservation and provide for the most logical transition to a declared water shortage, water shortage emergency or the St. Johns River Water Management District Water Shortage Plan, the following levels of water conservation and use shall be established: 
a.  Base water conservation level. This level is as follows: 
(1)  The use of water for landscape irrigation is allowed only during the following times: Three days a week from 4:00 a.m. 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. 8:00 p.m. (5:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m. during daylight savings time) for manual irrigation systems and 4:00 a.m. 8:00 a.m. only for automatic irrigation systems. Even numbered addresses and residences without address numbers may water at these times on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays, odd numbered addresses on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. On Fridays no watering is permitted. 
a.  The use of water for irrigation from a reclaimed water system is allowed anytime provided appropriate signs are placed on the property to inform the general public and district enforcement personnel of such use. For the purpose of this paragraph, a reclaimed water system includes systems in which the primary source is reclaimed water, which may or may not be supplemented by water from another source during peak demand periods. Additional restrictions may be placed on reclaimed water by the city as long as these restrictions are more stringent than those of the district. 
b.  Irrigation of new landscape plantings is allowed any day, except between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., for one thirty-day period, provided irrigation is limited to the amount necessary for plant establishment. 
c.  Watering-in of chemicals, including insecticides, pesticides, fertilizers, fungicides, and herbicides when required by law, the manufacturer, or best management practices, is allowed anytime within twenty-four (24) hours of application. 
d.  Irrigation systems may be operated anytime for maintenance and repair purposes not to exceed ten (10) minutes per hour per zone. 
(2)  Excessive use of water for landscape irrigation or overwatering of landscaping is discouraged. Overspray of irrigation water onto impervious surfaces is prohibited. 
(3)  Mobile equipment washing shall utilize an automatic shutoff/self-canceling spray nozzle. Mobile equipment washing shall be on pervious surfaces whenever feasible or at a commercial water recycling automobile wash.

1.  Classification of streets. Streets or roads shall be classified as arterial, major collector, minor collector or local roads according to the designations in the traffic circulation element of the comprehensive plan. 
2.  Access control. The following regulations are established to promote the safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, minimize traffic congestion, promote roadside aesthetics and enhance the functional capacity of roads and highways within the city. 
It is the intent of these regulations to allow the minimum number of access points to adequately serve each parcel of land. On corner properties, access should be provided from the lower classification of street. These regulations shall be in addition to those imposed by the Florida Department of Transportation on roads under their jurisdiction. Where recorded cross-access easements exist, all properties with cross-access shall be considered as one parcel under the provisions of this section. 
a.  Number of entrances. Any property with a minimum of 25 feet frontage on a public street may install one two-way access drive. A parcel may have two access aisles if the minimum frontage as set forth on the following table is met:

e.  Obstruction to vision at road intersections. In order to minimize accidents caused by obstruction to vision at road intersections, the following regulations shall apply to all residential districts: 
[1]  Within the area formed by the rights-of-way lines of intersection roads, and a straight line at a distance of 30 feet from their point of intersection, such connecting line extending beyond the points to the curb lines, there shall be a clear space with no obstruction to vision between the height of three feet and the height of eight feet above the average grade of each road as measured at the centerline thereof. 
[2]  The requirements of this section shall not be deemed to prohibit any necessary retaining wall. 
[3]  Trees shall be permitted in the clear space provided that foliage is cut away within the prescribed heights. 
[4]  Lamp posts and street name sign posts shall also be permitted, provided that illuminating fixtures or name plates are not within the prescribed clear space. 
f.  Variances from this section. Where the city engineer and the community development director concur that unique traffic engineering considerations exist on a specific site, variances from this section may be administratively granted through the site plan review process, or at the time of building permit application for one- and two-family residences. However, if either the city engineer or the community development director objects to a proposed variance from this section, a variance request shall be formally presented to the board of adjustments and appeals. 

g.  Rights of way/pavement width. 
[1]  Required development along any roadway in the city shall be required to dedicate right-of-way per these standards.

[2]  Streets in proposed subdivisions shall be connected to rights-of-way in adjacent areas to allow for proper inter-neighborhood traffic flow. All roads shall be extended at equal or greater width, but in no case less than the required width. If adjacent lands are unplatted, stub-outs in the new development shall be provided for future connection to the adjacent unplatted land to include reserved right-of-way upon future road construction. 
h.  Easement or public access. Any parcel of property must have a 25-foot publicly dedicated access in order to be eligible for a development permit. 
3.  Limited-use service drives. The provisions of this section shall not generally apply to limited-use service drives. Dimensions regarding this type of drive shall be based on the specific traffic safety considerations of the location and proposed use of the drive. 
4.  Abandoned vehicles. Within all zoning districts, all vehicles which are inoperative or unlicensed for a period of 30 days shall be prohibited on any public right-of-way or on private property except within a completely enclosed garage. 
5.  Abandoned watercraft. 
a.  Within all zoning districts, all watercraft which are inoperative or unlicensed and appear to be in a state of decay or abandonment as determined by the administrative official shall be prohibited on any waterway, shore, private or public property unless contained within a completely enclosed building. 
b.  Dilapidated or inoperable boats. 
[1]  It shall be unlawful for any person to place or abandon any dilapidated or inoperable boat or watercraft in the public waterways within the city, or to moor the same in such a manner as to cause such boat or watercraft to be or to potentially become a menace to navigation, public health, safety or aesthetics. 
[2]  No dilapidated or inoperable boat or watercraft of any kind whatsoever shall be permitted to moor or tie up or otherwise be stopped or allowed to drift at any place in the public waterways of the city when such vessel is likely to damage docks or otherwise become a menace to navigation, public welfare or the aesthetics of the city. Boats or other watercraft in such condition are hereby declared to be a public nuisance. 
[3]  The city manager or his designee shall determine whether any boat or watercraft is of such unsightly appearance or in deteriorated condition or constitutes a hazard to public health, safety and welfare so as to constitute a public nuisance, and if so determined, to abate the public nuisance created thereby. In the event the city manager or his designee makes such a finding, the boat or watercraft shall be posted with a notice to owner indicating said finding and providing a five-day time period for the owner of the boat to remove it from the public waterways of the city. 
If the dilapidated or inoperable boat or other watercraft is not moved out of the public waterways of the city within five days of posting, the city manager or his designee is authorized to take possession of the vessel and remove it to a secure location. All costs of towing and storage shall become a lien on the vessel, and it shall not be released to its owner until all costs of towing and storage are paid. 
If, within 14 days of removal by the city, the owner of the dilapidated boat or other watercraft has not notified the city in writing of his intention to reclaim the vessel and tendered payment for all costs of towing and storage, the city manager is hereby authorized to advertise the vessel for sale to the highest bidder. The advertisement for sale shall be published one time only, no sooner then ten days before the sale, in a newspaper of local circulation. If there are not any bids equal to the cost of towing, storage, advertising and sale of the vessel, the city may enter its own bid for the vessel and take possession of it for disposal in a safe manner. 
If the dilapidated boat or other watercraft is sold at auction, the proceeds of sale shall go first toward costs of towing, storage, advertising and sale. Any monies left thereafter shall be paid to the record owner of the vessel. 
[4]  The owner of the dilapidated boat or other watercraft may appeal the decision of the city manager to the city council. A condition precedent to the filing of the appeal shall be the posting of a bond equal to the cost of towing and storing the vessel until the city council may consider the appeal. No appeal shall be considered, unless the required bond is paid in advance. 
B.  Parking control. 
1.  Parking and loading. Provision of off-street parking areas is required for all uses in all zoning districts. Provision of off-street loading area is required for all industrial, commercial and residential uses over the minimum size prescribed by this section. Required off-street parking areas and off-street loading areas shall be located on-site and designed to function independently of each other allowing simultaneous use. Off-street parking areas shall be a hard surface as may be approved by the city engineer. All off-street parking and loading areas shall be designed in accordance with this section. 
2.  Minimum required number of off-street parking spaces. The minimum number of required off-street parking spaces shall be determined from the following table. Requirements for any use not specifically listed shall be determined by city council based upon information provided by the applicant or city staff, in the case of unique facilities. 
a.  Rules of interpretation: Where application of these requirements results in a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or more shall require an additional space. Where seating is provided on benches, pews or other indeterminate facilities, each 24 linear inches shall be counted as one seat. All square footage requirements refer to gross area, except as noted otherwise. Public areas shall refer to gross area less storage, maintenance, office and rest room areas. Where a non-retail building contains two or more different types of use, i.e., warehouse and office, the parking may be based on separate calculations for each use. 
b.  Review of parking: Parking will initially be reviewed when the development plans are submitted for approval. The required parking will be based on the minimum parking required based on the permitted uses within the zoning category, unless the developer specifies a particular use, in which case the required parking will be based on the use identified. Parking will again be reviewed each time a business tax receipt is requested. A business tax receipt will not be issued if there is not sufficient available parking spaces for the proposed use, unless the site qualifies as a grandfathered non-conformity. Available parking spaces are parking spaces that have not been officially reserved for other uses or unit and spaces that have not be used to determine sufficient parking for other uses. The same parking space cannot be used to satisfy the parking requirements for more than one use at a time. 
c.  Non-residential condominiums: Development plans for non-residential condominiums shall reserve parking spaces for each condominium unit sufficient to meet the minimum parking requirement for any permitted use in the zoning classification, unless the developer designates a specific use for a particular condominium unit, in which case the required reserved parking shall be based on the use identified. Reserved parking spaces shall not be used to meet a parking requirement of a proposed use in another condominium unit even if said condominium unit is vacant. 
d.  The community development director shall have the authority to work with the developer/owner to modify the operations of the proposed use to meet the parking requirements. The operational modification must be reflected in an operational agreement approved by the city attorney and city manager and recorded by the developer/owner in public records so that it is binding on successors, heirs and assigns of the developed property. However, the community development director does not have the authority to approve a development or use that does not meet the required minimum parking for the proposed use.

(Ord. No. 04-19, § 1, 8-10-04; Ord. No. 07-03, § 1, 2-13-07; Ord. No. 12-09, § 3, 9-10-12; Ord. No. 15-01 , § 1, 2-24-15) 
Sec. 7.6. - Environmentally sensitive lands. 
A.  Purpose. This article sets forth regulations to: protect the city's natural and manmade resources from the effects of land development; protect soils and groundwater from harmful pollutants; prevent erosion of shorelines; conserve and promote fisheries, vegetative communities and wildlife habitats; reduce flood hazards, including harmful effects from trees and high water storm surges; and conserve areas of unique historical or archaeological interest. 
    As such, these regulations supplement the requirements of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP),and the St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD). In the event of conflict between state requirements and requirements of this article, the most stringent requirement shall apply. 
B.  Wetlands protection. The city has adopted wetlands standards from Ordinance No. 8-15, Volusia County Minimum Standards for Environmental Protection. Those provisions are hereby incorporated into the SDLDR's by reference. The area of impact is defined as the lands fronting along the Halifax River and extending landward 25 feet. 
C.  Protection of historical or archaeologically significant properties. In the event that historical or archaeologically significant areas are someday identified, best management practices, state, and generally accepted professional standards shall govern actions at such sites. Development of such sites shall not be undertaken until a study has been prepared which identifies the: 
1.  Affected buildings/sites. 
2.  Potential significance. 
3.  Means of recordation and documentation. 
4.  Methods of protection before, during, and after construction. 
5.  Site management plans. 
D.  Habitat and endangered/threatened species protection. 
1.  Applicability. This section shall be interpreted to include both flora and fauna. 
2.  Standards for development. 
a.  Areas subject to the standards of this section shall be those identified in the conservation element of the comprehensive plan as habitat for rare and endangered species, threatened species, or species of special concern. 
b.  It is the intent of this section to require that an appropriate amount of land shall be set aside to protect habitat of rare, endangered or special concern plant and animal species. Development proposed in areas which have been identified pursuant to paragraph a. above shall be required to provide a professionally prepared study to document the presence of affected species, the land needs of the species which may be met on the development site, and to propose appropriate habitat management plans. 
c.  Where land on a proposed development site is to be preserved as habitat of rare, endangered or special concern species, such land shall be adjacent to existing viable habitat, a significant wetland system, floodplain, or wildlife corridor. If such lands are not adjacent to the development site, land to be set aside shall be of such quantity and quality as to provide viable habitat, as documented in the study required in paragraph b. above. 
d.  As an alternative to preservation of land, the city may establish and maintain a non-lapsing trust fund for the purpose of receiving funds deposits by a developer in an amount equal to or greater than the proportional share of the entire development site. The Volusia County Property Appraiser's current assessed value of the land shall be assumed to be the value in the absence of better evidence of value. Funds deposited in the trust fund shall be used solely in connection with acquiring substitute land or for activities intended to protect habitats of threatened and endangered species. 
E.  Tree protection. 
1.  Purpose. The purpose is to recognize that trees are proven producers of oxygen; that trees reduce the ever-increasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content in the air and serve a vital function in purifying the air; that trees precipitate dust and other particulate air-borne pollutants to settle on the ground; that trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air; that trees have an important role in neutralizing wastewater passing through the ground from the surface to groundwater tables and lower aquifers; that trees, through their root systems, stabilize the groundwater table and play an important part in community-wide soil conservation, erosion control, and flood control; that trees are an invaluable physical and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting, making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land, reducing noise levels and glare, and breaking the monotony of developments on the land; that the city council has determined that the protection of trees within the City of South Daytona is not only desirable but essential to the present and future health, safety, and welfare of all the citizens, present and future, and has further found that this requirement is so imperative that the public interest requires that the city proceed regardless of the difficulties which may arise in the administration and enforcement of this chapter to protect present trees and to encourage the propagation of trees in the future; and that the city council recognizes that some trees are more beneficial than others as necessary contributions to the city's environment, and that it is not necessary to protect each and every tree in order to attain the publicly beneficial results of a tree protection ordinance. 
2.  Intent. Trees as defined and their removal regulated herein, are declared to provide and/or maintain beneficial public resources, and it is the intent of the city council to protect them as herein set out in the interest of the health, safety, and welfare of present and future citizens. In addition, it is further intended to provide through provisions contained herein, adequate tree numbers and canopy to maintain the economic and social status of South Daytona. To that end, it shall be unlawful to cut down, damage, poison, or in any other manner, destroy or cause to be destroyed any trees as covered by the terms of this chapter, except in accordance with the provisions herein. 
3.  Areas of application. The terms and provisions of this article shall apply to real property as follows: 
a.  Land clearing. On any platted, unplatted or undeveloped land, it shall be unlawful for any person to remove or cause to be removed, any tree with a trunk diameter of six inches or more, measured at DBH, without first having obtained a permit to do so. 
b.  Mangrove trees. All species, commonly known as "mangroves", including the following species: 
Rhizophora mangle - Red Mangrove 
Avicennia germinans - Black Mangrove 
Laguncularia Racemosa - White Mangrove

of whatever size or species, are recognized to be of special ecological value. No mangrove tree shall be removed or altered without permission given under the terms and conditions of the Volusia County Environmental Standards. 
c.  Specimen and historic trees. All real property upon which specimen and/or historic trees are located, trees having been designated as such under the provisions of this article, shall be maintained in a living condition. 
4.  Application for permit. 
a.  Any person wishing to remove or relocate a tree or clear land/or grub land as required under the provisions of this article shall submit a site plan for the lot or parcel to be reviewed and approved by the city manager. The site plan shall show the information required in Article III at scale sufficient to enable the determination of matters required under these regulations. 
b.  Land clearing and/or grubbing. Land clearing shall be permitted within designated road rights-of-way, drainage, and other utility areas as depicted upon an approved preliminary site plan, or subdivision plat, after submittal of a tree survey. Information as to the general number, species and size of the protected trees on the property shall be indicated thereon. During authorized grubbing, all trees will be left in an undisturbed condition with no less than the area defined. 
c.  Alternate site plan information. In the event that there are no trees or vegetative cover located on the site to be developed which are required to be protected under the provisions of this section, the applicant shall so state on the site plan. If such statement is substantiated by a site by the city manager or designee the applicant shall be relieved of the necessity of supplying unnecessary or unimportant information such as as topographic survey, etc. 
d.  Time of permit. Any and all permits by the city required by this section shall be declared null and void if commencement of work so permitted is not started within a reasonable time, not to exceed six months. 
5.  Inspection. All tree removal applications shall be field checked. No tree removal permit will be approved without final site plan approval of the project except in the case of a land clearing or grubbing permit as defined herein.

6.  Criteria. Upon receiving the field inspection report and any requested recommendations concerning the application, the city manager or his designee shall issue a permit after application is filed with the building department, for the removal or relocation of tree(s) and/or clearing, if one or more of the following conditions exist: 
a.  Criteria for removal. 
[1]  If the tree if located in an area where a structure or improvements may be placed according to an approved plan and it unreasonably restricts the economic enjoyment of the property, and the tree cannot be relocated on or off the site because of age, type, or size of the tree. 
[2]  The tree is diseased, injured, in danger of falling, too close to existing or proposed structures, interferences with existing utility services, creates unsafe vision clearance or conflicts with other ordinances or regulations. 
[3]  It is in the welfare of the general public or citizen, that the tree be removed for a reason(s) other than set forth above. 
[4]  Notwithstanding the other criteria set forth in this paragraph, the tree species commonly known as "Southern Yellow Pine" (pinus palustris) and "Hackberry" (celtis occidentalis) may be removed from already developed property for any good reason provided that replacement hardwood trees are planted on-site at the basic ratio of one replacement tree for each two trees removed unless staff determines that fewer replacement trees should be required due to such factors as limited planting space or the remaining presence of numerous other trees. 
b.  Professional evaluations. The city manager shall consider significant adverse impact in the following areas on the urban and material environment in granting a permit: 
[1]  Ground and surface water stabilization - whether the removal of tree(s) will substantially alter the water table adversely regarding water assimilation by vegetation, transpiration, and the interception of solar radiation as its affects the evaporation potential of associated soils and bodies of water. 
[2]  Water quality and/or aquifer recharge - whether the removal of tree(s) will lessen the ability for the natural assimilation of nutrients, chemical pollutants, heavy metals, silt and other noxious substances from ground and surface water. 
[3]  Ecological impacts - whether the removal of tree(s) will have an adverse impact upon existing biological and ecological systems, micro-climatic conditions which directly affect these systems, or whether such removals will create conditions which may adversely affect the dynamic equilibrium of associated systems. 
[4]  Noise pollution - whether the removal of tree(s) will significantly increase ambient noise levels to the degree that a nuisance is anticipated to occur or that a violation of the South Daytona Noise Ordinance is anticipated to occur. 
[5]  Air movement - whether the removal of tree(s) will significantly reduce the ability of the existing vegetation to reduce wind velocities to the degree that a nuisance is anticipated to occur. 
[6]  Air quality - whether the removal of tree(s) will significantly affect the natural clearing of the atmosphere by vegetation through particulate matter interception, the ingestion of oxygen released to the atmosphere as a by-product of photosynthesis. 
[7]  Wildlife habitat - whether the removal of tree(s) will significantly reduce available habitat for wildlife existence and reproduction or result in the emigration of wildlife from adjacent or associated ecosystem. 
[8]  Aesthetic degradation - whether the removal of tree(s) will have an adverse affect on property values in the neighborhood where the applicant's property is located. 
c.  Basis for denial. The city manager, upon a determination that an application is to be denied, shall state the basis for such denial specifically and shall notify the applicant of the criteria upon which the denial is predicated. 
7.  Relocation or replacement. 
a.  Conditions. As a condition of the granting of a permit, the applicant shall be required, where practical, to replace in the priority outlined below: 
[1]  Replace on-site. 
[2]  Replace off-site at a designated area approved by the city. 
[3]  Pay into the city's tree replacement fund. The CDD will determine the value of payment based upon the cost of a typical shade tree with the required caliper as defined herein. 
The replacement(s) shall have at least equal shade potential and other characteristics comparable to that of the trees being removed and shall be a minimum of nine feet high at time of planting and Florida Department of Agriculture Nursery Grade #1 or better. Along major streets, a minimum of two street trees will be required to be placed in accordance with the city's streetscape plan and landscaping requirements. 
b.  Replacement trees. For all single-family and duplex lots, a minimum number trees will be required based on the following square footage areas. For all other lots, one tree shall be required for each 2,500 square feet of lot area (rounded to the nearest whole number). Any removal of tree(s) will require that up to this minimum number be replaced. Any tree(s) left in a good growing condition on this site shall be counted toward these minimum numbers. Selection of trees to be planted, their number and species, shall be determined by analysis of tree canopy and soil conditions. 
Lot Size (sq.ft.) Min. No. Trees 3,500-6,000 ..... 2 6,001-9,500 ..... 4 9,501-16,000 ..... 4 Over 16,000 (per 16,000 sq. ft. unit) ..... 8  
c.  Tree bank. Where a tree(s) is (are) to be removed under the provisions of this chapter, the city shall have the option, with the owner's permission, to relocate the tree(s) (not being relocated within the property) at the city's expense to city-owned property for replanting, either for permanent utilization at a new location, or for future use at other city property. The relocation shall be accomplished within 15 working days of the issuance of a permit, unless it is necessary to root prune the tree(s) to assure survival, in which case, the relocation shall be accomplished within 30 working days of the issuance of a permit or other suitable schedule as agreed to by all parties.

(Ord. No. 99-05, § 1, 5-11-99) 
Sec. 7.7. - Undergrounding of electric, cable and telephone lines. 
(A)  The general policy of the city is to require underground installation of electric, cable and telephone lines (utilities) to the greatest extent feasible, in order to assure public safety, foster tree preservation and protect the general aesthetic character of the city. 
(B)  Except as provided herein, all utility lines and services, with the exception of temporary construction lines, shall be installed underground at the owner's, developer's or builder's expense. This policy shall specifically apply to all cables, conduits or wires forming part of an electrical distribution system, including service lines to individual properties necessary to serve new development, or existing development where new or upgraded service is being installed. Underground installation shall not be required for: 
(1)  Electric transmission lines. Those lines that transmit electricity between generating stations and substations. 
(2)  Electric feeder lines. Those lines that transmit electricity between substations and individual subdivisions and projects. The installation of new feeder lines will be coordinated between the city and the utility company. 
(3)  Appurtenances, such as transformers, pedestal-mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets, when placed on a level concrete slab and located so as to minimize noise effects on surrounding properties. 
(4)  Lines serving interim land uses, such as agricultural use of land designated for future urban development. 
(5)  Replacement of existing overhead service lines, where no other site improvements are required due to expansion or change of use. 
(6)  Replacement of lines on existing poles. 
(7)  Service to individual residential lots in developed areas of the city presently served by overhead utility lines. 
(C)  Waiver of underground installation requirement. Underground installation that would be required above may be waived as part of final site plan or subdivision approval, when established, existing and extraordinary physical conditions and distances, service demands, or other site planning requirements, result in economic impact or other circumstances that justify relief from this requirement. Such waiver is conditioned on the following: 
(1)  The proposed overhead route does not contain trees of over 12 inches in diameter. 
(2)  The proposed overhead route is not within and parallel to an existing or future required buffer between differing land uses, and does not conflict with required tree preservation or landscape installations. 
(3)  The proposed overhead route is designed so as to minimize its visibility from off-site public areas. 
(4)  Overhead routes along arterial or collector roads shall be discouraged. However, if such a route is required, poles shall be located so as to accommodate necessary street lighting. 
(5)  Due to the unique characteristics of electric power distribution, waivers for overhead power shall not automatically allow the installation of other utility lines. Parallel requests for such waivers shall be considered separately. 
(6)  The cost differential between underground installation and overhead installation shall not be considered as the sole reason for waiver or installation. 
(7)  All waivers shall be conditioned upon payment to the city of a negotiated sum of money, with the main factor in determining the sum of money to be paid being the estimated cost of undergrounding. All payments received by the city shall be deposited into a separate fund to be used for undergrounding projects in the city. 
(D)  Approval of overhead line and service routes. Waivers may be requested as part of the application for final subdivision or site plan approval, or building permit. The following information shall be submitted as part of the application: 
(1)  A letter requesting the waiver, providing written justification for the granting of a waiver, including documentation from utility companies, contractors, or engineers to verify cost estimates or service demands. 
(2)  A map or engineering drawing showing the route of the proposed lines, and existing or proposed easements covering the route. 
(3)  A survey or drawing showing trees that must be removed or substantially pruned to allow the proposed construction. 
(4)  Drawings showing the relationship of the proposed line to existing and proposed lots, buildings, landscaping, streets and other improvements. This may be reflected in typical details where appropriate. 
(5)  A drawing showing the construction detail of proposed lines and poles, including dimensions and materials.

ARTICLE VIII. - GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 8.1. - Landscape provisions. 
A.  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of the City of South Daytona Landscape Regulations is to recapture and maintain many of the environmental features and amenities of the city for present and future generations. Adherence to this article will improve the appearance of off-street vehicular use areas (VUA) and commercial properties within the city through the installation and maintenance of landscaping for screening and aesthetic effects, thereby serving to protect and preserve the appearance, character, value and safety of the community and providing for the general welfare. In addition, the intent of this chapter is to provide for additional and adequate off-street drainage. It is intended that these provisions shall constitute minimum requirements; more stringent standards will be allowed. 
B.  Applicable areas. All vehicular use areas, except those located on, under, or within buildings, and except those serving one and two-family residential uses, shall conform to the minimum landscaping requirements hereinafter provided; commercial properties are also covered by these requirements. Vehicular use areas shall include all areas used for parking, circulation and/or display of any and all types of vehicles, boats or heavy construction equipment or other machinery capable of movements over streets and highways, whether self-propelled or not, and all areas upon which such vehicles traverse as a function of the primary uses of the related structures or properties. 
    These regulations shall apply to activities of a drive-in nature, such as a service station, convenience store, bank, restaurant, multiple dwellings, etc. The requirements set forth herein shall also apply to additions to existing VUA's and commercial properties. If the landscape area falls within the bounds of the applicable streetscape areas, streetscape provisions shall also apply. 
C.  Landscape permit requirements. Prior to the development or expansion of any vehicular use area or commercial property, application shall be made to the community development department for the approval of a site plan pursuant to Article III. Approval shall be issued by the community development department after review and determination by the development review committee that the plan meets the requirements of this Code. 
D.  Landscape standards. The development of VUA's and commercial properties shall conform to the following standards. 
1.  Landscaping shall consist of any of the following, or combination thereof: materials such as, but not limited to, grafts, ground covers, shrubs, bushes, hedges, flowering plants, vines, small trees, trees, or palms. In addition, non-living durable materials may be used to complement landscaping, but not to be credited as such. These materials include, but are not limited to, rocks, pebbles, wood chips, wood structures, walls, fences, and mulch, but not paving and sand. 
2.  Plant materials used in conformance with the provisions of this article shall conform to the standard for Florida No. 1, or better, as listed in the latest edition of Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants, State of Florida, Department of Agriculture, Tallahassee, Florida, or equivalent, except where, in the discretion of the city manager or his designee, natural vegetation is adequate to provide the necessary visual screening. 
a.  Trees shall be of a species recognized by the State of Florida, Division of Forestry, as being acceptable for this area. The number of different species of trees required shall be as follows: 
Required Number of Trees Minimum Number of Species 1-10 2 11-15 3 16-20 4 21-25 5 26-30 6 Over 30 7  
Trees shall be a species achieving, at maturity, an average crown spread of greater than 15 feet and having trunks which can be maintained with a minimum of six feet of clear wood trunk between finished grade and the lowest branch. Trees having an average mature crown of less than 15 feet may be substituted by grouping these trees to create the equivalent of a 15-foot crown spread. To encourage greenery, trees planted in excess of the minimum number required shall be exempt from the minimum crown spread. Shade tree species shall have a minimum diameter of 3.0 inches measured 6 inches above ground and shall be a minimum of 12 feet high at the time of planting. Where shade trees are planted in a row, they shall be planted at intervals no greater than 40 feet apart on-center. 
Understory trees shall have a minimum diameter of 2.5 inches measured six inches above ground and shall be a minimum of eight feet high at the time of planting. 
Where shade trees are specified but cannot be used due to site limitations, understory trees may be substituted at the ratio of two understory trees for every shade tree. 
Where understory trees are specified, but the applicant desires to use ornamentals trees, ornamental trees may be substituted at the ratio of two ornamental trees per understory tree. 
Where "multi-trunk" trees are specified, such as crepe myrtles or lagustrums, they must be a minimum of five trunks, each trunk having a minimum diameter of three-quarters inches. The minimum height of such a tree shall be eight feet. 
Where city staff determines that it is appropriate, at the request of the applicant, certain palms (such as cabbage palms or Washingtonian palms) may be substituted for specified shade trees at the ratio of three palms for each shade tree. However, no more than 25 percent of the total number of specified trees may be such palms. Except for high-value palms, palm trees will not be eligible for city grant assistance. 
Certain palms such as Canary Island, Pindo, and Majool may, due to their elegance and high value, be substituted for specified shade trees on a tree-for-tree basis. 
However, the use of Eucalyptus (camaldulensis), Australian pine (Casuarina equisetifolia), punk (melaleuca leucadendra) and Brazilian Pepper (schinus terebinthifolius) shall be prohibited under this section. 
b.  Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs, including hedges, shall be a minimum of two and one-half feet in height at the time of planting, and they must be a minimum three-gallon size. Shrubs must be planted at a distance not to exceed three feet on center. Hedges, where required, shall be planted and maintained so as to form a continuous unbroken, solid, visual screen within a maximum of one year after time of planting. Hedge plants are to be planted at distances no greater than 30 inches on center. 
c.  Ground cover. Ground cover of plant materials that reach an average height of not more than 18 inches may be used in lieu of grass, in whole or in part. These plants shall be a minimum one-gallon size, with a spacing that varies according to species but is never more than 36 inches on center. They shall be planted in such a manner so as to present a finished appearance with reasonably complete coverage. 
d.  Lawn grass. Grass areas shall be planted and may be sodded, plugged, sprigged, or seeded with native species. Solid sod shall be used in swales or other areas subject to erosion and providing that in areas where other than solid sod or grass seed is used, nurse grass seed shall be sown for immediate effect and protection until coverage is achieved. When sodding is used in any landscape application in the city, it shall be placed so as to provide a continuous and smooth contour. 
E.  Installation and maintenance. All landscaping shall be installed in a sound workmanship-like manner and according to accepted good planting procedures. All trees and palms must be properly staked at time of installation. The landscaping shall be installed so as to meet all applicable ordinances and code requirements. 
    The owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping which shall be maintained in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance and shall be kept free from weeds, refuse, and debris. Any installation which was made prior to the adoption of this Code, and in conformance with an approved site plan, shall be maintained in conformance with this Code. 
    All landscaped areas shall be provided with an automatic underground irrigation system, equipped with a rain sensor, adequate to service the landscaped areas. In the event that trees, shrubs, or other landscaped materials die, such materials shall be replaced within 30 days. In case of a natural disaster which destroys over 50 percent of the trees on the affected properties, the property owner shall have six months to replace the trees as required by this Article. Failure of the owner of the property to maintain the premises in good condition, as set forth above, shall make the owner liable for the penalties as set forth in Article IX. 
    No landscaped area may be abandoned, paved, or otherwise employed, without applying for and obtaining an amendment to an approved site plan pursuant to this article. 
F.  Landscaping adjacent to public right-of-way. Wherever a vehicular use area will not be entirely screened visually from any abutting right-of-way, except a dedicated alley, there shall be provided landscaping between such VUA and right-of-way as follows: 
1.  A strip of land at least seven feet in depth located adjacent to the abutting right-of-way, shall be landscaped, per the requirements of a Type 1 bufferyard. 
The remainder of the required landscaped areas shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover, or other acceptable materials, excluding paving, sand or gravel. 
Lands located along streets identified by the city for special treatment shall be planted with street trees in accordance with the provisions found in the South Daytona Streetscape Plan. 
2.  All property, other than the required landscape strip, lying between the street and VUA shall be landscaped with a combination of shrubs, ground cover, and trees equal to at least 50 percent of the landscape materials requirement. 
3.  Necessary accessways from the public right-of-way through all such landscaping shall be permitted to service the vehicular use area, and such accessways may be subtracted from the lineal dimension used to determine the number of trees required. 
G.  Perimeter landscaping relating to abutting properties. 
1.  Wherever a VUA will not be entirely screened visually from abutting property by an intervening building or structure, the portion of such VUA not so screened shall be provided with a landscape barrier meeting the requirements of a Type 1 bufferyard or a more restrictive bufferyard if required by the site use. The applicant is encouraged to incorporate earthen mounding, curvilinear design and offset placement of requirement plant life. Any perimeter landscaping strip in excess of ten feet shall incorporate these design standards. 
2.  Landscaping shall be provided in accordance with Type 1 bufferyard requirements. 
H.  Interior landscaping requirements. An area or combination of areas, equal to a minimum of ten percent of the total square footage of the VUA, shall be devoted to landscaping and may be counted as part of the interior landscaping requirement. When the VUA is adjacent to a structure or structures on the same parcel of land, any landscaping on said parcel which serves to beautify the VUA may be counted toward meeting the interior landscaping requirements. 
    Such landscaped areas shall be located in such a manner as to divide and break up the monotony of paving, or to prevent and discourage erratic vehicular movement. A combination of the following interior landscaping elements shall be counted as part of the interior landscaping requirements where applicable. 
1.  Landscape islands. Rows of parking spaces shall be separated every ten spaces and terminated on both ends by landscaped islands which measure an average of not less than ten feet in side width and extend the entire lengthy of the parking space(s). At least one tree, or grouping, shall be planted on said island. Landscape islands must be bounded by a concrete curb, minimum six high. 
2.  All parking rows shall be separated with a minimum landscape area of four feet above and beyond any landscaped vehicular overhang area. 
3.  In VUA's where the strict application of this section will seriously limit the function of said area, the required landscaping may be located near the perimeter of the paved area, including any perimeter which may be adjacent to a building on the site. This required interior landscaping shall be in addition to the required perimeter landscaping. 
4.  Parking spaces shall be designed through the use of wheel stops, curbing, or raised sidewalks to prevent the encroachment of vehicles upon or into landscaped areas and encourage runoff to the landscaped area only. (Encroachment is defined as any protrusion of a vehicle outside of a parking space, display area or accessway into a landscaped area). 
5.  All landscaping within a 15-foot radius of a fire hydrant shall consist of grass or ground cover which does not exceed 12 inches in height. When a fire hydrant is located in a terminal island, special treatment should be given to the placement of required plant material. 
I.  Unobstructed visibility at intersections. When an accessway intersects a public right-of-way, or when the subject property abuts the intersection of two or more public rights-of-way, all landscaping within the triangle areas described below shall provide unobstructed cross visibility at a level between three feet and seven feet, with the following proviso: that trees or palms shall have limbs and foliage trimmed in such a manner that no limbs or foliage extend into the cross-visibility area. The triangle areas referred to above, are: 
1.  The triangle areas within the property on both sides of the accessway formed by the intersection of each side of the accessway and the public right-of-way line with two sides of each triangle being ten feet in length from the point of intersection and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the other two sides. 
2.  The area of property located at the corner formed by the intersection of two or more public rights-of-way with two sides of the triangular area being 30 feet in length along the abutting public right-of-way lines, or projections thereof, measured from their point of intersection, and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the other two lines, and including all surfaced portions of the public right-of-way adjacent thereto. 
J.  Existing plant material. If the owner(s) can demonstrate that healthy plant material exists on a site prior to its development for the purposes of off-street parking or other vehicular use areas, the application of the above landscape standards may be adjusted to allow credit for such plant material if such an adjustment is in keeping with the intent of this section. 
K.  Stormwater management. All VUA's shall provide for adequate management of stormwater in accordance with the requirements of this Code, and they must be shown on all development plans. Areas required for landscaping may be used for stormwater management as long as the landscaping purposes of this section are not impeded. 
L.  Xeriscape. The use of xeriscape principles shall be allowed, particularly as a means of water conservation. 
M.  South Daytona Streetscape Guidelines. In order to improve the City's appearance, environment, and community welfare, the City hereby adopts by reference the document entitled "Streetscape Guidelines" (April, 1989). Those guidelines set forth concepts for planting of street trees along major roadway segments and other areas of the city. All proposed development falling within those described areas, shall be reviewed in light of those guidelines, as a supplement to the other landscape requirements found herein. 
N.  City inspection prior to installation of landscaping. Proposed landscaping project sites shall be inspected by the city prior to installation of the landscaping. The landscape installer shall submit a timely request for such an inspection to the community development department prior to installation. 
O.  City acceptance of landscaping projects. The community development director or his designee shall be responsible for acceptance of landscaping projects after they are completed. Prior to acceptance, the following actions are required: 
1.  A qualified city employee or contracted party shall inspect the landscaping to ensure that it meets city standards. 
2.  An as-built drawing of the landscaping shall be submitted to the community development department containing notes to the effect that the plants meet the "Florida #1" standard and that the installation meets the "sound workmanship" requirement.

No person shall park any car, truck, trailer, boat or other vehicle on a public right-of-way, public property, or private property so as to be clearly visible from a public right- of-way, which has attached thereto or located thereon any sign or advertising device for the primary purpose of providing advertisement of products or directing people to a business or business activity. This provision is not intended to prohibit any form of public vehicular signage such as a sign attached to a public bus. Neither shall this provision be a sign lettered on or attached to a motor vehicle in a manner to primarily identify the vehicle with the business it serves so long as the sign is less than six square feet in area, and the vehicle is regularly used for transportation in the conduct of the business. 
8.  Non-conforming signs. Any sign which is rendered non-conforming by the enactment of these sign regulations shall be allowed to continue in a non-conforming status under the following conditions. 
a.  Non-conforming signs shall be maintained and repaired until their elimination date, but they shall not be structurally or mechanically extended or altered to further the non-conformity. Replacement or repainting of the sign face shall be permitted. 
b.  Tolerance provision: Existing non-conforming signs with reference to their existing dimensions, shall be allowed to exceed the height and size standards of this Code by a degree not exceeding 25 percent for the life of the sign.

d.  Type A signs (the "in excess of three freestanding signs per property" category) shall be allowed to retain their non-conforming status until December 31, 1997 the elimination date, at which time all such non-conforming signs shall be eliminated. For example, if a shopping center presently has seven non-conforming freestanding signs, the owner must eliminate four of them within the approximately five-year period; however, the remaining three signs would be classified as Type B signs, with a remaining life of approximately ten years. 
e.  Type B signs shall be allowed to retain their non- conforming status until December 31, 2002 the elimination date, at which time all such non-conforming signs shall be eliminated, except for those for which the sole non-conformity is that they do not meet the five-foot setback requirement (see provision 8-f below).

Any Type B sign whose sole non-conformity is a violation of the five-foot setback requirement shall be allowed to retain its non-conforming status until such time as a substantial change in the building occurs. The term "substantial change" shall include, but not be limited to, such phenomena as replacing the existing building with a new one, substantial exterior remodeling or modernization of the existing building, or putting an addition on the existing building. The term "substantial change" shall not include such activities as repair and maintenance, including painting. A five-foot setback only non- conforming sign could last beyond the usual elimination date for a Type B sign if there is no substantial change in the related building by that date. However, Type A signs are not eligible for five-foot setback only consideration.

Such an agreement may contain provisions that conflict with certain other provisions of the sign code by allowing, for example, placement of advertising signage in the public right-of-way, installation of free-standing signs to a height greater than 15 feet, and provision of off-premises advertising. Where the provisions of the franchise agreement conflict with those found elsewhere in the sign code, the provisions of the franchise agreement shall prevail.

The chief building official is empowered to use the following penalties to seek the remedy of violations: stop work order; withhold a certificate of occupancy; and double permit fees. 
    In addition to the criminal penalties provided herein, any person who violates any provision for tree protection shall forfeit and pay to The City of South Daytona a civil penalty equal to the total value of those trees illegally removed or damaged, as computed from the International Society of Arboriculture shade-tree-value formula.
