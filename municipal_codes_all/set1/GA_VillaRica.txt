PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Villa Rica, Georgia. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1993 Code, as updated by ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and council through September 1, 2015. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1993 Code, as updated, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jim C. Jenkins, Senior Code Attorney, and Beth Tattershall, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Alisa Doyal, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Subpart B - CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS OF LOCAL APPLICATION 
ARTICLE I. - HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION[1] 
    Section 1. Article VII, section I, Paragraph IV of the Constitution is hereby amended by adding at the end thereof the following: 
    "Any other provisions of this Constitution to the contrary notwithstanding, the governing authority of the City of Villa Rica is hereby authorized to grant an exemption from all city ad valorem taxes in an amount to be fixed by the governing authority at not more than $2,000.00 on a homestead owned and occupied by a resident of the city as a residence and homestead, and only so long as actually occupied by the owner primarily as such. The value of the residence in excess of the amount so exempted shall remain subject to taxation. Any such resident shall not receive the benefits of such homestead exemption unless he or his agent provides the governing authority of the city, or a person designated by the governing authority, with an affidavit stating that he is a resident and that such property is his homestead and residence and containing such additional information as will enable the governing authority to make a determination as to whether such person is entitled to such exemption. The governing authority shall provide the necessary forms for such purpose. After any such person has filed the proper affidavit and has been allowed the exemption provided herein, it shall not be necessary that he make application and file said affidavit thereafter for any subsequent year, and the said exemption shall continue to be allowed to such person. It shall be the duty of such person to notify the governing authority in the event he becomes ineligible for any reason for the exemption provided in this paragraph. The homestead exemption provided for herein shall not be granted nor the amount fixed within the limits prescribed herein for any year until the governing authority of the city provides by ordinance for the granting of such exemption and the amount thereof. The governing authority of the city may provide by ordinance for the proper administration of this exemption."

(7)  Reject any and all bids when, in the opinion of the city manager, it is in the best interest of the city to do so.

(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.040), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-108. - Pre-audit certification. 
    The purchasing agent shall not execute any contract for goods or services until the budget officer certifies, after pre-audit, that there is to the credit of the using department a sufficient unencumbered appropriation balance in excess of all unpaid obligations, to defray the amount of such contract. Subject to the approval of the budget officer, the purchasing agent may issue operating rules to ensure compliance with this section. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.050), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-109. - Ethics. 
    It is the policy of the city to seek the best overall value when procuring goods and services. Toward this end, the city finds and declares that its objectives will best be achieved through an open, competitive process with a broad range of responsible vendors wishing to furnish products and services to the city. The city will set up and conduct a procurement program that maximizes service benefit to the community and awards contracts to vendors who offer the best value. 
(1)  The city declares that city employees and officials along with those wishing to do business with the city have the shared responsibility for avoiding biased, anticompetitive or unethical practices when such receipt has the potential to influence a procurement decision or to gain undue advantage in a procurement competition. 
(2)  The purchasing agent and every officer and employee of the city whose duties involve the purchase or sale of goods and/or services, or the preparation of specifications for the purchase of goods and/or services for the city, or deciding which goods shall be declared surplus are expressly prohibited from seeking, requesting, or receiving any material payment, gift, job offer, security, promise of future benefit, or any other tangible or intangible thing of value, directly or indirectly, from any person, company, firm or corporation which seeks to do business with or contract with the city or has contracted with the city within the preceding 12 months, or to which any purchase order or contract is awarded, or to whom any surplus goods may be sold. 
(3)  Prospective vendors must compete for city business within the parameters of the solicitation process and are prohibited from seeking to obtain inside information, attempting to skew the writing of specifications or influencing a procurement decision through any means outside the process established for the particular solicitation. This principle applies to any contractor, subcontractor, representative, employee or agent that may be associated with a procurement transaction. 
(4)  The city's ethics regulations, as set forth in article VI of this chapter, and the city Charter should be consulted for requirements related to lobbying and representation of business interests that come before the city council or city officials for decision. 
(5)  Ethical business practices are important both during a solicitation and after the decision to grant an award. To this end, the city seeks to establish relationships with business partners whose ongoing ethical standards of business conduct are congruent with those outlined here. The purchasing agent is charged with establishing methods for ongoing monitoring for non-compliance with these principles. The prohibition against the offering of or the acceptance of gifts, favors, kickbacks, gratuities, payments or any other thing of value extends beyond and outside any specific procurement or solicitation. 
(6)  A vendor's contract compliance history with the city and other contractual parties is a valid element in the decision to award a solicitation. 
(7)  The city stipulates that the furtherance of its strategic goals for job creation, stability and growth in the tax base, business retention, and other fiscal and economic development objectives may be considered during the procurement process. The city manager is authorized to establish procurement initiatives consistent with the city's strategic economic development objectives. These procurement practices shall be applied consistently and equitably, and shall have a direct relationship to the city's goals. 
(8)  City employees, officials, and their family members are generally prohibited from participation in any procurement decision or any gain of undue advantage in a procurement competition as a result of contemporaneous employment with a potential or actual business partner. 
(9)  It is unethical for any city employee to purchase commodities or services from a city contract for personal use. 
(10)  Individuals, firms and businesses seeking an award of a city contract may not initiate or continue any verbal or written communications regarding a solicitation with any city officer, elected official, employee or other city representative other than the purchasing agent named in the solicitation between the date of the issuance of the solicitation and the date of the final contract award by the city council. The city manager and budget officer will review violations. If it is determined that such communication has compromised the competitive process, the offer submitted by the individual, firm or business may be disqualified from consideration for award. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.060), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-110. - Disclaimer of responsibility for improper purchasing. 
    The city council may disclaim responsibility and liability for any purchase, expenditure, or agreement for expenditure arising from procurement made in its name, or in the name of any governmental body under its authority, by an unauthorized person or any person acting outside this article or the authorization or delegation as provided in this article. The expense of any such disclaimed transaction will become the personal liability of the individual who acted improperly. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.061), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-111. - Evasion prohibited. 
    No purchase or sale shall be artificially divided for the purpose of evading the provisions of this article. Neither shall this process be used for frequently recurring acquisitions that warrant volume purchases or periodic term contracts. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.070), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-112. - Summary of methods of procurement. 
    In most cases, this article recognizes seven methods of procurement and the conditions where each method shall be used: 
(1)  Informal purchase. Those purchases $10,000.00 or less do not justify the administrative time and expense for the conduct of competitive sealed bids or proposals. 
(2)  Competitive sealed bidding. In most cases the competitive sealed bid is the preferred method of procurement in the public sector and should be used whenever possible as it allows qualified, responsive bidders to compete on the basis of price. Generally, the following conditions must be met: 
a.  Clear and adequate specifications are available. 
b.  Three or more responsible bidders are willing to participate in the process. 
c.  Cost of materials, supplies, equipment, services or project is greater than $10,000.00. 
d.  Revenue is greater than $10,000.00. 
(3)  Competitive sealed proposal. When use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal. Use of the proposal is dependent upon such factors as: 
a.  Whether quality, availability or capability is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or technical or professional services. 
b.  Whether the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the city's best interest. 
c.  Whether a fixed price or cost type contract is more advantageous. 
d.  Whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternate proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award. 
e.  Cost of equipment, services or project is greater than $10,000.00. 
f.  Revenue is greater than $10,000.00. 
(4)  Sole source purchase. A sole source procurement may be used when only one vendor or supplier is able to fill requirements for the intended use. Sole source may be used for compatibility with equipment for repair purposes, or for compatibility with existing systems. Standardization may require a sole source procurement, depending upon the intended use. Standardization, which is either established as a result of past procurements or by approval of the city manager, can be a satisfactory justification for a sole source. The city council shall approve all purchases where cost is greater than $10,000.00. 
(5)  Emergency purchase. The purchasing agent shall have the authority to purchase commodities and services where there exists an emergency constituting a threat to public health, safety or welfare or to the soundness and integrity of public property or to the delivery of essential services and where the adverse effects of such emergency may worsen materially with the passage of time. Acquisitions shall be made using such competitive procedures as circumstances reasonably permit. Emergencies shall be documented by the using department and submitted to the purchasing office. When a situation exists where time does not permit the involvement of the purchasing office, the user department director is authorized to purchase necessary commodities or make necessary repairs. For emergencies where cost exceeds the amount authorized to a using department, written documentation shall be prepared by the user department director and submitted to the purchasing office explaining the nature of the emergency. All emergencies where the cost is greater than $10,000.00 require ratification of the city council. 
(6)  Cooperative purchase. The city may participate in a cooperative purchase for commodities, supplies and services when determined that it is in the best interest of the city. The sponsoring entity, whether federal, state or local must have performed a competitive procurement process and entered into a contract that stipulates allowance for other governmental entities to purchase from the supplier at the same price and under the same terms and conditions as extended to it. If such arrangement has not been made a part of the contract, written permission from the sponsoring entity and the awarded supplier must be obtained. Documentation to substantiate this decision will be maintained by the purchasing office. Cooperative purchases where the cost is greater than $10,000.00 shall be approved by the city council. 
(7)  Governmental and affiliated entity purchase. The city may purchase services and incidental commodities from other federal, state or local governments, associations and nonprofit organizations when determined to be in the best interest of the city. Documentation to substantiate this decision will be maintained by the purchasing office. Such purchases where cost is greater than $10,000.00 shall be approved by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.080), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-113. - Mandatory pre-qualification process. 
(a)  Public works construction contracts governed by O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20 et seq. The purchasing agent is hereby delegated the authority to administer a process for mandatory pre-qualification of prospective bidders for public works construction contracts pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20(f). 
(b)  All other contracts. The purchasing agent is authorized to determine that a process for mandatory pre-qualification for competitive sealed bids and competitive sealed proposals of bidders or proposers is appropriate for the procurement of a particular commodity or service, subject to these requirements: 
(1)  Criteria for pre-qualification shall be reasonably related to the project or the quality of the work. 
(2)  Criteria for pre-qualification shall be available to any prospective bidder requesting such information. 
(3)  There shall be a method of notifying prospective bidders of the criteria for pre-qualification. 
(4)  There shall be a procedure for a disqualified bidder to respond to his disqualification to the purchasing agent; however, such procedure shall not include a formal appeal. 
(5)  No bid or proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the city from a prospective bidder who has not been pre-qualified on the procurement in question where the invitation to bid or request for proposals specified that pre-qualification would be mandatory, and any bid or proposal received shall be returned to the prospective bidder unopened. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.082), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-114. - Purchases based on informal procurement. 
(a)  Generally. Procurements that involve amounts $10,000.00 or less do not require a formal sealed bid/proposal process. However, the processes used for this type of procurement will include as much competition as is consistent with the anticipated cost of the procurement and the best interest of the city. 
(b)  Prohibition of improper use of informal purchase process. Purchases may not be artificially divided as to constitute an informal purchase, thereby circumventing the dollar limit requirement for competitive sealed bids/proposals. 
(c)  Procedures. Procurement within this category shall be made in accordance with the informal purchase procedures established by the purchasing agent. These procedures will cover purchases delegated to user departments as well as those handled through the central procurement process. Such operational procedures shall provide for obtaining adequate and reasonable competition for the supply, service or construction being purchased. Further, such operational procedures shall require the preparation and maintenance of written records to adequately document the competition obtained, properly account for the funds expended and facilitate audit/review of the transaction. 
(d)  Types of informal purchases. Informal purchases are classified by two categories: 
(1)  Those that may be made directly by the using department. 
(2)  Those that are required to be made through the central procurement process. 
(e)  Informal purchase by user departments. 
(1)  Authority. Each user department is granted the authority, at the discretion of the department director or city manager, to handle purchases where the cost is less than $2,500.00. 
(2)  Prohibition of misuse. Purchases may not be artificially divided in order to qualify for handling by the using departments. Neither shall this process be used for frequently recurring acquisitions that warrant volume purchases or periodic term contracts. 
(f)  Informal purchases by purchasing staff. 
(1)  Purchasing staff shall obtain commodities and services competitively through telephone solicitations where the cost is $2,500.00 or less. A minimum of three quotations is required unless adequate source supply is not available. 
(2)  Purchasing staff shall obtain commodities and services competitively through written quotations where the cost is $2,500.00 to $10,000.00. A minimum of three written quotations is required unless adequate source supply is not available. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.090), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-115. - Competitive sealed bids. 
(a)  Acquisitions greater than $10,000.00. Any commodity that is expected to cost or generate revenue greater than $10,000.00 shall be acquired through the competitive sealed bid process except as otherwise provided in this article. 
(b)  Dissemination of invitation to bid. Public notice of an invitation to bid shall be given as required by state law. The public notice shall contain a general description of the purchase, shall state the location where documents may be obtained and the date, time and place of bid opening. Notice of any required bonding and insurance shall be included in the public notice. A copy of such notice shall be posted in the purchasing office. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in additional competition may be used in addition to required advertisement, at the discretion of the purchasing agent. 
(c)  Receipt of bid. No written bid shall be eligible for consideration by the city unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the purchasing office by the date and time specified in the invitation to bid. All bids shall be stamped or annotated with the date and time of receipt and secured until the designated opening time. A bid delivered late shall under no circumstances be eligible for consideration by the city. 
(d)  Bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the invitation to bid. The name of each bidder, the purchase price contained in each bid, and such other information as the purchasing agent deems appropriate shall be announced as the bids are opened. A record of bid information shall be recorded and available for public inspection. 
(e)  Modification of bid. Any clerical mistake that is patently obvious on the face of a bid, subject to the limitations described in this subsection, may be corrected upon written request and verification, submitted by the bidder. A non-material omission in a bid may be corrected if the purchasing agent determines the correction to be in the city's best interest. Omissions affecting or relating to any of the following shall be deemed material and shall not be corrected after bid opening: 
(1)  Price information. 
(2)  Any required bonding. 
(f)  Withdrawal of bid. Bids may be withdrawn at any time prior to the bid opening. After bids have been publicly opened, withdrawal of bid shall be based upon the following: 
(1)  The bidder shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to withdraw his bid due to an error within two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure. 
(2)  Bids may be withdrawn from consideration if the price was substantially lower than the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of the bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. The bidder's original work papers shall be the sole acceptable evidence of error and mistake if a request is made to withdraw the bid. If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision, the lowest remaining responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low bid. 
(g)  Bid evaluation. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation to bid. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not specifically set forth in the solicitation. 
(h)  Bid cancellation. An invitation to bid may be canceled prior to opening date or any or all bids may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the best interest of the city in accordance with regulations promulgated by the purchasing office or, as a result of improper conduct on the part of a city employee. The reasons for any cancellation shall be made part of the bid file. 
(i)  Bid award. 
(1)  Responsive and responsible bidders. Subject to approval by the city council, bids shall be awarded to the responsible bidders who have submitted the lowest cost responsive bids, highest revenue responsive bids, or whose bid represents the best value to the city. 
(2)  Approval of bid. All bid awards for amounts greater than $10,000.00 (cost or revenue) shall be approved by the city council. 
(3)  Rejection or deferral of bid. The purchasing agent may reject bids, or may defer bid awards to allow time for additional evaluation or review of bids or for other business purposes, consistent with the best interest of the city. 
(4)  Disqualification of bid. The following types of bids shall be disqualified for consideration for a bid award: 
a.  A proposal submitted without required bonds. 
b.  A proposal submitted by an individual, firm or business on the ineligible source list. 
c.  A proposal which is incomplete in any material fact. 
d.  A proposal submitted by an individual, firm or business that has litigation pending against the city, or anyone representing a firm or business in litigation against the city, not arising out of the procurement process. 
(5)  Tie bids. In the event two responsive bids are tied for the lowest price and the other terms and conditions of the two bids are substantially the same, the bid shall be awarded to the local vendor if only one of the bidders has an office located within the boundaries of the city. If both or neither of the tied bidders are local vendors, the purchasing staff shall request the firm's best and final offers, and the award shall be to the lowest bid. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.100), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-116. - Competitive sealed proposals. 
(a)  Acquisitions greater than $10,000.00. Any item or service which is expected to cost or generate revenue greater than $10,000.00, when the competitive sealed bid process is not applicable nor in the best interest of the city, shall be acquired through the competitive sealed proposal process except as otherwise provided in this article. 
(b)  Dissemination of proposal. Proposals shall be disseminated through a request for proposal. Public notice shall be advertised as required by state law. The public notice shall contain a general description of the item or service to be purchased, shall state the location where documents may be obtained and the date, time and place of proposal receipt. Notice of any required bonding and insurance shall be included in the public notice. A copy of such notice shall be posted in the purchasing office. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in additional competition may be used in addition to required advertisement, at the discretion of the purchasing agent. 
(c)  Receipt of proposal. No written proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the city unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the purchasing office by the date and time specified in the request for proposals. All proposals shall be stamped or annotated with the date and time of receipt and secured until the designated opening time.

The reasons for any cancellation shall be made part of the proposal file. 
(f)  Proprietary information. Information submitted by a proposer that is specifically marked "proprietary" shall not be disclosed outside of the purchasing office without prior notification to the proposer. The city is required to comply with the Georgia Open Records Act (O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq.) and therefore may not be able to protect information submitted in any response. Entire proposals may not be deemed "proprietary." 
(g)  Evaluation of proposal. 
(1)  Initial evaluation. Each proposal shall be evaluated to determine whether it is responsive to the specifications and other terms and conditions contained in the request for proposals. With the approval of the purchasing associate named in the solicitation, the evaluating team may communicate with each proposer to clarify and amplify each proposer's proposal. No information concerning any other proposer's proposal shall be communicated in any way to the proposer.

(h)  Award of proposal. 
(1)  Responsive and responsible proposal. Award shall be made to the responsive and responsible proposer whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the city based upon the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal. In the event there are two or more firms whose scores rounded to the nearest whole number result in a tie score, the award will be based on lowest cost. 
(2)  Approval of proposal. The city council shall approve all awards where cost or revenue is greater than $10,000.00. 
(3)  Rejection or deferral of proposal. The purchasing agent may reject, or may defer award for any proposal when he or she deems such action to be in the best interest of the city.

Sec. 2-117. - Construction acquisition. 
    Construction acquisition shall follow the procedures for formal procurement in accordance with section 2-115, with competitive sealed bids in section 2-116 being the preferred method of procurement.

(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.130), 8-4-2015)

(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.140), 8-4-2015)

Release of bonds to the successful bidder shall be conditioned upon the bidder's execution of a contract within 30 days following the city's award.

The purchasing agent with the assistance of the city manager shall be authorized to conduct random audits of a contractor's or subcontractors' compliance with O.C.G.A. § 13-10-91 and the rules and regulations of the state department of labor. The contractor and subcontractors shall retain all documents and records of its compliance for a period of three years following completion of the contract. This requirement shall apply to all contracts for the physical performance of services where any persons are employed on the city contract.

If it is determined that a subcontractor is not participating in the federal work authorization program as defined by O.C.G.A. § 13-10-90 et seq., the city shall direct the contractor to terminate that subcontractor. A contractor's failure to follow the city's instruction to terminate a subcontractor that is not participating in the federal work authorization program as defined by O.C.G.A. § 13-10-90 et seq., shall be sanctioned by termination of the contract and any other active contract between the contractor and the city. 
(4)  Any contractor found to be in non-compliance as defined by O.C.G.A. § 13-10-90 et seq., shall be placed on the city's ineligible vendor list for a period of 12 months following the termination date of the contract.

ARTICLE IX. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 8-257. - Adult entertainment establishments; findings; public purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. 
(b)  Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities including, but not limited to, Troup County, Georgia; Saint Paul, Minnesota; Houston, Austin, and Amarillo, Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona; which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city, and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before us, the mayor and council take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among communities within our country. 
(c)  Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment", leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions, blight and diminution in property values. In the same manner, establishments offering photographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
(d)  Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are: disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use, and corruption of public officials. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are: depression of property values, acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. 
(e)  Furthermore, it is the finding of the mayor and council that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in neighborhoods, commercial districts and urban life in general. 
(f)  Accordingly, it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety, and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impact of adult entertainment establishments by limiting the number of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment establishments or adult uses upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semi-public uses, to ensure that adult uses and adult entertainment establishments do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts, and so as to avoid allowing adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily used public pedestrian areas. 
(g)  Therefore, the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment establishments to certain prescribed areas of the city is in the public welfare, and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses. 
(h)  While it is recognized that such regulation as is established by this article cannot de facto approach prohibition as a protected form of expression would vanish, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. 
(i)  To that end, the ordinance from which this article is derived is hereby adopted.

Sec. 12-24. - Findings and intent. 
    The ordinance from which this article is derived is adopted to address the interest of public safety. Personal transportation vehicles (PTVs) and other similar vehicles are not designed or manufactured to be used on public highways, streets and roads, (hereafter "public roads") and the city in no way advocates their operation on the public roads within its jurisdiction. Adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived is not to be relied upon as a determination by the city that operation of PTV on public roads is safe or advisable if done in accordance with this article. By regulating such operation the city is merely addressing safety issues. All persons who operate or ride in PTV on public roads do so with their own judgment and at their own risk, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the city has no liability in negligence, nuisance or under any other cause of action for losses resulting from the use of PTV on roads, sidewalks, rights-of-way or other public property under this article. Any person who operates PTV and other similar vehicles is responsible for procuring appropriate insurance as may be required by any state law or this article as a condition of operating PTV and other similar vehicles on the roads of the city. 
(Ord. No. 02-15-CCO, § 1(11-51), 7-7-2015; Ord. No. 09-15-CCO, § 1(11-51), 9-1-2015)

(a)  It is the duty of the owner of every dwelling, building, structure, or property within the jurisdiction to construct and maintain such dwelling, building, structure, or property in conformance with applicable codes in force within the city, or such ordinances which regulate and prohibit activities on property and which declare it to be a public nuisance to construct or maintain any dwelling, building, structure or property in violation of such codes or ordinances.

If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the owner and parties in interest in such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the owner and the parties in interest; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the owner and parties in interest that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction as determined by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, at a date and time certain and at a place within the city where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in court. The owner and parties in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
(d)  If after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
(1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
(2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
For purposes of this chapter, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be factors in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the city. 
(e)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure, to be repaired, altered, improved, to be vacated and closed, or demolished. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
    "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
(f)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
(g)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
(h)  With respect to the lien provided for in subsection (g) of this section: 
(1)  The lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in Carroll or Douglas County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(g). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of Carroll or Douglas County and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collection of real property ad valorem tax, including specifically O.C.G.A. title 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes; 
(2)  The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7 et seq., unless such costs are waived by resolution of Carroll or Douglas County. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the city to pay the cost of administering the lien; and 
(3)  The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
(i)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
(j)  The public officers designated herein may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation in court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this chapter. 
(k)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to abrogate or impair the powers of the courts or of any department of the city to enforce any provisions of any local enabling Act, Charter, or ordinance or regulation nor to prevent or punish violations thereof; and the powers conferred by this chapter shall be in addition to and supplemental to the powers conferred by any other law or ordinance, legislation, or regulation.

(a)  The public officer may determine, under existing ordinances, that a dwelling, building, or structure is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use if he finds that conditions exist in such building, dwelling, or structure which are dangerous or injurious to the health or safety of the occupants of such dwelling, building, or structure; of the occupants of neighborhood dwelling, buildings, or structures; or of other residents of the city.

Sec. 16-7. - Nuisances defined. 
    A nuisance is anything which tends to lead to the immediate annoyance of the citizens in general, or which is manifestly injurious to the public health and safety, or tends greatly to corrupt the morals and manners of the people, with exception given to those rights protected in the Constitution. Nuisances include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Stagnant water on premises; 
(2)  Dead or decaying matter left unattended; 
(3)  Weeds or grass in excess of four inches on lots with a residence. For vacant lots in platted subdivisions, the limit for grass and weeds is eight inches on the property. This requirement does not apply to properties used for agricultural purposes. The public officer shall have the discretion to waive this requirement to allow vacant lots to return to their natural state when: 
a.  The configuration of the lots and the history of development within the subdivision are such that no substantial harm is caused to other lots in the subdivision and that development of the vacant lots is not imminent; or 
b.  Additional green space will be created within a subdivision. The purpose of this waiver is to recognize that in some limited circumstances, it may be more appropriate to allow undeveloped lots to return to their natural state than to require unwanted and unnecessary maintenance. 
(4)  Excess smoke or fumes caused by burning; 
(5)  Maintaining a dangerous or diseased animal;

(c)  In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the city manager, chief of police, or the chief's designated representative shall balance the hardship to the applicant, the community, and other persons of not granting the special variance against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected, and any other adverse impact of granting the special variance. Applicants for special variances may be required to submit any information the city manager, chief of police, or the chiefs representative may reasonably require. In granting or denying an application, the city manager, chief of police, or the chiefs representative shall place on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying or granting the special variance. 
(d)  Special variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted activity. The special variance shall not become effective until all conditions are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any condition of the special variance shall terminate it and subject the person holding it to those provisions of this article regulating the source of sound or activity for which the special variance was granted. 
(e)  Application for extension of time limits specified in special variances or for modification of other substantial conditions shall be treated like applications for initial special variances. 
(f)  The city manager, chief of police, or the chiefs designated representative may issue guidelines approved by city council defining the procedures to be followed in applying for a special variance and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether or not to grant a special variance.

Footnotes:

Editor's note- Ord. No. 12-08-CCO, § 1, adopted Sept. 4, 2012, set out provisions adding Ch. 13, Art. IV, §§ 13-57-13-66. For purposes of classification, and at the editor's discretion, said provisions have been included herein as superseding former Ch. 16, Art. IV, §§ 16-106-16-110, which pertained to foreclosure registry and derived from Ord. No. 11-01-CCO, 2011. See also the Code Comparative Table. 

Sec. 16-111. - Short title. 
    This article shall be known as the "Villa Rica Vacant and Foreclosed Property Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 12-08-CCO, § 1, 9-4-2012) 
Sec. 16-112. - Findings and intent. 
    This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety. 
(a)  The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure and vacant real property as a mechanism to protect property values in neighborhoods for all property owners. 
(b)  Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted. 
(c)  Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this article. 
(d)  This foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners and agents to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of Municipal Code of Villa Rica, Georgia.

ARTICLE II. - PROHIBITION ON THE USE, SALE, OR DELIVERY OF CERTAIN DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES AND ASSOCIATED PARAPHERNALIA 

Sec. 18-30. - Purpose. 
(a)  The mayor and city council has been informed about the presence of potentially dangerous substances affecting the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens, particularly the youth, of the city. In response to these warnings, the mayor and city council have been provided information indicating that this threat is presented in the form of products sold or distributed as a mixture of dried vegetation that, when covered, sprayed, or mixed with certain specific chemicals, produces the physiological and psychological effects of a controlled substance such as marijuana. 
(b)  Such substances are reported to cause hallucinations, vomiting, agitation, panic attacks, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, pallor, numbness and tingling, disorientation, loss of time awareness, and in some cases, tremors and seizures. 
(c)  These substances are generally described as synthetic cannabinoids of salvia divinorum distributed, sold, and marketed under such names as "K-3," "K-2," "K-2 Summit," "Genie," "Dascents," "Zohai," "Sage," "Spice," "Ko Knockout 2," "Spice Gold," "Spice Diamond," "Yucatan Fire," "Solar Flare," "Pep Spice," "Fire 'n' Ice," "Black Magic Smoke," "Salvia Divinorum," "Extreme Potpourri," and "Phat Cat." 
(d)  The substances described in subsection (c) of this section may be marked as incense, but are commonly being used as an alternative to marijuana, which is an identified and documented controlled substance, the sale and use of which is prohibited under the laws of the state and of the United States. These synthetic cannabinoid substances may be presented under a variety of street names, but share common ingredients including JWH018 and JWH073. Salvia divinorum contains the ingredient known as salvinorum A. These unregulated synthetic cannabinoids and salvia divinorum produce a very potent, intoxicating effect which is estimated by the medical community to produce effects ranging from three to 100 times greater and more potent than THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. 
(e)  The substances identified in this section manifest all of the demonstrated attributes that deprive persons of judgment, coordination, and the ability to conduct themselves in a safe and appropriate manner in modern society. The available medical and law enforcement information on these products indicate that a person under the effects of these substances may be a clear and present danger to themselves and others.

ARTICLE V. - TRAFFIC CALMING PROGRAM 

Sec. 22-121. - Purpose. 
    In response to numerous complaints about speeding problems in neighborhoods, the City of Villa Rica Community Development Department has studied other similar communities along with other research on this topic. This research found that the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) completed a report for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) titled, Traffic Calming: State of the Practice. This report contains several types of traffic calming devices and defines traffic calming as follows: "Traffic calming is the combination of mainly physical measures that reduce the negative effects of motor vehicle use, alter driver behavior and improve conditions for non-motorized street users". The information in this report is critical to this policy and shall be used as a guide for any traffic calming device placed within Villa Rica. The above mentioned report is available for review at the community development office or you may order a copy from the ITE bookstore online at www.ite.org. The following policy has been established for the citizens of Villa Rica who wish to pursue the installation of traffic calming devices in their neighborhoods. 
    The objective of the City of Villa Rica Traffic Calming Program is to provide property owners a process to have installed traffic calming devices on city-maintained neighborhood roads, where engineering studies indicate that their use would meet the desired results of reducing neighborhood speeds and their installation is favored by 75 percent of the homeowners in the subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 13-16-CCO, § 1, 7-5-2016) 
Sec. 22-122. - Installation considerations. 
    The community development department will only consider installation of traffic calming devices on streets classified as local, residential streets with a posted speed limit of 25 mph or less. Data obtained from traffic engineering studies of physical and traffic-related factors should be used in determining where traffic calming devices are appropriate. Traffic engineering studies may indicate that traffic calming devices would be unnecessary or unsafe at certain locations. 
(Ord. No. 13-16-CCO, § 2, 7-5-2016) 
Sec. 22-123. - Legal authority. 
    Only the Villa Rica City Council can authorize the placement of a traffic calming device and shall also have the authority to remove any traffic calming device as may be deemed appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 13-16-CCO, § 3, 7-5-2016) 
Sec. 22-124. - Standardization of application. 
    In keeping with the general recommendation of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), uniformity aids in the recognition and understanding of traffic control devices. Therefore, strict adherence to the standards and guidelines outlined in this manual will help ensure that any given traffic calming device installation will be equally recognizable and require the same action on the part of the motorists regardless of where it is encountered. 
(Ord. No. 13-16-CCO, § 4, 7-5-2016) 
Sec. 22-125. - Traffic calming device design. 
    The city will be responsible for having the new traffic calming device engineered by a registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia and submitted to community development for approval. The ITE report titled Traffic Calming: State of the Practice shall be utilized when considering an appropriate traffic calming device. The design for roadways and other structures shall be in accordance with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' A Policy on Geometric Design of Highway and Streets (commonly referred to as the AASHTO Green Book). 
(Ord. No. 13-16-CCO, § 5, 7-5-2016) 
Sec. 22-126. - Expense. 
    The city will be responsible for the cost of engineering and construction of the traffic calming device. 
(Ord. No. 13-16-CCO, § 6, 7-5-2016) 
Sec. 22-127. - Procedure. 
(a)  Petition for traffic calming device. To have a traffic calming device installed in City of Villa Rica, a petition must be submitted to community development. All of the property owners in the subdivision or defined service area shall be contacted and given opportunity to sign this petition, indicating "yes" or "no" concerning the installation of traffic calming devices. If both husband and wife are joint legal owners, both signatures are required. A "Mr. and Mrs." signature is not acceptable. Owners must sign individually. This includes owners of undeveloped lots; renting tenants are not an acceptable substitute for the legal homeowner. No signature will be withdrawn from the petition after it is filed with community development. The purpose of the witness' signature is to verify the signatures of the property owners. The percentages will be calculated, based on individual lots where owners' sign affirmatively, divided by the total number of lots in the platted subdivision. Each lot counts as only one vote, regardless of the number of owners signing. If lots require more than one signature and do not have a unanimous vote, the vote will not be counted. At least 75 percent of the lots must vote in favor of the traffic calming device before petitions can be reviewed by community development. Once the petition is signed, notarized and returned to community development, it will be checked against tax records and land lot maps to insure it meets all requirements. For subdivisions not completely built out, a minimum of 60 percent of the total units within the subdivision must be occupied before a petition for the installation of traffic calming devices will be considered, and a minimum of 80 percent of the total units must be occupied before a petition for the removal of the devices will be considered. 
(b)  Speed criteria. Community development traffic studies must find a speeding problem does exist. The speed study will provide the 85th percentile speed, which must prove speeds are at least ten mph over the posted speed limit of 25 mph. The 85th percentile speed is an excellent indicator of street character and is used by nearly all states and cities for establishing regulatory speed limits. 
(c)  Removal process. Removal of traffic calming devices can proceed if the city is presented a petition requesting that the devices be removed. The petition must be completed following the same criteria defined in section 22-127(a). Such a petition for removal will only be considered after traffic calming devices have been in place for a period of at least one year. 
(d)  Design review process. All designs submitted to community development for traffic calming devices must meet all the requirements listed in sections 22-121, 22-124 and 22-125. Community development will review (allow up to 60 days) and possibly require modifications to the design. Once community development approves the design, it will be forwarded to the Villa Rica City Council for their consideration. 
(Ord. No. 13-16-CCO, § 7, 7-5-2016) 
Sec. 22-128. - General construction guidelines. 
(a)  Materials. All materials furnished and/or installed by the city shall be from sources certified by the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT), and shall meet all specifications set forth by GDOT. Hot mix recycled asphaltic concrete may be furnished and placed in lieu of virgin mix; in accordance with section 402 of the GDOT standard specifications. Any recycled material must be approved the community development department, and the finished work must meet the required density and gradation specifications set by GDOT standard specifications. 
(b)  Traffic control. The city shall furnish, install, maintain and remove all necessary traffic signs, barricades, lights, signals, cones and other traffic control devices; and all flagging and other means of traffic protection and guidance as required by the standard specifications of GDOT, and the MUTCD. 
(c)  Construction methods. All work performed for this project will be in accordance with GDOT Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges, Current Edition, and the Supplemental Specifications, Current Edition, and attached modifications and special provisions. 
(d)  Signs and pavement markings. The city will supply and install all signs, posts, hardware and pavement markings for each traffic calming device.

Sec. 26-83. - Methods of measuring volume or quantity of waste. 
    The volume or quantity of industrial waste discharged by a user into the sewer system shall be measured by one or more of the following methods: 
(1)  If the volume of water used by any user is substantially the same as the volume secured from the municipal waterworks system, then the volume of water purchased shall be considered to be the volume of waste discharged. 
(2)  If a substantial portion of the water secured by a user from the municipal waterworks system is not returned to the sewer system, the quantity of wastewater shall be determined as follows: 
a.  By a meter (or meters) on the water supply line (or lines) to the user's industrial and/or process operations not discharging to the sewer system; 
b.  By a meter (or meters) on the user's waste line (or lines) which discharges into the sewer system; or 
c.  If meters as required under subsection (2)a or b of this section shall not have been installed, or if at any time such installed meter (or meters) stop accurately recording flows discharged into the sewage system, the user shall immediately install or repair such meter (or meters). For the first 90 days from the enactment of the ordinance from which this section is derived, that such meter (or meters) are not installed or if installed, not accurately recording flows, the sewer charge will be based on the average percentage of flows calculated upon the previous three months flows. If after 90 days, the meter (or meters) are not installed or if installed are not operational, the sewer charge will be based on 100 percent of the volume of water purchased. If a sewer meter shows incorrect or suspected incorrect flows over four times in one 12-month period, then for the next 12-month period the sewer charge will be based on 100 percent of the volume of water purchased and will continue beyond such 12-month period until such time as it can be demonstrated to the city in a manner satisfactory to the city that the sewer meter is accurately measuring the sewerage flows. 
(3)  If any user, now discharging or proposing to discharge industrial waste into the sewer system, does not secure such user's entire water supply requirements from the municipal waterworks system, such user shall install and maintain a meter (or meters) on such user's waste line (or waste lines) which discharges into the sewer system or shall install such additional meters on the private water supply as required to permit determination of the total quantity discharged to the sewer system from both sources under procedures comparable to subsection (1) or (2) of this section.

Sec. 26-119. - Alternative and experimental on-site sewage management systems. 
(a)  General information. The city recognizes that on-site sewage management systems employing solids retention and on-site soil absorption of sewage effluent, if designed properly and installed in suitable soil, are usually ecologically safe and do adequately protect the public health. 
(1)  The city further recognizes that substantial portions of our jurisdiction's undeveloped land area are marginally suitable or totally unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, and that continued installation of such systems will have a detrimental effect on the public health. Where appropriate, and after thorough assessment of alternatives, the city will consider alternative on-site sewage management systems and/or modifications for areas with soils which may have marginal suitability in their present condition, including community-managed on-site sewage management systems and combinations of public or community sewage treatment systems and on-site sewage management systems. 
(2)  When considering proposals for alternative on-site sewage management systems, priority shall be given to those situations where the alternative system will resolve an existing sewage management problem. Any person or community desiring to install an alternative on-site sewage management system shall submit the following to the city: 
a.  Plans and specifications, along with any engineering, laboratory or field data required. 
b.  Information as required on the application for an individual on-site sewage management system construction permit, and any additional information as may be required by the city. If the proposal for the system is approved, the person making application will be informed by the city of any requirements for maintenance, and any monitoring procedures deemed necessary by the city. Reduction of water usage by the installation of water conserving fixtures and devices should be considered in overall strategy. 
(b)  Experimental on-site sewage management systems. The city may consider proposals for the use of experimental on-site sewage management systems. Acceptance or denial of such proposals shall depend on many site and system specific-factors, including a primary consideration that the remainder of the site is suitable for a conventional septic tank system in the event of failure of the experimental system.

B.  Erosion Control Details: Erosion Control Details and Symbols may be taken directly from the Manual For Erosion and Sediment Control In Georgia, current edition, referenced above. 
402.6  As-Built Drawings: At the completion of construction (and preferably prior to the final field inspection), "As-Built" drawings of the project shall be submitted to the city to serve as a permanent record of the project and shall be furnished in the form of one set of mylar sepias (or other suitable form of reproducible drawings) and two sets of blue line copies. Acceptance by the city will be made only after satisfactory as-built drawings have been submitted. As-built drawings will be in the same format as the original construction plans and normally will be an updated version of the construction plans. As-built drawings shall be prepared by the project design professional. Each sheet of these drawings shall bear words "As-Built" or "Record Drawings." 
Guidelines for preparation of As-Builts: 
1.  As-Built drawings will be same format as the original construction plans. 
2.  Contour lines are required. 
3.  Road names and lot numbers should be on plan.

402.7  Easement Acquisition and Utility Encroachment Permits: 
A.  It shall be the responsibility of the developer to obtain any off-site easements required to connect the project to existing public sewers. Easements will be conveyed to the City of Villa Rica for all facilities which are to be conveyed to the city. This process must be started early enough to allow construction of the sewer before any building construction is to begin. No building permits or sewer tap applications can be issued until off-site sewers have been constructed and accepted. This condition shall override any provision for speed up of house starts such as furnishing a bond to guarantee completion of the streets and other appurtenances. 
B.  All easements shall allow adequate room to construct the sewer and appurtenances. Permanent easements shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide, ten feet on each side of the line; except that when the depth of the sewer exceeds ten feet the required sewer easement width shall increase such that the easement width is at least twice the depth from the ground surface to bottom of the pipe. Designs involving utilities sharing a common easement will be coordinated with the utilities to insure adequate separation of utilities and overall easement width is achieved. 
C.  Easement drawings for work outside the development shall be furnished and recorded prior to approval of the sewer plans. The drawings shall be of a size suitable for legal recording and shall be prepared by a Registered Land Surveyor. The drawing will show property lines, the name of property owners with the length of line encroaching on each property owner, size of line, line designation, manhole numbers and stations, width of permanent and construction easement, scale of drawing, north arrow, land lot and district numbers, and a tie to the nearest land lot corner. Any streets or other existing easements shall also be shown. 
The title block shall be shown as follows:

Construction permits will not be issued until the utility encroachment permit has been obtained and until any special conditions such as insurance requirements have been complied with. 
(Ord. No. 04-18-CCO , Att., 5-1-2018) 
403. - Design Criteria and Materials for Sewers. 
403.1  General: The criteria listed herein is not intended to cover all aspects of design, but rather to mention the basic guidelines and those particulars that are required by the City of Villa Rica Water and Sewer Department. For more detailed criteria, the reader should refer to standard references such as "Ten States Standards," Georgia EPD rules, Water Pollution Environment Federation Manual of Practice NO. FD-5, and other available literature. 
403.2  Types of Sewers: All sewers for the conveyance of wastewater shall be designed as separate sanitary sewers in which groundwater, stormwater or other runoff from roofs, streets, parking lots, foundation drains and any source other than wastewater are excluded. Overflows from sewers shall not be permitted. 
403.3  Design Period: Gravity sewer pipelines should, as a minimum, be designed with capacity sufficient to handle the estimated tributary population. Tributary population is considered to be all areas upstream of the discharge point of the system being designed as well as any anticipated pumped flow from other basins. Sewers will be designed and installed to the uppermost property line of the development being served. Consideration should be given to the maximum anticipated capacity of institutions, industrial parks, etc. 
403.4  Capacity and Size Determinations: In determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers, the following factors should be considered: 
1.  Maximum hourly sewage flow. 
2.  Additional maximum sewage or waste flow from industrial plants. 
3.  Ground water infiltration. 
4.  Topography of the area. 
5.  Depth of excavation. 
    New sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily flow of sewage of not less than 400 gallons per household per day. Normally, all sewers shall be designed for a peak flow of not less than two and one-half times the average flow; this peak factor will be higher for smaller basins (see design guides). Sewers should be designed to carry the peak flow when flowing at a depth of two-thirds pipe diameter. The city land use plan should be consulted and special consideration given to commercial and industrial areas. Where developers are installing major trunk lines or interceptor sewers, the city's long-range plan should be consulted as a guide and the sewer should as a minimum be of the size called for in the long-range plan. If proposed land use conditions have changed subsequent to the plan, these changes should be factored into the determination. 
403.5  Special City Requirements: 
A.  Distance Between Manholes: Maximum distance between manholes shall be 400 feet. 
B.  Depth: Any sewers installed in the street shall, topography permitting, be sufficiently deep to provide five feet of cover over service laterals at the street right-of-way, and over any part of the main or service within the street right-of-way. The maximum depth for PVC pipe shall be 15 feet, depths in excess of this shall be ductile iron. Sewers installed in streets shall have maximum depth of 12 feet. Any sewers on off street easements shall have a minimum of four feet of cover unless ductile iron pipe is used. Filling over the pipe to obtain minimum cover is not allowed. 
C.  Drop Across Manholes: All manholes shall be provided with, a minimum vertical drop across the manhole (between in and out pipes) of 0.10 feet. 
D.  Detection tape shall be installed over all sewer pipe. Bury tape 18 to 24 inches below grade. Use detection wire on all service laterals. 
403.6  Slope: All sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than 2.0 feet per second based on Manning's formula using an "n" value of 0.013. The following are the minimum slopes which should be provided; however, slopes greater than these are desirable: 
Minimum Slope in Feet Sewer Size Per 100 Feet 8" 0.40 10" 0.29 12" 0.22 14" 0.17 15" 0.15 16" 0.14 18" 0.12 21" 0.10 24" 0.08  
    These minimum slopes will be used only when sufficient flows are expected to maintain a velocity of 2.0 feet per second and maintain a cleaning action in the line. Sewers shall be laid with uniform slope between manholes. Sewers on 20 percent slope or greater shall be ductile iron pipe and shall be anchored securely with concrete anchors (See Standard Details) to prevent displacement by erosion or shock. Maximum slope of sewers shall be 30 percent and sewers shall be designed at less than 20 percent whenever possible. 
403.7  Increasing Size: When a small sewer is connected to a large one, the connection shall not be lower than matching the top of both sewers to the same elevation. 
403.8  Gravity Sewer Pipe Materials: The city reserves the right to disallow any Manufacturer that does not have a consistent, long-term record of quality control and successful product performance. Gravity sanitary sewer pipe up through 15-inch diameter will normally be Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), solid wall type SDR 35 thickness meeting ASTM D3034. Ductile Iron Pipe (DIP) will be used where certain conditions exist (see discussion of D.I.P.). For 18-inch diameter pipe and above, the Contractor may have the option of using either Polyvinyl Chloride (P.V.C.), Reinforced Concrete Pipe (R.C.P.), or Ductile Iron Pipe. The city may approve other types of pipe on a case by case basis and may limit the options of type of pipe depending on site conditions. This should be addressed at the preliminary review stage. 
    Bedding for sewer pipe shall be as follows (also see city standard details): 
    For PVC the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six inches below bottom of pipe extending up to six inches above top of pipe for the full width of the trench.

404.5  Rock Excavation: Drilling and blasting operations shall be conducted with due regard for the safety of persons and property in the vicinity and in strict conformity with requirements of all ordinances, laws and regulations governing blasting and the use of explosives. Rock excavation near existing pipelines or other structures shall be conducted with the utmost care to avoid damage. Injury or damage to other structures and properties are the sole responsibility of the installation contractor and shall be promptly repaired by the Contractor to the satisfaction of the City and property owner. 
    Rock in trenches shall be excavated over the horizontal limits of excavation and to depths as follows: 
Size of Pipeline Inches Depth of Excavation Below Bottom of Sewer Pipe, Inches 4 to 8 6 8 to 18 8 18 to 30 10  
    The undercut space shall then be brought up to grade by backfilling with Size #57 crushed stone material or approved equal. 
404.6  Installation of Sewer Pipe: Construction stake-out will be required prior to construction of sewer lines. As a minimum, the horizontal alignment will be staked at 100-foot intervals and each manhole will be located with a centerline stake and two offset hubs. "Cuts" to invert elevations will be shown for each manhole entry and exit pipe. A copy of the stake-out notes will be provided to the city. 
    Pipe and accessories shall at all times be handled with care to avoid damage. Whether moved by hand, skidways or hoists, material shall not be dropped or bumped. The interior of all pipe shall be kept free from dirt and foreign matter at all times. Each joint of pipe shall be unloaded opposite or near the place where it is to be laid in the trench. 
    All such material that is defective in manufacture or has been damaged in transit or after delivery shall be removed from the job site. 
    Sewer pipes shall be joined by "push-on" joints using elastomeric gaskets to affect the pressure seal. The ends of pipe to be joined and the gaskets shall be cleaned immediately before assembly, and the assembly shall be made as recommended by the pipe manufacturer. Lubricant used must be non-toxic and supplied or approved for use by the pipe manufacturer. Sewer pipes shall be laid in the uphill direction with the bells pointing upgrade. Any variation from this procedure shall require approval from the City. 
    When pipe laying is not in progress, the open ends of installed pipe shall be plugged with a watertight plug to prevent entrance of trench water into the line. 
    Bedding for pipe shall normally be as listed below (also see city standard details): 
    For PVC the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six inches below bottom of pipe. For concrete and ductile iron pipe the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six inches below bottom of pipe and initial backfill to the top of pipe for the full width of the trench. 
    In wet areas, the minimum bedding requirements will be increased as required to ensure a stable support under the pipe and on the sides of the pipe. 
    Backfill material up to 12 inches above the top of the pipe shall be compacted dry, loose, soil unless PVC is used in which case the first six inches above the top of pipe is required to be crushed stone. If such material is not available from the site then #57 stone shall be used to backfill up to 12 inches above the top of the pipe. Backfilling the remainder of the trench may utilize soil and blasted rock (not over 12 inches in any dimension) compacted sufficiently to avoid excessive settlement. Under no circumstances will tree parts, vegetation, building materials or any other type of debris be used for backfill. 
    All backfill beneath roads, sidewalks or other critical areas shall be compacted to 95 percent Standard Proctor or as otherwise required by the D.O.T. or other such agency having jurisdiction using mechanical tamping equipment. Moisture control of the material may be required to achieve this compaction and hauling in of select material may be required. Compaction testing and certification by an independent soil testing company will be required in these areas at the Developers expense. 
404.7  Railroad Crossings: All railroad crossing shall conform to the requirements of the American Railway Engineering Association Manual for Railway Engineering, Part 5. The Contractor shall secure permission from the railroads to schedule the work so as not to interfere with the operation of the railroads. The Contractor shall be held responsible for any delays or damages occurring to the railroads. The Contractor will furnish the railroad with such additional insurance as may be required, cost of same to be borne by the Contractor, together with the costs for flagmen, watchmen, temporary work of any nature, safety devices and any other items that may be imposed by the railroad. 
404.8  Highway Crossings: All construction work in the State Highway right-of-way shall be approved by the Georgia Department of Transportation. Developer shall be responsible for obtaining encroachment permits. 
404.9  Stream Crossings: The preferred method of crossing a river, stream, creek, impoundments, or wet weather ditch is with a minimum of six inches of cover between the lowest point in the stream and the top of outside diameter of the pipe. Ductile iron pipe is required for all stream crossings and shall extend a minimum of ten feet beyond the top of bank on each side. Concrete collars or encasement must be provided at all joints for ductile iron pipe with less than three feet of cover. 
    The stream bed and sides at the crossing site shall be protected from erosion with the use of Rip-Rap, as defined and sized in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control In Georgia, Appendix C Construction Materials, 1992 or most current edition. 
    Aerial Crossings will require detailed plans and will be allowed only when, in the city's opinion there is no reasonable alternative. 
    Erosion control measures shall be installed prior to installing pipe across any stream. All work should be performed when stream flows are at their lowest, and all work should be performed as quickly and safely as possible. As soon as conditions permit, the stream bed shall be cleared of all falsework, debris, and other obstructions placed therein or caused by the construction operations. 
    Erosion control measures can include, but are not limited to, the following items: 
a.  Silt fencing, types A, B, and/or C. 
b.  Erosion control check dams. 
c.  Channel diversion through temporary storm drain pipe. 
d.  Rock filter dams. 
    The construction and installation of these various structures are detailed in the Manual for Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Georgia or the Georgia Department of Transportation Standards and Construction Details, both of which are available for purchase by the Contractor. 
404.10  Casing for Sewers: Where pipe is required to be installed under railroads, highways, streets or other facilities by jacking or boring methods, construction shall be done in a manner that will not interfere with the operation of the facility, and shall not weaken the roadbed or structure. 
    The diameter of the bore shall conform to the outside diameter and circumference of the casing pipe as closely as practicable. Any voids which develop during the installation operation shall be pressure grouted. Each segment of the casing pipe shall be welded (full circumference butt weld) to the adjoining segment. The completed casing shall have no sags or crowns which cause the grade for any segment to be less than the minimum slope for the size pipe being installed. 
    The carrier pipe shall be fitted with approved spacers to secure its position within the casing. At each end of the casing pipe the void between the carrier pipe and casing shall be sealed with brick and mortar. 
404.11  Replacement of Pavement: Contractor shall fully restore and replace all pavement, curbs, gutters, sidewalks and other surface structures removed or disturbed, to a condition that is equal to or better than the original condition in a manner satisfactory to the City (see standard details). 
404.12  Location/Protection of Existing Underground Utilities: It is the responsibility of the Contractor to locate all underground utilities and to protect same. Utility lines or services damaged by the Contractor shall be repaired by the Contractor at the Contractor's own expense. The Contractor has sole responsibility of complying with all provisions of the Utilities Protection Code. 
404.13  Protection of Water Supply and Other Utilities: The City of Villa Rica has an established Cross-Connection Program to prevent the entry of contaminants or pollutants into any area of the potable water supply through the control of cross connections. It is illegal to introduce any substance into or to have any cross connections with the potable water supply. There shall be no physical connection between a public or private potable water supply system and a sanitary sewer which would permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable water supply. 
    Whenever possible, sewers should be laid at least ten feet horizontally from any existing or proposed water main. Should conditions prevent a separation of ten feet, the lines shall be laid in separate trenches. 
404.14  Sewer Services: A sewer service shall be provided for every existing or proposed lot or building. All sewer services shall be a minimum of four inches in diameter unless otherwise specified. All service lines shall be designed to maintain a minimum of two feet/second sewer velocity. All services shall be shown on the construction and as-built drawings. A common service shall not be allowed for two or more buildings. The service shall extend to five feet inside the property line of the lot being served and normally be within ten feet of the lower corner of the lot. All service laterals shall be a minimum of five feet deep at the property line. Where five feet of cover cannot be achieved, sewer services shall be constructed of ductile iron. A 90 degree bend, constructed from two 45 degree fittings shall be installed at the end of all sewer services with a vertical section of pipe to extend a minimum of four feet above existing ground level (See Standard Details). Connections to the main exceeding eight feet in depth may have the saddle or tee rotated to a bend inserted in the service to provide five feet lateral depth at the property line. 
    The developer shall be responsible for serving all lots developed. On any lot where the service cannot be found, the developer shall be responsible for payment of the cost of installation of the service. Also, unless noted on the final plat, the service shall be low enough to serve the first-floor elevation at the building line. Install 14-gauge detector wire on all laterals. 
    The builder shall be responsible for the location of the service prior to the pouring of the foundation, driveway or other appurtenance. The City will not be responsible for any house built too low to be served nor for any service covered by construction. 
    No plumber or contractor will be allowed to connect to the sewerage system except to the end of the service provided for his connection. Also, any service provided will be utilized without the installation of additional services. 
404.15  Clean-Up: Prior to requesting the "completion of sewer construction" inspection, the Contractor shall remove and dispose of in an acceptable manner all shipping timbers, shipping bands, spacers, excess materials, broken material, crates, boxes and any other material brought to the job site. 
    Any work areas within public right-of-way or property outside of the development that were damaged by the sewer construction shall be repaired or replaced with the same kind of material as existed prior to the damage occurring. All easement areas shall be cleared of trees, stumps and other debris and left in a condition such that the easement can be maintained by bush-hog equipment. 
    All shoulders, ditches, culverts, and other areas impacted by the sewer construction shall be at the proper grades and smooth in appearance. 
    All manhole covers shall be brought to grade. 
    A uniform stand of grass or mulch for erosion protection, as defined in the Manual For Erosion and Sediment Control In Georgia, is required over all construction easements and sanitary sewer easements prior to the City's acceptance of the sewer. Use a grass mixture consisting of at least 50 percent fescue. 
(Ord. No. 04-18-CCO , Att., 5-1-2018) 
405. - Inspection of Sewers. 
405.1  City Inspection: The developer's contractor will be responsible for the quality, accuracy and workmanship of his completed work. 
    City personnel will visit the job site on a periodic basis and will make spot checks as they deem appropriate. The City of Villa Rica shall have the right to review and inspect all construction and may reject any work that does not meet quality control standards. 
405.2  Access to Project: Authorized representatives of the City of Villa Rica, which may include city employees, the city engineer, state or federal agencies, shall have access to the site for inspection at any time. 
405.3  Communications During Construction: A preconstruction conference will be required for all projects. The Developer has sole responsibility for scheduling. The Developer, design professional, contractor, and subcontractor(s) are required to meet with the City and all private utilities in this conference. The contractor will notify the city in writing two days before starting construction. The contractor will provide notification by phone any time the work is to be vacated and will provide notice by phone prior to resuming work. The contractor shall request the final inspection. 
    The city inspector may have informal verbal communications with the contractor foreman or superintendent at any time during construction. The city inspector will not direct the actions of contractor's workmen. 
405.4  Concealed Work: The city inspector may direct that the contractor notify the city and receive inspection approval prior to concealing certain work such as manhole foundations, pipe bedding, tees, bends, service laterals, or other appurtenances. At the City's discretion, the City may require work to be uncovered which was not inspected prior to backfilling. 
405.5  Minimum Inspection by Developer: The following minimum information shall be determined and certified by the engineer: 
1.  Horizontal location. Horizontal location of the line will be checked by measuring "as-built" distances between manholes and bearings from manhole to manhole. 
2.  Elevation and slope. Elevation of each invert and top of manhole will be measured and recorded. Actual pipe slope will be computed and any segment having less than minimum allowable slope will be rejected and re-done. 
405.6  City Inspection: Cost for all testing shall be paid for by the developer. 
1.  Manhole construction. Manholes will be visually inspected to check for plugging of lift holes, use of connecting boots, use of joint material, leakage, proper invert construction, proper setting of frame and cover. 
2.  Pipe straightness. Sections of sewer line will be visually checked for straightness. A passing section shall show at least 80 percent of a full circle when observed from one end. Any section which fails this visual test shall be further checked. 
The section shall have water run through it sufficient to fill any sags that may exist. Then it shall have a television camera pulled through it to check for sags. Any sag holding more than one and one-half inches of water will require that the pipe be removed and replaced to proper grade after which the section shall be televised again to verify correction. The contractor may propose alternative methods other than televising sewers for the City's approval to determine failing sections of sewers. 
3.  Infiltration. The allowable limit for any section from manhole to manhole will be 100 gallons per day per inch of pipe diameter per mile of pipe. If any infiltration is present at the most downstream point, then it will be measured using a specially-made weir and measurements will also be made at each upstream manhole that has any visible flow of water. Any individual segment which exceeds the allowable infiltration shall be corrected to within allowable limits. 
4.  Compaction of backfill. Compaction testing may be required for sewers constructed in paved areas or where pavement is planned. A minimum of two tests per 500 feet of trench line located in roadways will be required. If any of these tests show failing results, then the failing backfill will be removed, re-compacted and re-tested, and one additional area will be tested as well. 
405.7  Other Testing Requirements: The tests listed below shall be performed by the contractor in the presence of the City. The city will be notified at least two days prior to these tests. 
A.  Mandrel Test for PVC Pipe: Procedure for testing PVC sewer pipe for maximum allowable deflection shall be generally as follows (Mandrel sized to 95 percent of the nominal internal pipe diameter): 
1.  Completely flush the line making sure the pipe is clean of any mud or trash that would hinder the passage of the mandrel. 
2.  During the final flushing of the line, attach a floating block or ball to the end of the mandrel pull rope and float the rope through the line. (A nylon ski rope is recommended). 
3.  After the rope is threaded through the line, connect the pull rope to the mandrel and place the mandrel in the entrance of the pipe. 
4.  Connect a second rope to the back of the mandrel. This will enable the mandrel to be retrieved if excessive deflection is encountered. 
5.  Draw the mandrel through the sewer line. 
6.  An increasing resistance to pull is an indication of excessive deflection. If this occurs mark the rope to note the location. Televise the sewer section to identify the extent of the problem and develop a plan, subject to city approval, for correcting the problem. The contractor may propose an alternative method other than televising sewers for the City's approval to determine locations of failing sewers. 
7.  Retest. 
B.  Air Pressure Test: A low pressure test of each sewer line section will be conducted by the contractor to check for leaks. The following general procedures will apply (also refer to ASTM specs): 
1.  Temporarily plug the line segment between two manholes using plugs having air tight fittings through which low pressure air can be introduced into the pipe segment being tested. 
2.  Introduce low pressure air into the test pipe segment until the internal air pressure reaches 4.5 psig above ground water pressure, if any. 
3.  Wait at least five minutes for air temperature in the test segment to stabilize while internal air pressure remains no less than 3.5 psig above ground water pressure. 
4.  Bleed internal air pressure to exactly 3.5 psig above ground water pressure. 
5.  Accurately determine the elapsed time for internal pressure to drop to 2.5 psig above ground water pressure. 
6.  The air test is acceptable if elapsed time is no less than shown by the following table: 
Pipe Dia. Inches Seconds Per 100 Ft. of Pipe Pipe Dia. Inches Seconds Per 100 Ft. of Pipe 4 11 27 77 6 17 30 85 8 23 36 102 10 28 42 119 12 34 48 136 15 43 54 153 18 51 60 170 21 60 66 187 24 68 72 204  
Air leakage time is based on pipe being damp. If pipe and joints are dry, dampen line if helpful in meeting air test time requirement. 
Permanently correct excessive leakage determined by air testing, and repeat operations until City witnesses a successful test on each line segment. 
Note: Upon request, the city may allow substitution of exfiltration test in lieu of air pressure test. If used, the exfiltration test will be conducted with a minimum water head of two feet above the groundwater table and the allowable exfiltration will be limited to 100 gallons per day per inch diameter of pipe per mile of pipe. 
C.  Manhole Testing: All manholes require testing by either the vacuum test or exfiltration test. 
1.  Exfiltration Test: Manholes which have been backfilled around shall be tested for exfiltration. The minimum test time duration is one hour. Manholes shall be filled with water to the top of ring. The maximum allowable exfiltration rate is two gal./ft. of depth/ft. of manhole diameter. 
2.  Vacuum Test: Vacuum testing of manholes for water tightness may be used in lieu of the exfiltration test prior to backfilling. After temporarily plugging pipe openings and installing the vacuum base on top of the cone, a vacuum of ten inches of Mercury shall be drawn and the vacuum pump shut off. With valves closed, the pressure shall be monitored for a time period of 60 seconds. At the end of the test period, if the vacuum is nine inches or greater, the manhole has passed the test. If the vacuum drops below nine inches, the manhole has failed. 
405.8  Final Inspection and Conditional Acceptance: In no circumstances shall any buildings and plumbing fixtures be connected to the sewers until inspected and approved by the City. 
    The contractor shall request in writing a final inspection. This final inspection will generally include spot checks of manholes and sewer lines and a complete overview of the project. 
    After any discrepancies are corrected, the city will issue a letter certifying conditional acceptance of the sewer system. This letter shall commence the start of the 18-month warranty period which is required of the contractor. 
    On projects having phased development, this letter will allow the developer to apply for a permit for the next phase of development. 
    At the end of 18 months, the subdivision inspection team will again re-inspect the entire development. When all discrepancies have been corrected, the city will issue an acceptance letter and will begin perpetual maintenance and operation of the sewerage system. 
405.9  Maintenance Bond or Letter of Credit: The developer shall post a maintenance bond or Letter of Credit of 25 percent of the total project cost on the facility for an 18-month period after completion and conditional acceptance of the facility by the City of Villa Rica for all projects whose costs exceeds $20,000.00. Bonds are to be written where the City of Villa Rica must release the bond in writing. Bond expiration dates for release are not acceptable. 
405.10  Maintenance until Final Acceptance: It shall be the developer's obligation to provide all maintenance for an 18-month period after conditional acceptance of the project by the City of Villa Rica. At the end of the 18-month maintenance period the City shall inspect the sewer system, and upon correction by the developer of all deficiencies noted by the City, the City will accept the sewer system for operation.

B.  All work shall conform to the applicable provisions of the AWWA Specifications of latest revision except as otherwise specified herein. 
506.2  Trench Excavation: 
A.  Trenches shall have a minimum width of 24 inches or the diameter of the outside of the bell of the water main plus 12 inches, (whichever is greater), and the depth thereof shall be such that there shall be a minimum of 42 inches of cover measured below the roadway surface, natural ground, or proposed grade to the top of the pipe. In cases where water lines cross sanitary sewers, there shall be a minimum of two feet vertical separation between the water and sewer mains. In cases where water mains parallel sewer mains there shall be a minimum of ten feet horizontal separation maintained between the mains. 
Trenches shall be dug so that the pipe can be laid to the alignment and depth required, and the trench shall be of such width and shall be braced and drained so that the workmen may work therein safely and efficiently. No chocking under the pipe will be permitted. All joints shall be as specified herein. Excavation must be made under the bell of each pipe so that the entire length of the pipe will lie uniformly on the bottom of the trench and the pipe weight shall not rest on the bells. Trenches shall be free of water during the work. 
Water lines shall have a minimum cover of 42 inches. All changes in grade shall be made gradually. At points of interference with storm sewers and cross drains, pipe will be run under the conflicting utility if the minimum cover cannot be maintained by going over the top of the pipe. 
In laying pipe across water courses, railroad crossings, or depressions of any kind, the minimum depth here specified shall be maintained at the bottom of the depression. 
Where necessary, the line shall be lowered at valves so that the top of the valve stem is approximately one foot below the finished grade. The trench shall be deepened to provide a gradual approach to all low points of the line. 
B.  Wherever rock is encountered in the excavation, it shall be removed by suitable means. If blasting is used for removal of rock, the contractor shall take all proper safety precautions. He shall comply with all rules and regulations for the protection of life and property that may be imposed by any public body having jurisdiction relative to the handling, storing and use of explosives. Before blasting, the Contractor shall cover the excavation with heavy timbers and mats in such a manner as to protect the adjacent property owners from damage. All rock encountered shall be removed six inches below the bottom grade of the trench and the trench built back to the correct grade with suitable material tamped into place. Sides of the trench shall be trimmed of projecting rock that will interfere with backfilling operations. The Contractor shall be wholly responsible for any damage resulting from blasting. Rock excavation by blasting shall be at least 75 feet in advance of pipe laying. 
C.  After the pipe has been laid, backfilling shall be performed in two distinct operations. In general, all backfill beneath, around and to a depth of 24 inches above the top of the pipe shall be placed in six inch layers for the full width of the trench and thoroughly compacted by hand with vibratory equipment. Care shall be taken so that the pipe is not laterally displaced during backfilling operations. The backfill lifts shall be placed by an approved method in accordance with that hereinafter specified. Backfill materials shall be the excavated materials without bricks, stone, foreign matter or corrosive materials, where not otherwise specified or indicated on the plans. 
D.  Backfill under permanent concrete or bituminous pavement and as elsewhere specified or indicated on the plans shall be as shown in the Standard Detail Drawings for trenches in paved areas. Mechanical vibrating equipment shall be used to achieve the required compaction. 
E.  Backfill under gravel or crushed stone surfaced roadways and low-type bituminous surfaced roadways shall be approved suitable excavated material placed in 12 inch layers and thoroughly compacted for the full depth and width of the trench, conforming to the compaction, density compaction method and materials as specified in "D" above. 
F.  Backfill in unpaved areas shall be compacted with mechanical vibrating equipment to 95 percent as determined by the Standard Proctor Test. Trenches shall be compacted so they will not settle. If settlement occurs, trenches are to be refilled, re-compacted and re-graded. Backfill material from pipe bedding to ground surface shall be excavated earth free from large stones and other debris. 
G.  Contractor shall fully restore and replace all pavement, surface structures, grassing, landscaping, etc., removed or disturbed as part of the work to a condition equal to that before the work began. All pavement removal shall be replaced per Standard Detail Drawings.

600. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT/FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE 
Introduction 
It is hereby determined that: 
The flood hazard areas of the City of Villa Rica are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, stream bank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can (1) Protect human life and health; (2) Minimize damage to private property; (3) Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Villa Rica does ordain this ordinance and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.

The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the City of Villa Rica, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
    Substantially Improved Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

604. - Standards for Development. 
604.1  Definition of Floodplain Boundaries. 
1.  Studied "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available. 
2.  For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the future-conditions flood elevations shall be provided by the City of Villa Rica. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the City of Villa Rica, then it shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Villa Rica. 
604.2  Definition of Floodway Boundaries. 
1.  The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the City of Villa Rica. If floodway data is not available from the City of Villa Rica, then it shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Villa Rica. 
604.3  General Standards. 
1.  No development shall be allowed within the future-conditions floodplain that could result in any of the following: 
a.  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
b.  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
c.  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or, 
d.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
2.  Any development within the future-conditions floodplain allowed under 1. above shall also meet the following conditions: 
a.  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
b.  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
c.  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
d.  Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of Section 604.4; 
e.  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters; and 
f.  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) or Conditional Letter of Map Amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the City of Villa Rica using the Community Consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys for a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). 
604.4  Engineering Study Requirements for Floodplain Encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of Section 605.4 apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered Professional Engineer in the State of Georgia and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the City of Villa Rica prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
1.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
2.  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the City of Villa Rica. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
3.  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
4.  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
604.5  Floodway Encroachments. Located within Areas of Special Flood Hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in 2. below. 
2.  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
3.  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the City of Villa Rica until an affirmative Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the City of Villa Rica. 
604.6  Maintenance Requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The City of Villa Rica may direct the property owner (at no cost to the City of Villa Rica) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the City of Villa Rica.

A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the City of Villa Rica or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein above. 
1.  Requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance shall be submitted to the City of Villa Rica. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the City of Villa Rica. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
2.  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the City of Villa Rica shall have the right to appeal such decision to the Villa Rica City Manager. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
3.  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Villa Rica City Manager shall have the right to appeal such decision to the Villa Rica City Council. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
4.  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Villa Rica City Council may appeal such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction, as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
5.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of Historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a Historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
6.  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this Section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
7.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
8.  In reviewing such requests, the City of Villa Rica shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this ordinance. 
9.  Conditions for Variances: 
a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
(i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
b.  The provisions of this ordinance are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of a Historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
d.  The City of Villa Rica shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
10.  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the City of Villa Rica shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.

(Ord. No. 04-18-CCO , Att., 5-1-2018) 
704. - Minimum Requirements for Erosion and Sedimentation Control Using Best Management Practices. 
A.  General Provisions: Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of Section 704 of this ordinance. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity. 
B.  BMPs: Best Management Practices 
1.  Best management practices as set forth in Section 704 of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
2.  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the City of Villa Rica or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
3.  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the City of Villa Rica or any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
4.  The Director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
C.  Minimum Requirements: The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
1.  Stripping of vegetation, re-grading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
2.  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
3.  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
4.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
5.  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
6.  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
7.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
8.  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
9.  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
10.  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
11.  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
12.  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
13.  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
14.  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Section 704(B)(2.) of this article; 
15.  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
i.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
ii.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbance activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
16.  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
i.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
ii.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
17.  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent the City of Villa Rica from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Section 704(B)(2) and (3) of this article. 
18.  In non-trout streams like those in Villa Rica, the State requires a minimum 25-foot vegetated buffer extending from the stream bank or the point of wrested vegetation. However, in the City of Villa Rica these State standards have been extended to require a minimum 50-foot stream buffer with an additional 25-foot setback for any impervious surfaces. 
19.  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 04-18-CCO , Att., 5-1-2018) 
705. - Application/Permit Process.

They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Villa Rica. However, the operator is the only party who may obtain a permit. 
705.1.  Application Requirements: 
A.  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Villa Rica without first obtaining a permit from the City of Villa Rica Community Development Department to perform such activity. 
B.  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Villa Rica Community Development Department and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in Section 704(C) of this ordinance. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of Section 705.2 of this ordinance. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board. 
C.  The following fees shall be assessed: 
a.  Initial Application Fee: $500.00 
b.  Re-Application Fee: $50.00 each occurrence 
c.  Land Disturbance Permit: $250.00

5.  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division; regardless of the existence of the City of Villa Rica in the jurisdiction. 
D.  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the City of Villa Rica shall refer the application and plan to the District for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A District shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a District to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the District review shall be forwarded to the City of Villa Rica. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the District, and any variances required by Section 704 B. and C. and bonding, if required as per Section 705.1 F. have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the City of Villa Rica and the District have entered into an agreement which allows the City of Villa Rica to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the District. 
E.  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the City of Villa Rica may deny the permit application. 
F.  The City of Villa Rica may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this ordinance or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the City of Villa Rica may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the City of Villa Rica with respect to alleged permit violations. 
705.2  Plan Requirements: 
A.  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in Section 705.2 B. and C. of this ordinance. Conformance with the minimum requirements may be attained through the use of design criteria in the current issue of the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the State Soil and Water Conservation Commission as a guide; or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this ordinance.

800. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT 
Introduction. 
It is hereby determined that: 
Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both State and Federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; 
Therefore, the City of Villa Rica has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
(Ord. No. 04-18-CCO , Att., 5-1-2018) 

801. - General Provisions. 
801.1  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This ordinance seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
1.  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
2.  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
3.  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
4.  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
5.  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
6.  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
7.  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
801.2  Applicability. 
1.

b.  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
c.  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the Ordinance Administrator to be a hotspot land use; or, 
d.  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items (a.) and (b.) above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
2.  The following activities are exempt from this ordinance: 
a.  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
b.  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures;

2.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
3.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the City of Villa Rica are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
804.2  Stream Channel Protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
1.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
2.  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; 
3.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
804.3  Overbank Flooding Protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under Section 9.4, B is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
804.4  Extreme Flooding Protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
804.5  Structural Stormwater Controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from City of Villa Rica before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the City of Villa Rica may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
804.6  Stormwater Credits for Nonstructural Measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under Section 804.1. The applicant may, if approved by the City of Villa Rica, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
804.7  Drainage System Guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more than one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements:

CHAPTER III - NONCONFORMITIES
Sec. 3.01- INTENT
1) This Ordinance allows legally established nonconforming uses based on the fact that within the districts established by this Ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted there exist lots, uses of land, structures, and uses of structures and land in combination which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed and amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or future amendments; and
2) It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit legally established nonconforming uses, buildings, sites, and structures to continue until they are removed, abandoned, or fully conform with this Ordinance, but not to encourage their survival in nonconforming status. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that legal nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district without approval from the Villa Rica City Council in accordance with Section 2.04  Villa Rica City Council, in this Article.
Sec. 3.02 - NONCONFORMING STATUS
1) The determination of status of Illegal Nonconforming and Legal Nonconforming (Grandfathered) uses, buildings, structures, or lots shall be based on the definition for each type of nonconforming use as they appear in Chapter XIII: Definitions.
a) Illegal Nonconforming. An illegal nonconforming use, structure, or lot shall be subject to actions and penalties allowed by this Ordinance and shall be altered to conform with all applicable standards and regulations of this Ordinance and all other applicable City ordinances.
b) Legal Nonconforming (Grandfathered). Legal nonconforming differs from illegal nonconforming in that the reason for the nonconformance is caused by the enactment of a Zoning Ordinance or a change to a Zoning Ordinance (including the official Zoning Map). Legally established nonconforming use of structures and/or land may continue operation or use in conformance with this Chapter.
Sec. 3.03 - INCOMPATIBILITY OF A NONCONFORMING USE
1) Legally established nonconforming uses are declared by this Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts in which the use is located. A legally established nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be extended, expanded or enlarged after passage of this Ordinance.
Sec. 3.04 AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP
1) Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently.

10 | P a g e Unified Development Code  ARTICLE 3  ZONING
Sec. 3.05 - NONCONFORMING LOT OF RECORD
1) Any legally established lot, as defined by this Ordinance, having less than the required minimum lot area or minimum lot width and frontage required by the applicable zoning district regulations of this Ordinance, may be deemed to be an exception to such minimum lot area or minimum lot width and frontage. This provision may apply even though such lots fail to meet the requirements for area, width, frontage, or any combination required by the applicable zoning district regulations of this Ordinance.
2) All other development standards for the applicable zoning district must be met unless property is determined to be an infill development.
Sec. 3.06 - NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND
1) Where, at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, lawful uses of land exist which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Ordinance, the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided:
a) a nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance;
b) a nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot other than that occupied by the uses at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance;
c) a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of an existing structure which was plainly arranged or designed for such use at the effective date of this Ordinance or its subsequent amendments, but no such use shall be extended to occupy land outside of the structure;
d) if a nonconforming use of land is discontinued or abandoned for more than one (1) year, the subsequent use of the land shall conform to the regulations specified by this Ordinance for the zoning district in which the land is located; and
e) no additional building or structure not conforming to the requirements of this Ordinance shall be erected in connection with a nonconforming use of land.
Sec. 3.07 - NONCONFORMING BUILDING OR STRUCTURE
1) CONTINUANCE OF LEGAL NONCONFORMING USE/STRUCTURE. Where a lawful building or structure exists, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, that could not be built under the terms of this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, location on the lot, bulk, or other requirements concerning the building or structure, the building or structure may remain so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
a) A nonconforming building or structure may not be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any building or structure may be altered to decrease its nonconformity;
b) Any nonconforming building or use which is damaged or destroyed, by fire, explosion, or Act of God, may be restored or replaced to the extent of its existence immediately prior to such damage or destruction, provided that required permits for such restoration or replacement are secured, work on restoration or replacement is initiated within a period of one year (12 months) from the date of the damage or destruction, and such restoration or replacement complies with any nuisance abatement requirements. In addition, with the exception of single-family detached dwellings, such restoration or replacement shall comply with current building, architectural, and zoning code structural and dimensional requirements; and
CHAPTER III  NONCONFORMITIES
City of Villa Rica, Georgia
__________________________________________________________________________________________
Unified Development Code  ARTICLE 3  ZONING 11 | P a g e
c) If a nonconforming building or structure is altered or moved for any reason for any distance or replaced, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located and the discontinued legal nonconforming features shall not be resumed.
2) EXCEPTION. A legal nonconforming single-family or two-family residence and/or its accessory structures which are located in a non-residential zoning district, but within an area that has developed primarily as a residential neighborhood, may be expanded and the expansion shall be for the purpose of continuing the residential use of the property. The residential structure shall comply with the current setbacks required in the zoning district which most resembles the existing residential development in the area.
a) Any nonconforming structure or portion of a non-conforming structure may be altered to decrease its nonconformity, or in a way that neither increases nor decreases the non-conformity.

Sec. 3.08 - REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE
1) On any legally established building or structure, or portion of a building or structure, or a building or structure containing a legally established nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of bearing and non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that the cubic area existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or structure or portion of any building or structure declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
2) If a legally established building or structure or portion of a building or structure or a building or structure containing a legally established nonconforming use becomes unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition and is razed, such building or structure shall not thereafter be rebuilt or used except in conformity with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
Sec. 3.09  RESTORATION OF A DESTROYED NONCONFORMING USE
1) A non-conforming building which has been damaged by accidental fire, explosion, or act of God to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its reproduction value shall not be restored except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. When damaged by less than fifty percent (50%) of its reproduction value, a non-conforming building may be repaired or reconstructed and used as before the time of damage, provided that all portions of the structure being restored are not and were not on or over the property line, the non-conformity is not increased, and a Certificate of Occupancy is issued within one year of the date of the damage.
Sec. 3.10 - DETERMINATION OF A NONCONFORMING USE
1) In circumstances where there is question whether or not a legal nonconforming use exists, it shall be decided by the Community Development Director.
Sec. 3.11  TRANSITIONAL USES IN MIXED-USE DISTRICTS
1) In the Commercial Mixed Use (CMU) zoning district, existing single-family residential structures may continue to function as legally nonconforming uses under Chapter III - Nonconformities of this ordinance.
2) Structures originally constructed for single-family residential use, may be converted to a neighborhood commercial use in Table 4.3: Permitted and Conditional Uses, subject to commercial building codes and off-street parking requirements for specific development types.
3) Structures originally developed as single-family residential uses, and converted to a commercial use, may be restored to a single-family residential use so long as applicable residential building codes have been met.
4) Structures developed for commercial use shall not be converted to a residential use, except for a commercial/residential mixed-use conversion, where residential living space is located above a commercial use at street-level.

Sec. 4.03  PERMITTED AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES
1) Permitted and Special Exception Use Table
a) Within Table 4.3: Permitted and Special Exception Land Uses, specific uses located in the left column are designated as either Permitted Uses, Permitted with Conditions, and Permitted by Special Exception (Conditional Use). If there is no designation, the use is not permitted within that district.
b) A Development Plan may be required as per Section 11.03  Development Plan Review and Approval.
2) USE CLASSIFICATIONS
a) Permitted uses. Permitted uses are those uses allowed without special permission of the Villa Rica City Council, given that they follow the standards and requirements set forth in this ordinance.
b) Special Exceptions. Special Exceptions are those uses that, because of potential incompatibility and negative impact on surrounding land uses, require additional review in order to determine compliance with City of Villa Rica standards and to determine their suitability in a given location. In order to achieve balance between the public benefit and the local impact, Special Exceptions are only permitted following a public hearing and approval by the Villa Rica City Council, as per Section 2.04  Villa Rica City Council and Section 11.08  Special Exception Procedure.
c) Unlisted or Questionable Land Uses. Any use listed within Section 4.03  Permitted and Special Exception uses but not designated as either permitted or Special Exception within a specific zoning district on the table shall be not permitted within the specific zoning district. If a use is not listed on the table, the requirements of the most similar use may be imposed according to a determination by the Director. This determination may be appealed to the Villa Rica City Council consistent with the provisions of Section 11.10  Administrative Appeals Procedure for Administrative Appeal Applications.
3) USES PERMITTED PER LOT. Only one (1) principal use (whether a permitted or Special Exception use) of a lot shall be permitted. All other uses occurring on a lot shall be accessory to or a subordinate component of the principal use (e.g. a shopping center would be considered the principal use).
4) ACCESSORY USES. Accessory uses and structures shall be incidental to, and commonly associated with the operation of, the principal use of the lot. Accessory use standards and requirements are listed in Sec. 8.02  Accessory Structure and Use Standards.

Unified Development Code  ARTICLE 3  ZONING 21 | P a g e
Sec. 4.04  LOT STANDARDS
1) Purpose. Lot Standards for each district dictate the minimum and/or maximum standards that apply to lots within certain zoning districts. These regulations for property developed within City of Villa Ricas jurisdiction are shown on Table 4.4: Residential Lot Standards and Table 4.5: Non-Residential Lot Standards.
2) Interpreting the Lot Standards Tables. The following explanations of terms should be consulted when interpreting Table 4.4: Residential Lot Standards and Table 4.5: Non-Residential Lot Standards. For more information on the meaning of terms in this ordinance, see Chapter XIII: Definitions.
a) Minimum Lot Size. The smallest area established by this ordinance on which a use, structure or building may be located in a particular district and which does not include any street right-of-way.
b) Minimum Lot Width. This refers to the minimum width a lot must have in order to be considered developable by this ordinance. The minimum lot width is the minimum allowable horizontal distance between the side property lines of a lot measured at right angles to its depth along a straight line parallel to the front lot line at the front setback line. Lot width on cul-de-sac lots and other lots with curving frontages is measured as a line parallel to the frontage and at the front setback line.
c) Minimum Lot Frontage. The frontage of a lot shall be construed to be the portion nearest the street. For the purpose of determining setback requirements on corner lots and through lots, all sides of a lot adjacent to streets shall be considered frontages. The minimum length of a lot frontage shall be measured between side lot lines at the street right-of-way or private street easement. Lots that have more than one frontage may combine the width of both frontages to meet the minimum lot frontage standard.
d) Maximum Building Height. The maximum allowable vertical distance of a building or structure. Building height shall be defined as the vertical distance as measured from the average elevation of the proposed finished grade at the front of the building to the highest point of the roof for flat roofs, to the deck line of mansard roofs, and the mean height between eaves and ridge for gable, hip and gambrel roofs. Certain height exceptions are permitted according to the provisions of Section 7.07  Height Standards.
i) Exceptions to height limits. The height limitations of this chapter shall not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas and domes not intended for human occupancy, monuments, water towers, observation towers, transmission towers, chimneys, smokestacks, conveyors, flagpoles, masts and aerials.
e) Minimum Building Lines.
i) The minimum yards (setbacks) for all structures shall be established in Chapter IV, Table 4.4 and Table 4.5 in the Villa Rica Zoning Ordinance subject to the following requirements:
ii) Permitted Encroachments into Yards. The following encroachments shall be allowed to the extent specified below.
iii) Non-residential. Canopies and awnings shall be allowed over walkways or driveways to within twelve (12) feet of the street right-of-way or the right-of-way based on the street's functional classification, whichever is farther from the street's centerline. Fuel pumps and pump islands, when permitted, shall be set back as stated in this paragraph for canopies.
iv) Single-family residential and townhouses used for single family on individual lots of record. Porches, decks or patios attached to the main dwelling may extend no more than ten feet into a

minimum front or rear yard. Outdoor fireplaces and outdoor uncovered kitchens, whether stand alone or constructed as a part of a patio, retaining wall or other structure, may only be located in the rear yard and may extend no more than ten (10) feet into the minimum rear yard. In no case shall an outdoor fireplace be located closer than ten (10) feet to a property line. Awnings may project to within five feet of a side lot line.
v) All zoning districts. Architectural features such as cornices, eaves, steps, stoops, gutters, fire chases, chimneys which are a part of an exterior wall of the primary structure, and fire escapes may not encroach or project over more than thirty-six (36) inches (3 feet) into any minimum yard. Wheelchair ramps and associated walkways shall be exempt from these requirements.
vi) Adjoining railroads. There shall be no minimum rear yard requirement adjoining the siding for those uses which utilize a rail siding for loading and unloading.
vii) Building Lot Lines (setbacks).
(1) Front Setback. The horizontal space between the Front lot line and the Front Setback line, extending to the side lines of the lot, generally parallel with and measured from the front lot line, defining the area in which no building or structure may be located above ground, except as may be provided in this ordinance. The front setback applies to all frontages of a lot facing a street or right-of-way.
(2) Side Setback. The horizontal space between the side lot lines and the side setback lines, extending to the front and rear lot lines, generally parallel with and measured from each side lot line, defining the area in which no building or structure may be located above ground, except as may be provided in this ordinance. However, for corner and through lots, any side of a structure that faces a street shall meet front setback requirements.
(3) Rear Setback. The horizontal space between the rear lot line and the rear setback line, extending to the side lines of the lot, generally parallel with and measured from the rear lot line, defining the area in which no building or structure may be located above ground, except as may be provided in this ordinance. For through lots, the rear of the structure facing a street shall meet front setback requirements. rear Setbacks for Corner lots will apply to the portion of the lot that is furthest in the opposite direction of the general orientation of the structure.
viii) Corner lots. Principal structures on corner lots shall be required to identify a main entrance. Said entrance shall be setback as specified in the front yard setback regulations for the applicable zoning district. The setback for the other street-adjoining side shall be as specified in the district regulations.
f) Front Setbacks and Roadway Classifications.
i) Front Yard Setbacks are intended to establish a visual buffer distinguishing the building line from the roadway. Based on the traffic volume and roadway width, whether in a rural or urban setting, building setbacks are varied according to the road classification, with greater setbacks on larger streets with higher volume traffic, and lesser setbacks on smaller less travelled streets.
ii) Roadways are grouped into functional classes according to the character of traffic they are intended to serve. They may also be further classified as rural or urban based on the population surrounding a particular roadway. There are four highway functional classifications: expressway/freeway, arterial, collector, and local roads, and these can be defined as:
CHAPTER IV  ZONING DISTRICTS
City of Villa Rica, Georgia
__________________________________________________________________________________________
Unified Development Code  ARTICLE 3  ZONING 23 | P a g e
(1) Interstate - Provides the highest level of service at the greatest speed for the longest uninterrupted distance, with some degree of access control.
(2) Arterial - Provides the next highest level of service at moderate to high speeds, with some degree of access control. Arterials are typically classified as major arterial and minor arterial.
(3) Collector - Provides a lower level of service at a lower speed for shorter distances by collecting traffic from local roads and connecting them with arterials. Collectors are also classified as major and minor collectors.
(4) Local - Consists of all roads not defined as arterials or collectors; primarily provides access to land with little or minimal through movement.
g) Minimum Distance Between Structures on Same lot. This distance, measured between the points of shortest distance on the exterior facades of two (2) structures, shall determine the minimum separation of multiple structures within one (1) developed lot.
h) Minimum Ground Floor Living Area (Per unit). The sum of the livable horizontal areas on the ground level of a building measured from the interior faces of the exterior walls, exclusive of basements, unfinished attics and attached garages. The minimum for a specific residential structure shall be dependent on the number of stories within the residential structure.
i) Total Minimum Living Area (Per unit). The sum of the livable horizontal areas on all levels of a building measured from the interior faces of the exterior walls, exclusive of basements, unfinished attics and attached garages. Each residential dwelling unit shall have separate and individual kitchen and bathroom facilities.

24 | P a g e Unified Development Code  ARTICLE 3  ZONING
j) Minimum Living Area Facade Width. The minimum width required for the front facade of a residential structure, exclusive of garages, porches, decks, or terraces. This requirement may apply to a continuous facade for multi-family or single-family attached units.
k) Maximum Lot Coverage (Structures and Buildings). The maximum amount of enclosed ground floor area of all buildings on a lot expressed as a percentage of the horizontally projected area representing the bulk and mass on the lot.
l) Maximum Lot Coverage (All Impervious Surfaces). The maximum amount of ground floor area occupied by buildings, structures, parking lots, or other impervious surfaces on a lot expressed as a percentage of the horizontally projected area of the lot.
3) Lot Standards Table. Lot Standards are listed in the following tables (Tables 4.4 and 4.5) under each district heading. Additional development standards including but not limited to parking, sign, and landscaping standards are set forth in Chapter VII: Development Standards.

CHAPTER VI: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
Sec. 6.01  PURPOSE
1) This chapter is intended to permit the creation of Planned Unit Development (PUD) Districts in accordance with Georgia Code. PUD districts are intended for a parcel of land planned as a single unit which allows for mixed uses and mixed densities under one zoning classification. This Ordinance allows any zoning district to be rezoned for the creation of a PUD district. PUD Districts create neighborhoods that can benefit from innovations in community development, provide greater efficiency in public utilities and services, and preserve open space. All Planned Unit Developments shall be served by centralized sewer and water.
Sec. 6.02  PUD USES AND STANDARDS
1) USES. All land use classifications that are allowed in this Ordinance may be permitted within a PUD, unless otherwise omitted. All uses are subject to the discretion and approval of the City Council. Once uses are approved by the Council, they are granted by right. All land uses proposed in a Planned Unit Development must be compatible with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan and the characteristics of surrounding land uses and zoning districts.
2) STANDARDS. The development and design standards established in this Ordinance or applicable design guideline documents shall apply unless alternate development or design standards are proposed by the petitioner. The alternate development standards deemed appropriate by the Planning Commission in order to accomplish the intent of the Planned Unit Development shall be specified in the PUD District Ordinance that is certified by the Planning Commission and adopted by the City Council. Any lessening of the required development and design standards of this Ordinance or applicable design guideline documents shall be directly linked to the intent of the Planned Unit Development to:
a) Provide a mixed-use development; or
b) Provide a creative and unique design; or
c) Address unusual physical conditions on site.
Sec. 6.03  PROCEDURE SUMMARY
1) The section establishes procedures for the review, approval and development of a Planned Unit Development District. There are four basic steps in the PUD process which are illustrated in sequence in the flow charts on the following pages and which are described below:
a) Pre-Submittal Conference. The applicant is encouraged to engage in informal consultations with the Villa Rica Community Development staff prior to preparing plans. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss expectations, schedule, concept and standards contained herein. It shall be understood that no statement or representations by a member of either Staff shall be binding upon either the Council or upon any zoning body.
b) PUD District Ordinance and Concept Plan. The PUD District Ordinance and Concept Plan is the second step in the process for establishing a Planned Unit Development. During this step, the
CHAPTER VI  PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
City of Villa Rica, Georgia
__________________________________________________________________________________________
62 | P a g e Unified Development Code  ARTICLE 3  ZONING
petitioners proposed development requirements for the Planned Unit Development are reviewed by the Planning Commission and the City Council. The approved standards are codified in a PUD District Ordinance that has the effect of rezoning the subject property to a Planned Unit Development zoning district, and establishing the development requirements that will be applied in all subsequent reviews. A Concept Plan which accompanies the ordinance provides the Planning Commission and City Council with a general vision for the development of the site.
c) Primary Development Plan. The Detailed Development Plan is the third step in the process. In this step, the applicant prepares an overall plan for the site which will be reviewed by staff, the Technical Advisory Committee and approved by the Planning Commission. For a Planned Unit Development that is going to be subdivided, this step also serves as the Preliminary Plat.
d) Secondary Development Plan. The Secondary Development Plan is the final step in establishing a Planned Unit Development. During this step, the petitioners specific plan for the entire site or a portion of the site is reviewed by the members of the Technical Advisory Committee. For a Planned Unit Development that is going to be subdivided, this step also serves as the Final Plat.
i) Options.
(1) Submission of a Primary Development Plan, processed in the manner described in this Chapter, and the subsequent submission of a Secondary Development Plan for any portion of the approved Primary Development Plan the applicant wishes to develop. The Secondary Development Plan submitted according to this option shall be processed in the manner described in this Chapter.
(2) Submission of a Secondary Development Plan without a Primary Development Plan, processed in the manner described in this Chapter.
Sec. 6.04  PRE-SUBMITTAL CONFERENCE
1) Prior to submitting a Planned Unit Development application, the petitioner shall meet with the Villa Rica Community Development staff to review the zoning classification of the site, review the regulatory ordinances and materials, review the procedures and examine the proposed use and development of the property. Department staff shall aid and advise the applicant in preparing the application and supportive documents as necessary.
Sec. 6.05  PUD DISTRICT ORDINANCE AND CONCEPT PLAN
1) ORIGINATION OF PROPOSALS. Any applicant may propose a Planned Unit Development district in accordance with the procedures established in this chapter. The applicant shall submit an application and fee for a Planned Unit Development in accordance with this section, Section 6.03 Procedure Summary, and the established procedure of the Community Development department. The applicant shall refer to the application packet to determine the format and number of copies of the plans to be delivered.
2) AREA REQUIREMENTS. The minimum land area required for a Planned Unit Development shall be five (5) acres. However, a development of less than five (5) acres may be considered by the Planning Commission for infill projects.

Sec. 7.03  ENTRANCE/DRIVE STANDARDS
1) INTENT. The purpose of these entrance and drive standards is to provide for a safe and efficient vehicular and pedestrian transportation system by establishing minimum standards for site entrance drives, driveways, and interior drives.
2) GENERAL ENTRANCE/DRIVE STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO ALL ZONING DISTRICTS.
a) General Requirements. All driveways and interior drives shall conform to the following design requirements:
i) Entrance Drives and Driveway Widths. Entrance drives shall conform to the following minimum pavement widths up to and at the point which they intersect the public right-of-way. The distances for these standards shall be determined by measuring from the outside edges of the curb or pavement (whichever is more) of the entrance or drive at the public right-of-way which it accesses. The distance shall not include any acceleration or deceleration lanes or turning radii. The width shall be:
(1) Fourteen (14) feet per lane (exclusive of any medians) if from a non-residential or multifamily residential use onto any type of street, and
(2) Twenty-four (24) feet total if from a residential major subdivision onto any type of street.
(3) Twelve (12) feet for an individual residential driveway onto a local street and fourteen (14) feet for one and two-family residential driveways onto arterial or collector streets.
ii) Design and Construction of the Parking Lot Entrance Drive. For every new or converted multi-family, commercial, industrial and quasi-public use, the following standards shall apply:
(1) Length of entrance drive to be kept free of parking maneuvers (backing up, three-point turns, initial parking) shall meet the requirements of Table 7.4a: Parking Lot Drive Length.
(2) Each ingress or egress aisle/driveway shall have a minimum width as identified in Table 7.1a: Parking Dimensions, dependent on the angle of parking. Each aisle/driveway shall be so designed so as to provide for adequate turning and maneuvering. Each ingress or egress aisle/driveway shall be improved with hard, dust free surface materials (excluding gravel) from the street apron to the entrance of the parking area.
(3) There shall be no more than two (2) access ways providing for ingress or egress on any one street unless for good cause shown and approved by the City Engineer.
(4) Ingress and egress driveways shall not be used to meet the requirements of Table 7.3: Minimum Parking Space Requirements as stated in this section and thereby block the reasonable flow of vehicles to parking spaces. Parking arrangements within ingress and egress driveway areas shall be approved by the Planning Commission.
iii) Travel Direction. The direction of travel for vehicles using entrances shall be as follows:
(1) All entrances providing access to a public right-of-way from all lots used for nonresidential or multifamily development shall be designed so that vehicles are traveling in a forward direction when entering and leaving.
(2) In no case may any entrance for any use, except residential uses, be designed to require a vehicle to back onto any arterial or collector street.
iv) Shared Entrances and Drives. Shared entrances and drives are encouraged for all uses in all zoning districts, specifically for any multifamily residential or nonresidential uses accessing a Major Collector or Arterial street.
CHAPTER VII  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
City of Villa Rica, Georgia
_________________________________________________________________________________________
Unified Development Code  ARTICLE 3  ZONING 89 | P a g e
(1) Access Easements. All shared entrances and drives shall be constructed only in appropriate access easements. Easements must be recorded before usage commences.
(2) Required Documentation. A permanent documentation of any shared entrance and drive agreement must be signed by all involved property owners. The permanent written agreement shall include, but is not limited to the following items: maintenance, snow removal, ownership, and liability. The agreement, which can be amended and assigned shall be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer and duly recorded with the County Recorder. Any changes to the agreements must be accomplished with the consent of the Community Development Director. A copy of the agreement shall be retained for the files of the Planning Commission. The agreement shall be recorded prior to the issuance of the occupancy permit.
v) Internal Drives. Internal drives may be public or private streets that are part of the hierarchy of travelways in multifamily and commercial subdivisions, providing access to and connecting the main entrance drive, parking lots and outparcels.
(1) Commercial Area Internal Linkages. All uses located in a commercial zoning district shall provide interior drives that allow access between existing and proposed commercial uses on adjacent properties.
(2) The internal road minimum width shall be twenty (20) feet for multifamily and nonresidential uses and districts.
(3) The interior drives may be required to be curbed, provide pedestrian access and landscaping.
(4) Cross-Access Required. The drives must be designed as a single two-way drive or a pair of one-way drives that provide access between the parking lots and interior drives of all adjoining commercial uses.
(5) Separation. Interior drives providing cross-access between adjacent parcels shall be separated from the right-of-way of any such street by a minimum distance specified by the City Engineer (based on the vehicle stacking requirements of the entrance(s) to the property from the public street).

vi) Curbs. All entrances and interior drives for property used for purposes other than agriculture, single-family residential, or two-family residential shall generally be completely curbed. Curbing shall not be required if, in the opinion of the City Engineer, the drainage system for the property shall be best served if curbs were not present.
vii) Driveway Separations. Driveway locations shall conform to the following minimum requirements for separation:
3) MODIFICATION. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to modify any of the requirements of this section in accordance with Subsection 2.02(1)(q).
Sec. 7.04  SIGHT VISIBILITY
1) Sight Visibility Triangle
a) All properties, with the exception of those located in the Central Business District (CBD), shall maintain an area (the sight visibility triangle) at every intersection of an adjoining street with other streets and entrance drives. The sight visibility triangle shall be free of structures, vegetation, signs (other than street signs), fences, and other opaque or partially opaque objects between a height of two (2) and eight (8) feet measured from the nearest top-of-curb (or edge of pavement where curbs are not present).
b) The Sight Visibility Triangle shall be determined by a diagonal line connecting two points measured twenty-five (25) feet from the intersection of residential or local street / entrance drive lines, and fifty (50) feet from the intersection of arterial or collector street lines, or in the case of a rounded property corner, from the intersection of the street right-of-way lines extended. These standards shall not apply to official warning signs or signals necessary to the public safety.

x) Details shall be shown for the planting of the types of trees, shrubs and ground cover within the buffer yard or landscaped area.
4) APPROVAL.
a) No site or Development Plan required under this Zoning Ordinance shall receive secondary approval unless a buffer yard and landscape plan has been submitted and approved.
b) No final approval of the Land Disturbance Permit shall be granted unless the following criteria are fully satisfied with regard to the approved buffer yard and landscape plan:
i) Such plan has been fully implemented on the site; or
ii) Such plan, because of seasonal conditions, cannot be implemented immediately, but has been guaranteed by a postponed improvement agreement in accordance with Subsection 7.05(5)(h)  Assurance of Installation/Completion.
5) GENERAL LANDSCAPING STANDARDS. Buffer yard and landscape materials shall consist of the following items as indicated below. The proposed landscape materials should complement the form of the existing vegetation, as well as the developments general design and architecture. The cultural conditions (shade, sun, moisture, and location of planted material) should be considered in selecting plant materials.
a) Maintenance of Landscaping and Buffer yards. All landscape materials shall be installed and maintained according to accepted nursery industry procedures.
i) The owner of the property shall be responsible for the continued property maintenance of all landscaping materials and buffer yards, and shall keep them in a proper, neat and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris at all times.
ii) All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced within one (1) year, or by the next planting period, whichever comes first.
iii) Violation of these installation and maintenance provisions shall be grounds for the Community Development department to: fine the owner of the property in violation of the conditions of the Improvement Location Permit; require replacement of the landscape material; or institute legal proceedings to enforce the provisions of this section.
iv) Landscape materials are intended to grow, spread and mature over time. Landscaping materials used to fulfill requirements of this chapter may not be topped or otherwise treated so as to reduce overall height. Pruning, limbing-up, topping, and other inhibiting measures including removal may only be practiced to insure the public safety or to preserve the relative health of the material involved.
b) Buffer yard and Landscaping Establishment. Once the landscape plan has been approved by the Planning Commission or its designee and established by the owner, it may not be used, disturbed or altered in any way that would decrease its effectiveness for any purpose.
c) Earthen Mounds. Earth mounds shall be physical barriers that block or screen the view, similar to a hedge, fence or wall. Mounds shall be constructed using approved fill and with a maximum slope of 3:1 (run:rise) and planted with proper and adequate plant materials to prevent erosion. A difference in elevation between areas requiring screening does not constitute an existing earth mound and shall not be considered as fulfilling any screening requirement.
d) Plant Material. Artificial plants are prohibited. All plant materials shall be living plants and shall meet the following requirements. Plant materials used in conformance with the provisions of
CHAPTER VII  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

If landscaped, it shall be planted with an all-season ground cover and with trees and shrubs in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance and in keeping with the natural surroundings.
f) Preservation of Existing Vegetation. Any existing vegetation that is retained, and that meets the species and location requirements of this section, may be counted towards fulfilling the minimum landscaping requirements, subject to the approval of the Community Development Director. No construction activity of any kind shall take place within the area defined by the drip-line of any vegetation that is to be retained and counted as fulfilling these requirements.
i) Protected Trees. Consistent with the expressed purposes of this subsection, all persons shall make reasonable efforts to preserve and retain any existing, healthy, self-supporting trees, referred to as protected trees. The minimum size of trees to be protected: deciduous trees - six (6) inch caliper; evergreen trees - eight (8) inch caliper; and ornamental trees - two (2) inch caliper. No person shall take out, destroy, cause to be destroyed, move or remove any protected tree in preparation for development activity without first obtaining a Land Disturbance Permit from the Community Development department.
(1) To further encourage the preservation of existing trees, each protected tree that is preserved and is greater than eight (8) inches in caliper may be counted toward the required landscape materials at a rate of two (2) required shade or evergreen trees or four (4) required ornamental trees. Preserved trees may not count toward the caliper inches required for mitigation of any trees removed.
(2) Exemptions. The requirements of this subsection shall be followed except:
(a) During a period of emergency, such as a tornado, ice storm, flood or any other such extreme act of nature;
(b) If the failure to remove a tree would constitute an imminent danger to the environment, property, public health, safety, or welfare due to the hazardous or dangerous condition of such tree;

94 | P a g e Unified Development Code  ARTICLE 3  ZONING
(3) Requirements for Development Plans. All applications for a Land Disturbance Permit or Development Plan Review that will require removal of protected trees shall include a protected tree plan or indicate on the demolition, grading and landscape plans the following:
(a) A scale map or a plot plan showing the proposed development and noting the location of all protected trees. Tree stands may be outlined giving species and category of trees.
(b) Notations regarding which protected trees are to be removed, replaced, or are requested to be counted toward landscaping requirements.
(c) Methods of protection.
g) Measurement Standards. All new trees required to be planted by this Ordinance shall be measured as follows:
i) All broadleaf / deciduous trees shall be two and one-half (2½) inches in diameter (DBH- Diameter at Breast Height) at the time of planting, measured at six (6) inches above the root ball.
ii) All evergreen conifers shall be four (4) feet in height at the time of planting, measured from the top of the root ball.
iii) All shrubs shall be twenty-four (24) inches in height at the time of planting, measured from ground level.
h) Assurance of Installation/Completion. Plant material used for buffer yards, medians, entrances, ponds, or street or subdivision perimeter landscaping shall be designated as Common Area or as a landscape easement on the landscape plan(s), and shall be installed prior to the recording of the plat of the subdivision. A final Certificate of Occupancy shall not be issued until all landscaping shown on the landscape plan has been installed. A temporary Certificate of Occupancy may be issued for the property for a period of up to six (6) months as weather conditions permit landscape installation, provided that the developer shall submit a financial guarantee in the amount of one-hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the installed cost of landscaping when planting has to be delayed.
i) Bonding. The applicant shall also have the option of posting a bond equal to one-hundred fifty percent (150%) of the material and installation costs identified on the plan if the installation of buffer yard and landscaping materials are to be completed at the end of a project. This bond will permit the City to contract the installation of the approved landscape plan, with the applicants landscape contractor, at the required prevailing wage rate should the applicant fail to install the landscape plan within one (1) complete growing season. The Prevailing wage rate is the rate at which the City must pay a contractor to provide services for the City. If the applicant desires bonding, the applicant shall revise the cost annually to account for increases in costs of labor and materials.
j) Utility Easement Conflicts. Required plant material shall be located in areas exclusive of drainage and utility easements and overhead utilities. Plant material shall not be placed in the road/street right-of-way without permission from the City Engineer.

8) STREET TREE PLANTING REQUIREMENT. The following are street tree planting requirements for all districts:
a) Requirements. Trees along public streets shall be planted in such a manner, type, quality and location as approved by the Planning Commission and the same requirement shall apply to all streets with or without undeveloped frontage.
i) One (1) street tree shall be placed every forty (40) to sixty (60) feet outside of the right-of-way per the City Engineer, but within five (5) feet of the edge of the right of way in order to contribute to the streetscape.
ii) The tree location is to be at least twenty (20) feet from fire hydrants or utility poles.
iii) A suitable tree is to be used when planting under or within ten (10) lateral feet of overhead utility wires which will not affect the transmission or service of overhead utility services, subsurface drains, driveways, sidewalks, and underground utilities. Refer to Table 7.12: Trees for Planting on Streets and Highways that Minimize Conflict with Overhead Utilities for suitable trees.
iv) The developers shall be required to maintain the trees for one (1) year after the trees are planted and shall replace any tree which dies within such one (1)-year guarantee period. Upon completion of a street planting, the landscape contractor shall contact the Director or his/her designee for a preliminary inspection. The guarantee period shall begin after the approval by the Planning Director. A final inspection shall be made at the end of the guarantee period. All trees not exhibiting a healthy, vigorous growing condition, as determined by the Citys inspection, shall be promptly replaced at the expense of the developer.
v) Replacement Trees. A person who removes, damages or causes to be removed a public tree from tree lawn or other public place shall be required to replace the tree at his or her own expense. The replacement tree shall be a species from Table 7.11: Trees for Planting on Streets, Highways, and Parking Lots or Table 7.12: Trees for Planting on Streets and Highways that Minimize Conflict with Overhead Utilities.
9) RETENTION POND LANDSCAPING. Shrubs and emergent vegetation are encouraged to be planted on pond perimeters. These plants may be exempt from minimum required plant sizes set forth in Subsection 7.05(5). The use of this plant material is more desirable than nonnative manicured turf in order to provide color, filter runoff, limit waterfowl, and improve water quality.
a) Choose plant material that is native to Georgia.
b) Pond edge seed mixes are available from local suppliers. Pond edge landscaping may also be established from seed.
c) Maintenance shall be consistent as it may take up to three (3) years to mature.
d) Plant denser ground covers around outfall and drainage outlets to control erosion and stabilize the ground.
10) WASTE CONTAINERS/ RECYCLING CONTAINERS / SERVICE STRUCTURES SCREENING REQUIREMENTS. WITH the exception of single-family residential districts, no owner, tenant or occupant of any lot in any district may store, place, or keep, or permit to be stored, placed or kept on that lot, any

combination of dumpsters, compactors, grease dumpsters or any other waste or garbage containers (hereinafter referred to as containers), that exceed a total of one-hundred twenty (120) gallons in capacity, outside an enclosed building, except for collection purposes as is otherwise permitted in this Ordinance, unless the following conditions are met.
a) The containers shall be located on a concrete pad that is enclosed by a three-sided structure constructed of masonry construction or wood sufficient to provide complete visual screening of the containers to a height of twelve (12) inches above the top of the containers. The unit shall be constructed with materials similar to the principal structure. The structures shall not be located closer than twenty (20) feet from any dwelling on an adjacent residential lot. The structure shall not project into or be located on a front or side yard. It may be located in a rear yard but shall be not less than five (5) feet from any rear or side lot lines. On corner lots the enclosure can sit no closer to the street than the building itself.
b) Any service structure that can be seen from the first floor of a residence or from any street shall be screened. Structures may be grouped together; however, screening height requirements shall be based upon the tallest of the structures. Service Structures shall include, but not be limited to: loading docks, propane tanks, dumpsters, electrical transformers, utility vaults which extend above ground, ground-mounted utility equipment and any electrical or other equipment or elements providing service to a building or a site.
i) Location of screening. There shall be a continuous planting, hedge, fence or wall of earth, having one-hundred percent (100%) opacity, which would enclose any service structure on all sides, unless such structures must be frequently moved or accessed, in which case screening on all but one side is required. The average height of the screening material shall be six (6) feet or one (1) foot greater than the height of the enclosed structure, whichever is greater, but shall not, in any case, be required to exceed ten (10) feet in height.
(1) Whenever a service structure is located next to a building wall, perimeter landscaping material, or off-street parking area landscaping material, such walls or screening material may fulfill the screening requirement set out in Subsection 7.05(6). Whenever service structures are screened by plant material, such material may count towards the fulfillment of required interior or perimeter landscaping. Whenever a service structure is screened by a wall or fence, such wall or fence shall be constructed of the same materials as the building which it services.
ii) Curbs to protect screening material. Whenever screening material is placed around any dumpster or waste collection unit which is emptied or removed mechanically on a regularly occurring basis, a curb to contain the placement of the container shall be provided within the screening material on those sides where there is such material. The curbing shall be at least one (1) foot from the material and shall be designed to prevent possible damage to the screening when the container is moved or emptied.
c) If the opening of the unit is in sight of the public right-of-way, it shall be covered by a door constructed of a solid material which shall remain closed when not in use, and it shall be maintained in good condition.
11) MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT BUFFERING STANDARDS. Mechanical equipment materials and buffering standards applicable to the multifamily residential and nonresidential zoning districts:
CHAPTER VII  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
City of Villa Rica, Georgia
_________________________________________________________________________________________
100 | P a g e Unified Development Code  ARTICLE 3  ZONING
a) Ground Level. All outdoor storage areas for completed products manufactured on-site, production materials, building-mounted utilities, outdoor refrigeration units and mechanical equipment located on the ground shall be screened consistent with the following requirements. In no instance shall this be interpreted as applying to merchandise for sale that is temporarily or seasonally placed outdoors.
i) Fencing. A minimum six (6) feet tall, one-hundred percent (100%) opaque fence of wood, brick, or stone construction shall completely screen the area from the view of public streets and adjacent properties. Opaque six (6) feet tall gates shall be provided to access the facility. The gates shall generally remain closed, except when immediate access to the area is required.
ii) Landscape Screening. Evergreen planting shall be provided around the exterior perimeter of the required fencing.
(1) Evergreen shrubs shall be a minimum of two (2) feet tall at the time of planting, and planted at a maximum of three (3) feet on center. Wider spacing may be permitted depending on the species and upon approval of the Director.
b) Roof-mounted. All roof-top equipment, such as HVAC units, shall be screened from the view of all public streets by parapets, dormers, or other screens. The material of all such screens shall be consistent with the exterior materials used on the facade of the structure.
12) BUFFER YARD REQUIREMENTS. The following requirements shall pertain to buffering a new use from an existing adjacent use or district as described below. The purpose of these buffering and screening standards is to lessen the potential conflicts between the possible uses in one zoning district and those uses in adjacent districts through the use of setbacks and landscaping. The potential degree of conflict between the uses determines the extent of the buffer required.
a) Applicability.
i) Screening areas shall be provided for the purpose of minimizing the friction between incompatible land uses and improving the aesthetic and functional quality of new development;
ii) Where vegetative and/or topographic conditions that provide a natural screening and buffer exist prior to development of properties in question, every effort shall be made to retain such conditions. In such cases, additional screening may not be required, provided that provision is made for maintenance of such areas; and
iii) The Planning Commission may waive the requirement for a wall, fence or greenbelt if equivalent screening is provided by existing or planned parks, parkways, and recreation areas or by topography or other natural conditions.
b) Buffer Yard Standards. The buffer yard standards only apply along the property lines where the two dissimilar uses or zoning classifications meet as specified in Table 7.6: Applicable Buffer Yard Types. The required buffer yards shall be installed despite the presence of streets, alleys, and other features. Existing mature vegetation may be credited towards required buffering. When a dissimilar land use locates next to an established residential land use within the same zoning classification, buffering and screening standards per Table 7.7: Buffer Yard Types Description for Buffer Yard Type 2 shall apply.
CHAPTER VII  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
City of Villa Rica, Georgia
_________________________________________________________________________________________
Unified Development Code  ARTICLE 3  ZONING 101 | P a g e
i) Responsibility. The developer or owner of the property being developed or otherwise changed in use is responsible for installing the buffer yard at the time of that development or change. The adjacent property owner shall not have to participate in installing the buffer yard.
ii) Buffer Yard Location. All required buffer yard areas shall be provided entirely on the subject property and shall be in addition to setbacks required by this Ordinance.
iii) Planting Location. Required buffer yard trees may be placed either at regular intervals or in irregular patterns representing a natural landscape. However, no two (2) buffer yard trees (excluding evergreen trees) shall be placed closer than twenty (20) feet to one another. No buffer yard or required landscape materials shall be placed within any easement, right-of-way, or septic field.
iv) Tree Size. All broadleaf / deciduous trees must have at least a two and one-half (2½) inch caliper measured at six (6) inches above the top of the rootball, and all evergreen conifers must be a minimum of four (4) feet in height measured from the top of the rootball when planted.
v) Ground Cover. All portions of the buffer yard not planted with trees, shrubs or other landscaped materials shall be covered with grass or other ground-covering vegetation. Landscaping stone or other non-vegetative surfaces may not be substituted for ground-covering vegetation unless otherwise approved by the Director.
vi) Application. No landscaping required by this section may be used to satisfy the minimum requirements of any other provisions of this Ordinance unless approved by the Director.
vii) Maintenance. All landscape materials must be properly maintained, and kept in a neat and orderly appearance, free from all debris and refuse.
(1) All plant material which is unhealthy or dead, in the opinion of the Community Development Director, shall be replaced by the end of the next spring or fall planting season.
(2) Landscape materials are intended to grow, spread and mature over time. Pruning, limbing-up, topping and other growth-inhibiting measures may only be used to ensure the public safety and/or health of the vegetation.
c) Buffer Yard Widths. The buffer yard requirement shall not be included as part of the minimum setback requirements unless approved by the Director. Plant material shall be selected from Tables 7.11 - 7.18 unless approved by the Director.

Sec. 7.06  TREE CONSERVATION
1) TREE DENSITY REQUIREMENTS
a) Use of tree units. The landscaping requirements of this Article regarding the preservation or
planting of trees is expressed in terms of "tree units" rather than the number of trees or tree
canopy. This approach provides the applicant with wide latitude of choice as to the number and
sizes of trees to be planted, and their distribution following aesthetic landscaping practices, while
achieving a common standard on all properties.
b) Establishment of tree unit values. The diameter of a tree's trunk establishes the "tree unit" value
of an existing tree, as shown on Table 7.9: Unit Value of Landscape Material, or for a newly planted
tree as shown on Table 7.10: Tree Units for Existing Trees.
i) The values assigned to trees of the same size are different for existing and new trees, as
indicated in the table. One "unit" is not the same as one "tree."
ii) Actual tree diameters or calipers are to be rounded to the nearest whole number for the
calculation of tree unit values (e.g., 4.5 inches in diameter = 5 inches).

b) Minimum tree protection measures. Active tree protection shall consist of, at a minimum, establishing a tree protection zone around each tree or grouping of trees by the installation of fencing at the outer edge of the dripline or Critical root zone, whichever is greater. Minimum tree protection measures for boundary trees, existing on adjacent properties, whose critical root zones extend onto the project site is mandatory.
i) No more than twenty-five (25) percent of a boundary tree's mature crown or one-third (1/3rd) of a young tree's canopy shall be removed in one season.
ii) Pruning of conserved trees should only be done by an ISA (International Society of Arboriculture) certified arborist.
iii) Tree protection fencing and tree protection area signs shall be installed after the issuance of a disturbance Permit and prior to any land disturbance activity or building activity.
(1) Tree protection fencing shall be four feet high, made of orange high-visibility polypropylene, and erected with sturdy wooden or metal posts around the tree protection zone. A heritage tree, or a significant species tree, as determined by the Director, may require increased protection. Methods and extent of increased protection will be as directed by the Director.
(2) Signs shall be fabricated out of a sturdy material, shall be waterproof, and contain the following legible text in English and Spanish: "TREE PROTECTION AREA, ENTRY PROHIBITED." The signs shall be a minimum of 8.5 × 11 inches, shall be placed on a sturdy post a minimum of thirty (30) inches off the ground, and shall be spaced a maximum of 50 feet apart.
(3) Tree protection fencing and signage shall remain in good condition throughout the development and construction processes, and shall only be removed after the final plat approval or a certificate of occupancy has been issued.
iv) Encroachment into the tree protection area shall result in the loss of Tree Density Unit credit for preserved trees.

d) Planted trees. All planted trees shall be actively protected during the development process and passively protected throughout the life of the development. The entire tree, including the crown, trunk, and roots, and the critical root zone, shall be protected.
e) Existing trees in construction zones. All trees that are outside the formal tree protection zone(s) as outlined in the Tree Protection and Replacement Plan and are equal to or greater than twelve (12) inches DBH, and are in areas where construction will occur inside the crown of the tree shall be required to have an enhanced protection program. In order to maximize the ability of the selected trees to survive construction the proposed program will include the following steps.
i) The tree will be surveyed and located with the species and DBH noted and approximate crown diameter shown.
ii) Prior to the beginning of construction activities, the trees shall be inspected by a City Approved Arborist to determine their overall condition and ability to withstand construction activity around them.
iii) Should the City Approved Arborist determine that with a proper protection plan the tree would survive the construction activity the Arborist shall prepare a care plan for the tree. The plan may involve elements such as crown pruning, fertilization, irrigation, root pruning or other activities.
iv) The Contractor will be required to implement the Arborist's protection plan and to maintain the necessary activities to protect the tree until such time as the site construction is completed and accepted for maintenance by the property owner.

v) The owner of the property shall receive a 20-percent bonus credit for canopy coverage for all trees that are under the enhanced protection program.
vi) No land disturbing activity or construction activity, including, but not limited to, grading, digging, soil disturbance or other activity within the critical root zone of any boundary tree, is permitted that will deprive the boundary tree of continued viability as determined by a certified arborist.
vii) The following parameters shall be followed when determining boundary tree viability interference:
(1) CRZ/TPZ nineteen (19%) percent or less impact and protected by tree protection, no arboricultural prescription required.
(2) CRZ/TPZ twenty (20%) percent  thirty-three (33%) percent impact but protected by tree protection (no structural root plate impact) provide arboricultural prescription with a plan for review by the city.
(3) CRZ/TPZ twenty (20%) percent  thirty-three (33%) percent impact and structural root plate has impact/not protected.
viii) The builder/developer/construction site property owner must submit a boundary tree agreement signed by the tree owner/co-owner and notarized giving permission for the tree that has construction impact to be treated or removed (see Community Development Department for the city boundary tree agreement). The minimum time length of the boundary tree agreement shall be three (3) years. The receipt for the paid arboricultural prescription and signed agreement will need to be submitted with the plans for review.
(1) The builder/developer/construction site owner must make at least three attempts to contact the owner of the boundary tree to enact a boundary tree agreement. The first two attempts may be in person or via telephone. The third attempt must be in the form of a written letter sent certified, return receipt requested to the property owner's address of record in the Carroll or Douglas County Tax Database. If there is no response to any of the attempts, the builder/developer/construction site owner shall provide evidence to the city of the attempts at contact in addition to the arboriculture prescription for the affected tree.
(2) If no boundary tree agreement is reached, the affected tree shall not be removed but shall be protected during development based on this chapter and in accordance with the arboriculture prescription.
(3) A boundary tree bond or escrow account may be required based on the arboricultural prescription depending on the impact to a boundary tree covered under a boundary tree agreement.
(4) A boundary tree bond or escrow account shall be required where a boundary tree agreement cannot be reached.
(5) A boundary tree bond or escrow shall be one-hundred and twenty-five (125%) percent of the cost of removal and replacement of the tree(s) affected and will be held for three years by the city. The property owner of the affected tree(s) may apply to the city for the escrow funds to remove and replace the tree(s) during the three-year escrow period. If the boundary tree(s) is/are deemed healthy at the end of the three-year period by an Arborist, the developer may apply to the City for a refund of the original amount of escrow.
CHAPTER VII  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
City of Villa Rica, Georgia
_________________________________________________________________________________________
Unified Development Code  ARTICLE 3  ZONING 109 | P a g e
(6) The site/landscape plans cannot be approved without signed boundary tree agreement(s) or proof of attempts to contact the boundary tree owner in an attempt to reach a boundary tree agreement in addition to an arboriculture prescription where needed.
7) SEASONAL PLANTING.
Final plat approval or a certificate of occupancy may be issued prior to the establishment of trees planned to meet the tree canopy cover requirements, if the Community Development Director or their designee determines that the season is inappropriate for planting. In such cases the trees shall be planted by the last day of February following the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy or final plat approval. If they have not been planted by the last day of February following the issuance of the certificate of occupancy or final plat approval, the permit holder shall be considered to be in violation of the provisions of this article.
8) TREE BANK
The intent of the requirements of this Section is to ensure that a minimum number of trees are replaced and/ or preserved on newly developed or redeveloped sites. The Tree Bank is an alternative option and may be used only in the event the site tree density or recompense tree requirement cannot be met on-site due to hardship. Hardship must be documented by the developer and presented to the Director before the Tree Bank may be used. The Tree Bank provides two options, which are described in full below.
a) Option One, Planting Trees Off-site.
i) Install an equal amount of required Tree Density Units in the form of an approved number of trees on an alternate site. In this case the following criteria shall be observed:
ii) The technical Advisory Committee has identified alternate "Option One" sites. The Villa Rica Community Development Department has contacted the owners of these sites and these owners have expressed an interest in receiving trees from the Tree Bank. Persons wishing to use Option One should consult with the Zoning Administrator to see if their required tree density units can be located on one of these alternate sites. The developer may present the Zoning Administrator with alternate sites. Planting on individual residential lots is prohibited.
iii) The developer shall submit a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan showing a location for the planted trees on the proposed site. The developer shall also provide calculations on the plan for tree density or recompense trees from the developed site. The site plan shall state the size, genus, species, and quantity of trees to be planted. Each tree must be two (2) caliper inches at a minimum. For trees in which double recompense is required each tree must be three (3) caliper inches at a minimum. Recompense calculations must be shown on plan.
iv) If the proposed site is not one of the alternate sites, discussed above, an authorization from the title holder of the site indicating that the owner agrees to the planting of trees by the developer upon the site shall also be submitted along with the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan.
v) Trees are to be maintained and guaranteed for one full year after planting by the developer. Any trees that die during the one-year time period must be replaced by the developer. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established by the International Society of Arboriculture, as included in the "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual," latest edition.
CHAPTER VII  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
City of Villa Rica, Georgia
_________________________________________________________________________________________
110 | P a g e Unified Development Code  ARTICLE 3  ZONING
b) Option Two, Monetary Compensation for Trees.
i) A developer may choose to provide the City with monetary compensation for trees. If this alternative for the development is chosen, then the following criteria shall be observed:
ii) Provide tree density calculations on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Show the total amount of Tree Density Units that cannot be met on-site.
iii) Multiply the Tree Density Units that cannot be met on-site by the Monetary Compensation Value. The product of those two numbers shall be provided on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Contact City approved certified arborist or landscape architect for the current Monetary Compensation Value.
iv) Provide a certified check made payable to the City of Villa Rica in the amount of the product as listed in item ii. above and as provided on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Submit the certified check to a Community Development Director or designee along with a copy of the approved Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan.
v) The monies collected for the Tree Bank Option Two may be used by the City for the planting of trees at parks, greenways, fire stations, libraries, and other similar community facilities. Alternate planting locations may be approved by the Director.
c) Standards for Administering these Alternative Compliance Methods.
i) The Director must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall the alternative compliance options be used to comply with any other ordinance requirement than the tree density or specimen tree requirement. The site development permit shall be issued after the Director has approved the request for either compliance option and received the necessary documentation and funds.
d) Exclusions.
i) Trees used to meet requirements for parking lots, landscape strips, street frontage buffers, or buffer replanting must be planted on site and are excluded from the Tree Bank procedures. Trees that are required to meet minimum Tree Density Units and/or recompense requirements can be contributed toward the Tree Bank in accordance with Option One or Option Two above.
Sec. 7.07  REDEVELOPMENT SITES
1) For redeveloped sites the Department of Planning and Development strongly recommends the developer, authorized registered professionals, design professionals and staff schedule a pre-submittal meeting with the department to discuss the potential of the site and any issues that may be present on the site.
2) Redeveloped sites shall comply with the buffer and specimen tree requirements as set forth in this ordinance and provide compliance with parking lot, landscape strip and Tree Density Unit requirements.
3) Where the scope of a project results in disturbance, removal, and replacement of twenty-five percent (<25%) percent or greater of the site area, a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan is required. The plan shall include the existing and proposed landscape conditions that verify compliance with this ordinance.
CHAPTER VII  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
City of Villa Rica, Georgia
