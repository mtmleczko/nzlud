PREFACE 
    This Code is a codification of the ordinances of City of Parkland, Florida, of a general and permanent nature. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
    This 2012 republication includes all amendatory legislation through Ord. No. 2012-03, adopted May 2, 2012, and was accomplished under the supervision of Beth Tattershall, Editor. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the third section of chapter 5 is 5-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 6-3 and 6-4 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 6-3.1, 6-3.2 and 6-3.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 9 and 10 it will be designated as chapter 9.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Alyce A. Whitson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Robert E. Huebner, City Attorney, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code.

    For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words, and their derivations shall have the meaning given herein.

(Ord. No. 2008-31, § 2(2-29), 11-5-2008)

(Ord. No. 2008-31, § 2(2-30), 11-5-2008) 
Sec. 2-52.2. - Code enforcement special magistrate jurisdiction and authority. 
(a)  The code enforcement special magistrate ("special magistrate") shall have the jurisdiction and authority to hear and decide alleged violations of the following: 
(1)  The city zoning ordinances, the land development code as it exists today and as may be amended from time to time, and all ordinances relating to the development, maintenance, use, construction or condition of real property, building or structures within the city. 
(2)  All city building codes, including, but not limited to, the Florida Building Code. 
(3)  All city fire codes and any other city ordinances to the extent permitted by law.

(Ord. No. 2008-31, § 2(2-31), 11-5-2008) 
Sec. 2-52.3. - Enforcement procedure. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), if a violation of the codes is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator and give him or her a reasonable time to correct the violation. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the code inspector shall schedule a hearing. The code inspector, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing, and written notice of such hearing shall be hand delivered or mailed as provided in Section 162.12, Florida Statutes, to said violator. At the option of the code inspector, notice may additionally be served by publication or posting as provided in Florida Statutes Section 162.12. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code inspector, the case may be presented to the special master even if the violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(b)  If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code inspector, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall request a hearing before the special magistrate. The special magistrate, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing and shall provide notice pursuant to Florida Statutes Section 162.12. The case may be presented to the special magistrate even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice shall so state. If the repeat violation has been corrected, the special master retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose to waive his or her rights to this hearing and pay said costs as determined by the special magistrate. 
(c)  If the code inspector has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately notify the special magistrate and request a hearing. 
(d)  If the owner of property that is subject to an enforcement proceeding before a special master transfers ownership of such property between the time the initial pleading was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
(4)  File a notice with the code enforcement official of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five (5) days after the date of the transfer. 
A failure to make the disclosures described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) before the transfer creates a rebuttal presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(Ord. No. 2008-31, § 2(2-31), 11-5-2008) 
Sec. 2-52.4. - Conduct of hearing. 
(a)  Upon request of the code inspector, or at such other times as may be necessary, the special master shall schedule a hearing. Minutes shall be kept of all hearings and all hearings and proceedings shall be open to the public. The local governing body shall provide clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably required by the special magistrate. 
(b)  Each case before the special magistrate shall be presented by the local governing body attorney or by a member of the administrative staff of the local governing body. If the local governing body prevails in prosecuting a case before the special magistrate, it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case before the special magistrate and such costs may be included in the lien authorized under Section 162.09(3), Florida Statutes. 
(c)  A special magistrate shall proceed to hear the cases on the agenda for that day. All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The special magistrate shall take testimony from the code inspector and alleged violator. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings. 
(d)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the special magistrate shall issue findings of fact, based on evidence of record and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with powers granted herein. The order may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that a fine may be imposed and, under the conditions specified in Section 162.09(1), Florida Statutes, the cost of repairs may be included along with the fine if the order is not complied with by said date. A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the special magistrate shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that it shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance. 
(Ord. No. 2008-31, § 2(2-33), 11-5-2008) 
Sec. 2-52.5. - Powers of special magistrates. 
    The special magistrate shall have the power to: 
(1)  Adopt rules for the conduct of its hearings. 
(2)  Subpoena alleged violators and witnesses to its hearings. Subpoenas may be served by the sheriff of the county or police department of the municipality. 
(3)  Subpoena evidence to its hearings. 
(4)  Take testimony under oath. 
(5)  Issue orders having the force of law to command whatever steps are necessary to bring a violation into compliance. 
(6)  To exercise all authority as granted to special magistrates in Section 162.03(2), Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2008-31, § 2(2-34), 11-5-2008) 
Sec. 2-52.6. - Administrative fines; costs of repair; liens. 
(a)  A special magistrate, upon notification by the code inspector that an order of the special magistrate has not been complied with by the set time or upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the special magistrate for compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in Florida Statutes Section 162.06(4), the special magistrate shall notify the local governing body, which may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the local governing body to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the local governing body for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this part, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. If, after due notice and hearing, the special magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in subsection (b)(1). 
(b)  (1)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for a first violation and shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for a repeat violation, and in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to subsection (a). However, if the special magistrate finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per violation. A special magistrate may impose additional fines to cover costs incurred by the city in enforcing its codes and the costs of all repairs undertaken. 
(2)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the special magistrate shall consider the following factors: 
a.  The gravity of the violation; 
b.  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
c.  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(c)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a fine plus repair costs, may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order shall be enforceable in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including execution and levy against the personal property of the violator, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this part shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the local governing body, and the local governing body may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section. After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the enforcement board may authorize the local governing body attorney to foreclose on the lien or to sue to recover a money judgment for the amount of the lien plus accrued interest. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this part may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under § 4, Art. X of the State Constitution. The money judgment provisions of this section shall not apply to real property or personal property which is covered under § (4)(a), Art. X of the State Constitution. A code enforcement lien shall have priority over all liens except those for ad valorem taxes.

(Ord. No. 2008-31, § 2(2-37), 11-5-2008) 
Sec. 2-52.9. - Mitigation of code liens. 
(a)  Any respondent, against whom a fine or lien has been imposed pursuant to section 2-52.6, and who has cured the violation as determined by the city, may petition in writing (in a form determined by the city) the code enforcement special master for mitigation of the fine/lien. Any mitigation request shall be filed with the city clerk who shall forward it to the special master. The city clerk shall schedule the matter for hearing as the earliest possible special master meeting. Any request shall contain the circumstances which the applicant believes justifies the mitigation of the lien and shall address the factors for mitigation as forth below. The city commission shall set a fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) to file any request; said fee shall be paid at the time of the request. 
(b)  In making a determination with regard to an application for mitigation of a fine/lien, the code enforcement special master shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The length of time that has elapsed since a violation was determined to exist on the property by the special master; and 
(2)  The length of time the violation existed passed the time for compliance; and 
(3)  The difficulty in remedying the condition which led to the code enforcement violation; and 
(4)  Whether the violation was a repeat offense; and 
(5)  The severity of the code violation and its impact upon the public health, safety and welfare and the negative effects on the aesthetics of the city or the neighboring community; and 
(6)  Costs incurred by the city in prosecuting or otherwise responding to the code violation case; and 
(7)  The costs incurred by the applicant in remedying the violation and the quality of remedy affected; and 
(8)  The number of existing or previous code violations found or notice of code violations issued for the property in the past five (5) years; and 
(9)  Such other equitable and/or legal considerations as the committee may find are appropriate. 
(c)  The special master shall not consider the impact of the mitigation request on the prospective sale of the property. 
(d)  The code enforcement special master shall hold a hearing on the mitigation request at which the applicant may present witnesses in his/her favor and the city may present witnesses which it believes are relevant to the request. Further, members of the public may speak on the request. Only evidence germane to the request and the standards set forth above shall be considered by the special master in making his/her determination. 
(e)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the special master shall render its decision and the application in writing.

Sec. 2-61. - Travel policy. 
    The provisions of this section are intended to be in partial substitution of the provisions of F.S. Section 112.061 or any successor to such statute. 
(a)  Payment of expenses; exceptions to state statute. The city will pay the reasonable travel expenses of the city commission members, officers, and employees incurred in connection with authorized city travel. It is the intent of the city commission to follow F.S. Section 112.061, with the following exceptions: Relating to subsection (6) Rates of Per Diem and Subsistence Allowance, (a)(1) through (b) and (d) are hereby modified to the following: 
(1)  Breakfast   $ 6.00 
(2)  Lunch      $ 8.00 
(3)  Dinner     $14.00 
(4)  Lodging shall be based upon the group rate as indicated in conference brochure, if applicable; or, based on actual costs for lodging at a single-occupancy rate which is substantiated by paid bills therefor. 
(5)  With respect to mileage allowance for the use of the privately owned vehicles, the allowance shall be based upon the existing rate established by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 
Alternative: A traveler on official city business which requires overnight lodging may request a per diem payment of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for lodging and meals in lieu of submitting receipts for such lodging and meals. The traveler shall be reimbursed one-fourth (1/4) of the authorized per diem rate of the travel day pursuant to F.S. Section 112.061, subsection 5(a). 
(b)  Advance travel authorization and advancement of funds. Persons shall obtain authorization for city travel, and, if needed, an advance of funds for use on the trip, by completing a travel estimate of expenses form and obtaining approval by the department director, the finance department with respect to availability of funds, and the city manager. The travel forms are available in the finance department. 
No advancement of funds shall be made for persons who are accompanying an authorized travel but who are not on official city business themselves. If, as a matter of convenience, the authorized traveler wishes the city to make travel arrangements for such persons, all costs of the travel arrangements shall be paid to the city before the city proceeds with such arrangements. 
(c)  Filing of travel expense and settlements forms. At the conclusion of the trip, the traveler must submit a travel expense and settlement form to the city manager. This settlement shall be accompanied by receipts and other documents in support of expenses set forth thereon. Regardless of whether or not an advance was received, this travel expense and settlement form shall be filed within forty (40) days of the traveler's return. If the travel expense and settlement form is not filed within forty (40) days, the city shall not reimburse expenses and, in the case of an undocumented advancement, shall have the right to deduct the amount of such undocumented advancement from future compensation payments. Any difference between the amount advanced and the reasonable expenses shall either be returned to the city or reimbursed to the traveler, whichever is appropriate. 
(d)  Proof of expenses. The city administration shall require proof that expenditures were actually incurred and for the authorized public purpose. All expenditures shall be substantiated by receipts and/or other supporting documentation. If adequate proof relating to any one (1) or all of the categories is not submitted, reimbursement shall not be made. The travel expense and settlement forms are to be approved by the department director, subjected to an audit by the finance department, and submitted by the city manager for review and approval. The city manager shall approve all city travel by officials and employees, except for the city commissioners, in advance. However, the city manager shall keep the commission advised of the status of the commission travel budget and year-to-date expenditures. The city commission shall approve any travel expenditures which exceed budgeted amounts.

(f)  City responsibility for debris removal from private rights-of-way. If the property owner has executed an agreement with the city in accordance with section 2-101(g) of the City Code granting the city access to private property for debris removal purposes, the city shall be responsible for the removal of disaster-generated debris from private rights-of-way adjacent to residential property when the disaster-generated debris is determined by the city manager, in the city manager's sole discretion in accordance with this section, (i) to pose an immediate threat to the health, safety and welfare of the public in the area, (ii) to pose an immediate threat of significant damage to surrounding improved property within the city, or (iii) to require removal to provide an economic benefit to the community as a whole. 
    In order to determine that there is such an immediate threat or circumstance sufficient to warrant removal of disaster-generated debris from private rights-of-way adjacent to residential property within the city, the city manager shall first consider the factors in this subsection and make a written finding as to whether the presence and/or imminent development of any of the dangers or aggravating factors below exists: 
(1)  There is a significant likelihood that rescue vehicles will be significantly hindered from rendering emergency services to property should the debris be allowed to remain in place absent city removal; or 
(2)  The type of disaster-generated debris is such that it may reasonably cause disease, illness, or sickness which could injure or adversely affect the health, safety, or general welfare of those residing and working in the area if it is allowed to remain; or 
(3)  The clearing is necessary to effectuate orderly and expeditious restoration of citywide utility services including, but not limited to, power, water, sewer, and telephone; or 
(4)  The disaster-generated debris is determined to be dangerous or hazardous to persons or property; or 
(5)  The disaster-generated debris prevents garbage collection thereby creating a public health hazard; or 
(6)  The disaster-generated debris contains contaminants which have a reasonable likelihood of leaching into the soil and/or aquifer of the city; or 
(7)  The disaster-generated debris has a substantial negative impact in preventing or adversely affecting emergency repairs to buildings and/or property; or 
(8)  The disaster-generated debris presents a reasonable danger of being transported by wind and/or water into the surrounding areas of the city and thereby increasing the cost of recovery and removal; or 
(9)  The disaster-generated debris poses a significant likelihood of producing mold which would be injurious to public health; or 
(10)  The presence of the disaster-generated debris significantly adversely impacts the city's recovery efforts; or

(Ord. No. 2017-04, § 2, 5-17-2017) 
Sec. 2-142.3. - Ethics in procurement. 
(1)  Any attempt by city employees to realize personal gain by conduct inconsistent with proper discharge of their duties is a breach of public trust. Any effort to influence any public employee to breach the standards of ethical conduct set forth in this division is also a breach of ethical standards. The provisions of city ordinances, county ordinances, and state statutes shall be strictly enforced to preserve the public trust. 
(2)  The city shall not execute a contract if there has been a violation of this section, any ethics provision of a procurement solicitation, or any local, state, or federal law, including, but not limited to: 
(a)  Conflicts of interest: 
(b)  Kickbacks:

An unauthorized purchase occurs when any employee of the city orders, contracts for or buys any services, materials or supplies outside the purview of the City Charter and/or this Code. Any individual making an unauthorized purchase may be subject to disciplinary actions as appropriate, which may include termination and/or prosecution. The following are unauthorized purchasing practices: 
(a)  Artificially dividing purchases into multiple segments in an attempt to issue single orders below the dollar threshold requirements as established herein (also known as "stringing" or "slitting purchase orders") is prohibited. 
(b)  Purchasing any supplies or services above the thresholds delineated herein directly from a vendor, bypassing the purchasing and contracts and administration division. 
(c)  Committing to a purchase without issuance of an authorized purchase order, when one is required. 
(d)  Obtaining items available on an existing city term contract from a supplier that does not hold the contract. 
(e)  Providing false information such as false quotations ("without actually contacting and obtaining a quotation, bid or proposal from a vendor). 
{f}  Adding unauthorized purchases to previously approved purchase orders without approval of the appropriate approval authority and subsequent modification of the purchase order. 
(Ord. No. 2017-04, § 3, 5-17-2017) 
Sec. 2-142.4. - Criminal background checks. 
(1)  Except as otherwise set forth in law, for any contracts which require a contractor, subcontractor, consultant or sub-consultant to perform work in or on city property where the contractor or any subcontractors or employees will perform work or services in close proximity to facilities with minors, the elderly or persons with special needs or where the services are of a nature which would reasonably warrant background checks, the city shall include a requirement for a criminal background check for any person employed by or under contract with the contractor, subcontractor, consultant or sub-consultant who is doing the work in or on city property. 
(2)  Contractors and consultants shall, at their expense, obtain a criminal background check, as defined in subsection (1) above, for each person employed by or under contract with the contractor, subcontractor, consultant or sub-consultant having access to city property where the contractor or any subcontractors or employees will perform work or services in close proximity to facilities with minors, the elderly or persons with special needs or where the services are of a nature which would reasonably warrant background checks, prior to beginning the work. 
(3)  All criminal background checks must be conducted prior to any covered individual's initial access to city's property and, depending on the contract's term, on an annual basis thereafter. The contractor or consultant shall be required to submit an affidavit on the form included with the bid documents, the request for proposal or the request for qualifications certifying that background checks have been completed for all employees as set forth in subsection (2) above and certify that no employee who has been convicted or who has entered a plea of nolo contendere for any crime set forth within subsection (4) below shall perform work on city property where the contractor or any subcontractors or employees will perform work or services in close proximity to facilities with minors, the elderly or persons with special needs or where the services are of a nature which would reasonably warrant background checks. Such affidavit shall be submitted to the contract administrator prior to any work being performed. Contractor or consultant shall maintain records of the criminal history checks for each person doing work on city property during the contract period and for one (1) year thereafter and shall make such records available for inspection and verification by city. 
(4)  If such a check reveals a conviction or a plea of nolo contendere, regardless of when the plea or conviction occurred, which includes a felony or misdemeanor involving terrorist behavior, violence, use of a dangerous weapon, crimes of moral turpitude or breach of trust/fiduciary responsibility or which raises concerns about building, system, or personal security or is otherwise a job-related crime, the contractor or consultant shall not assign the individual to any work in or on city property. If such a check reveals any of the foregoing after access has already been granted, any access privileges already granted shall be immediately revoked and shall not be reinstated without the city's express written authorization. In the event that the contractor or consultant intends to hire new personnel to perform the required services, the background checks should be initiated at the time of the hire. 
(5)  The city reserves the right to approve or disapprove whether a contractor's or consultant's employees perform the services for the city. Disapproval would apply solely to the contract at issue and would have no bearing on the contractor's or consultant's employment of an individual outside of the contract. 
(6}  The city may conduct its own independent background checks and bar any covered individual from accessing the city's property in its complete discretion. The contractor's or consultant's failure to comply with the terms of this provision shall be considered a material breach rendering the contractor or consultant in default and allowing immediate termination by the city. 
(7)  At the discretion of the city manager, this section shall not be applicable during a declared emergency situation, including, but not limited to, emergency cleanup of debris following a major storm. 
(8)  To the extent that work is being done on city property, the criminal background check procedure shall apply to a competitive solicitation process for contractors or consultants who seek to enter into a contract or award of money to perform governmental, quasi-governmental, social, or human services primarily for charitable, benevolent, humanitarian, or other philanthropic purposes, such as the award of grants or support assistance to organized nonprofit entities that promote or assist with the care, education, health, standard of living, or general welfare of people in the City of Parkland, or that promote or assist community or neighborhood enhancements. 
(Ord. No. 2017-04, § 4, 5-17-2017) 
Sec. 2-143. - Procedures. 
Sec. 2-143.1. - Bid specifications. 
(1)  The preparation of specifications is the responsibility of the user department. Specifications are important and are intended to promote competition among vendors. Specifications should be written in terms which define the performance required or the design of the goods/services, rather than using specific brand names; provided that where there is a requirement for a specific brand, such brand may be specified if the department head places a memorandum on file justifying the need for a specific brand. Specifications should be clear and concise, and they should provide complete and detailed descriptions of the item(s) and/or services(s) being solicited, including quantity of items or dates of contractual services. 
(2)  If the goods or services desired is outside the expertise of the department personnel and specifications cannot be prepared by the department, the department head may contact prospective bidders with a written request for information (RFI) and request recommended solutions to provide city staff with an adequate understanding to prepare the specifications. Prospective bidders and city personnel are not permitted to discuss pricing during this process. 
(3)  In addition to the specifications, the bid package must contain the specific instructions and information to potential bidders. The bid package must: 
(a)  State the time, date and place where bids will be received. 
(b)  State statement of work, instructions for preparing proposals and evaluation criteria to determine the best bidder. 
(c)  Provide standard bid language to address Public Entity Crimes Act; compliance with laws; drug free work place; and DBE participation. 
(4)  The bid/proposal package may contain such requirements as deemed appropriate and is at the sole discretion of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2007-22, § 1(exh. A), 12-5-2007; Ord. No. 2009-22, § 2, 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 2012-07, § 1, 4-18-2012; Ord. No. 2018-001, § 1(exh. A), 3-7-2018) 
Sec. 2-143.2. - Bonding. 
(1)  Bid bond. The purpose of a bid bond is to protect the city against the failure or refusal of the low bidder to supply the necessary performance and payment bonds, as required, to proceed with performance under the contract. Bid bond requirements shall be at the discretion of the department head; however, all construction bids over one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) must have a bid bond. 
(a)  A bid bond shall be provided by the bidder at the time of the bid, and is submitted with the bid. 
(b)  The amount of the bid bond is generally expressed as a percentage of the total amount of the bid. Typically, this is five (5) percent unless otherwise stated in the solicitation to bid. 
(c)  If a contractor fails to submit a bid bond with their bid, the bid will be rejected. 
(d)  The city reserves the right to accept a certified check in lieu of a bid bond. 
(2)  Performance bond, payment bond and warranty bond. 
(a)  The purpose of bonds is to protect the city against any losses resulting from the contractor's failure to meet the plans and/or specifications, providing labor and materials and faulty workmanship or defective materials of a contract. 
(b)  Payment and performance bonds shall be required for projects in excess of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) or as otherwise provided by law. 
(Ord. No. 2007-22, § 1(exh. A), 12-5-2007; Ord. No. 2009-22, § 3, 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 2012-07, § 1, 4-18-2012; Ord. No. 2018-001, § 1(exh. A), 3-7-2018) 
Sec. 2-143.3. - Competitive bid. 
    The department head or his/her designee shall verify that funds have been appropriated, and are available. Upon verification, the purchasing director or designee shall forward the request to the city clerk for the appropriate notice to be posted or advertised in a newspaper of general circulation or the appropriate trade journal as determined necessary by the purchasing director or designee or as required by applicable law. All advertisements shall provide a reasonable time of not less than fourteen (14) days for potential bidders to respond unless the department head certifies a need for purchase in a more expeditious manner, in which case the fourteen-day period may be reduced to seven (7) days. Nothing herein shall prevent the purchasing director or designee or affected department head from directly sending an invitation to bid to known potential bidders. However, city officers and employees shall not disclose or use any information not available to the public for personal benefit of themselves or others (F.S. § 112.313(8)). 
(Ord. No. 2007-22, § 1(exh. A), 12-5-2007; Ord. No. 2012-07, § 1, 4-18-2012; Ord. No. 2018-001, § 1(exh. A), 3-7-2018) 
Sec. 2-143.4. - Competitive bid opening. 
    Bid openings shall be conducted in public by the purchasing director or designee, at the time and place stated in the advertisement. No bids will be accepted after the time and date designated. Bid addenda may be issued by the city up until twenty-four (24) hours before bid opening or in accordance the competitive bid specifications. Bids received after the time and date designated should be returned unopened. This provision is not waivable. A tabulation of all bids and any accompanying bid materials submitted shall be made available to the public by the purchasing director or designee. 
(Ord. No. 2007-22, § 1(exh. A), 12-5-2007; Ord. No. 2012-07, § 1, 4-18-2012; Ord. No. 2018-001, § 1(exh. A), 3-7-2018) 
Sec. 2-143.5. - Award of competitive bid. 
(1)  Bids shall be awarded by the city commission to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder able to meet the requirements of the bid specifications. In determining the lowest responsive and most responsible bidder, in addition to the price, the following may be considered: 
(a)  The ability, capacity, and skill of the bidder to perform the contract. 
(b)  Whether the bidder can perform the contract within the time specified, without delay or interference. 
(c)  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the bidder. 
(d)  The quality of performance on previous public or private contracts of a similar type. 
(e)  The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and ordinances relating to the contract. 
(f)  The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service. 
(g)  Tie bids. The tie may be broken and the successful vendor selected by the following criteria presented in order of importance and consideration: 
1.  Quality of the items or services if it is ascertainable. 
2.  Time of delivery if provided in the bid. 
3.  If the criteria in subsections (g)1. and 2. of this section are impossible to determine with any reasonableness or do not resolve the issue, the award will be given to that vendor whose bid was received first as indicated by the time stamp on the envelope containing the bid. 
(2)  Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this policy. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which may include additional criteria to determine suitability for a particular purpose. 
(3)  Except where prohibited by federal, state or city law, for bid solicitations where the bid is to be awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder without a numerical grading, the city may grant a preference in the amount of five (5) percent of any bid to the lowest responsive and responsible local bidder. If said local bidder is within five (5) percent of the lowest responsive and responsible bid, then the lowest responsive, responsible local bidder shall be permitted to match the lowest bid within three (3) business days of notice from the city. For all other competitive solicitations in which evaluation factors are used to numerically evaluate the responses from vendors by the selection committee, and price is one of several criteria for award among otherwise qualified vendors, where a non-local business is the highest ranked proposer and the ranking of a local proposer is within five (5) percent of the ranking obtained by the non-local proposer, the highest ranked local proposer (within five (5) percent) shall have the opportunity to proceed to negotiations with the city upon approval of such ranking by the city commission (or staff if the award does not need commission approval). If the purchasing director or designee is unable to negotiate a contract deemed to be acceptable with the highest ranked local proposer (within five (5) percent), the purchasing director or designee shall report to the city commission which shall either require that the purchasing director or designee continue negotiations or authorize negotiations with the second-ranked firm, whether local or non-local, until the process is complete or, until the purchasing director or designee or the city commission determines that it is no longer feasible to continue negotiating; at any time the city commission has the full discretion to either abandon the process or begin the process again. 
(4)  This section shall not apply to professional services procured pursuant to the State of Florida Consultants Competitive Negotiations Act, nor to cooperative purchasing plans and proposals that the city participates in with other governmental agencies or "piggyback" bid purchases. To qualify as a local vendor/bidder/proposer/supplier, an eligible bidder or proposer must satisfy the criteria set forth in subsections (4)(a) to (c) below. The city has sole discretion in determining whether a business meets the criteria to qualify for a local business preference and reserves the right to revoke this preference at any time if the city determines the business no longer meets the following criteria: 
(a)  Its principal place of business is located in the city; 
(b)  The business has held a valid city business license for at least one (1) year prior to the date of application; and 
(c)  It maintains its status as a local bidder throughout the term of the contract; if it fails to do so, the contract shall entitle the city, in its sole discretion, to terminate the contract. 
(Ord. No. 2007-22, § 1(exh. A), 12-5-2007; Ord. No. 2009-22, § 4, 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 2011-12, § 2, 5-18-2011; Ord. No. 2012-07, § 1, 4-18-2012; Ord. No. 2018-001, § 1(exh. A), 3-7-2018) 
Sec. 2-143.6. - Correction, cancellation, or withdrawal of bids. 
(1)  Correction on bids. 
(a)  Mathematical errors. Errors in extension of unit prices or mathematical calculations may be corrected by the purchasing director or designee prior to award. The unit prices shall not be changed. 
(b)  [Non-judgemental mistakes.] A bidder shall be permitted to correct clerical, non-judgmental mistakes of fact in their bid. 
(c)  Voluntary reduction of price. The city may accept a voluntary reduction from a low bidder after bid opening, if such reduction is not conditioned on, nor results in, the modification or deletion of any condition contained in the invitation for bids. A voluntary reduction may not be used to ascertain the lowest responsive bidder. 
(2)  Cancellation of bids. 
(a)  Any time prior to bid opening date and time, the city may cancel or postpone the bid opening or cancel the invitation for bid in its entirety. 
(b)  After bids are open, any or all bids may be rejected by the city. 
(3)  Withdrawal of bids. 
(a)  Any bidder may voluntarily withdraw or amend his/her bid at any time prior to the bid opening by providing written notice to the city. Amendments should be forwarded to the purchasing director or designee, sealed and identified. 
(b)  After bid opening, vendors shall not be allowed to withdraw a bid in less than ninety (90) days, or a specific time period stated in the invitation to bid with the following exception: The bid is so outrageous as to be a prima facie evidence of a bid mistake, but a mistake that cannot be corrected by correction of mathematical computation. 
(Ord. No. 2007-22, § 1(exh. A), 12-5-2007; Ord. No. 2012-07, § 1, 4-18-2012; Ord. No. 2018-001, § 1(exh. A), 3-7-2018)

(2)  Non-collusive affidavit. Proposers shall complete the non-collusive form and shall submit the form with the proposal. The failure to submit this document could result in the rejection of the proposal. 
(3)  Compliance with laws. The selected firm, its officers, agents, employees, and contractors, shall abide by and comply with all federal, state, and local laws. It is agreed and understood that if city calls the attention of the contractor to any such violations on the part of the contractor, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, then the contractor shall immediately desist from and correct such violation. If the contractor is in violation of any law, the contractor shall be solely responsible for coming into compliance with such law and shall be solely responsible for the payment of any fine charged for such violation. 
(4)  Drug-free workplace (DFW). In accordance with F.S. § 287.087, preference shall be given to businesses with drug-free workplace programs. Whenever two (2) or more proposals which are equal with respect to price, quality, and service are received by the city for the procurement of commodities or contractual services, a proposal received from a business that completes the attached DFW form certifying that it is a DFW shall be given preference in the award process. 
(5)  Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE) participation. Offerors are advised that the city promotes equal employment opportunity (EEO) and encourages the participation of minority and women business enterprises (M/WBE) as well as small business enterprises (SBE) in all aspects of contracting. Joint venturing at the prime and sub-consultant levels is encouraged where the joint venture results in a more qualified and/or more diverse proposer. Proposers shall make efforts to maintain no less than fifteen (15) percent DBE participation for contracts over one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00). The city will accept certifications from offerors, including their subcontractors identified in their response, as defined and certified by the Florida Department of Management, Office of Supplier Diversity or other certifying organizations or jurisdictions in accordance with F.S. § 287.0943(1) and (2). 
(6)  [Multiple contracts prohibited.] The use of multiple contracts may not be employed in order to avoid compliance with the competitive procedures set forth in sections 2-141.2 through 2-141.6. 
(Ord. No. 2007-22, § 1(exh. A), 12-5-2007; Ord. No. 2009-22, § 5, 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 2012-07, § 1, 4-18-2012; Ord. No. 2018-001, § 1(exh. A), 3-7-2018) 
Sec. 2-143.8. - Capital outlay expenditures. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any other requirements, exceptions, exemptions or limitations on purchases, each item purchased within the capital outlay expenditure category, including, but not limited to, land, buildings, improvements other than buildings, and machinery and equipment, shall require the use of a purchase order. 
(2)  A fixed asset is a durable item, with a long-term nature of use, a normal expected life of one (1) year or more, and a value of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or more at the time of acquisition. Fixed assets include items of real and tangible personal property, of a nonconsumable nature of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2007-22, § 1(exh. A), 12-5-2007; Ord. No. 2012-07, § 1(2-143.8), 4-18-2012) 
Sec. 2-143.8.1. - Request for proposals (RFP). 
(1)  When the purchasing director or designee determines that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be made by use of a request for proposals. Proposals to be sealed shall be solicited through a request for proposals. Public notice of the request for proposals shall be given in the same manner as provided herein relating to an invitation for bids. 
(2)  Sealed proposals shall be opened at the time designated in the public notice of the request for proposals. A list of proposals shall be prepared containing the name of each vendor, the number of modifications received, if any, and a description sufficient to identify the proposal offered. 
(3)  The request for proposals shall state the relative importance of price and other evaluation factors. 
(4)  As provided in the request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible vendors who intended to submit proposals for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of and conformance to the request for proposals. Vendors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to opportunities for discussion and revision of proposals. Revisions may be permitted after submission and prior to award in the discretion of the city for the purpose of obtaining best and final offers. 
(5)  Award shall be made to the responsible vendor whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the city taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. 
(6)  The city may reject all proposals in its sole discretion for any reason and the request for proposals shall so state. 
(7)  The process for making a selection pursuant to the request for proposal shall be as follows: 
(a)  The purchasing director or designee shall appoint a selection evaluation committee having a minimum of three (3) members. All meetings of the selection committee shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the Sunshine Law and all applicants shall receive notice by either mail, fax or e-mail.

To participate the members of the selection committee must be physically present. All members shall be free of any conflicts of interest as set forth in F.S. ch. 112. The selection committee shall then set forth the procedure for reviewing the applicants. The selection committee shall reduce the number of firms to a short list of a minimum of three (3) (provided at least three (3) firms applied). In short-listing firms, the committee shall use the criteria set forth in the RFP and attempt to select the best qualified firms for the particular project based upon the evaluation criteria. The committee may hold discussions with all short-listed firms; however said discussions are not mandatory. 
(b)  The firms shall be ranked in order of preference. This ranking and a report of the committee's analysis shall be provided to the city commission. The city commission, by majority vote, has the option to either: 
1.  Approve the evaluation committee's ranking and recommendation; 
2.  Recommend rejection of all submittals based upon a stated reason; or 
3.  Send the ranking back to the evaluation committee to conduct further evaluations consistent with the requirements of the RFP and the evaluation committee may either ratify the ranking or re-rank the firms. 
Additionally, the city commission reserves the right to re-rank in accordance with section 2-143.10. 
(c)  Upon the city commission approving a ranking, the commission may authorize the purchasing director or designee to negotiate a contract with the top-ranked firm. If the purchasing director or designee is unable to negotiate a contract deemed to be acceptable with the top ranked firm, the purchasing director or designee shall report to the city commission which shall either require that the purchasing director or designee continue negotiations or authorize negotiations with the second-ranked firm until the process is complete or, until the purchasing director or designee or the city commission determines that it is no longer feasible to continue negotiating; at any time the city commission has the full discretion to either abandon the process or begin the process again.

Sec. 2-143.8.2. - Request for qualifications (RFQ) (non CCNA). 
(1)  The purchasing director or designee with the recommendation of the department head in charge of the construction project shall make a determination as to whether the construction project should be bid using the two-step prequalification process. If such a determination is made, the prequalification of bidders shall occur as follows: 
(a)  The city shall develop a request for qualifications (RFQ) describing the project to be bid and indicating that only bidders who are prequalified may bid on the project. The RFQ shall be advertised in the same manner as a request for proposals. 
(b)  The RFQ shall require statements of the background and experience of companies and their principals (president, vice president, and shareholders holding more than thirty (30) percent of the shares) who are going to submit bids; and 
(c)  Potential bidders shall be required to delineate experience on past projects of a similar scope, size and building type; and 
(d)  Potential bidders shall be required to give at least three (3) references related to similar construction projects undertaken within the past three (3) years of a similar size and scope to that being bid; and 
(e)  Potential bidders and their principals (president, vice president, and shareholders holding more than thirty (30) percent of the shares) indicate any litigation in which it has been involved related to provision of construction services, or the payment for contractual services during the past five (5) years. The style of the case and the case number shall be provided, as well as the status and any documentation of any final judgments or verdicts; and 
(f)  Requests for information relative to financial resources and credit worthiness of the potential bidder and qualifier, including bonding information and limits, as deemed appropriate by the city to assure sufficient financial resources and credit worthiness of the potential bidder may be made; and 
(g)  Any other information deemed relevant by the city for prequalification shall be placed in the bid specifications. 
(2)  The purchasing director or designee, shall appoint an evaluation committee (of at least three (3) members) which shall examine the responses for the sole purpose of determining whether the potential bidders have the experience, expertise, financial and physical resources, and responsibility to satisfactorily and timely complete the project. The committee may appoint a representative or representatives to contact all references listed and other persons involved in projects listed by the potential bidder as well as any other person who is deemed to have relevant information as a result of such inquiries. 
(3)  Thereafter, the evaluation committee, at a publically advertised evaluation meeting shall list those potential bidders which it deems qualified by experience, expertise, financial and physical resources, and responsibility to satisfactorily and timely complete the project. Upon approval of the prequalified list of bidders by the city commission, the commission may authorize the purchasing director or designee to issue an invitation to bid to the prequalified bidders. Only those bidders who have been so prequalified may then bid on the project. The purchasing director or designee shall then provide bid packets for bidding the project to prequalified bidders who shall be permitted to bid on the project per the terms of the bid packet. The city commission shall award the bid to the prequalified bidder who submits the lowest responsive, responsible bid.

Sec. 2-143.8.3. - Construction manager at risk process. 
(1)  The city commission may determine that it is in the best interest of the city to provide an alternate procedure for hiring a contractor for a construction contract in the City of Parkland. The procedures as set forth herein are available for construction contracts in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) where the city commission makes a motion determining that the process herein, known as "construction manager at risk" would be in the public interest. The construction manager at risk approach shall provide for a process requiring the contractor to work with the city to provide a guaranteed maximum price and completion date and to implement the project to meet that requirement. Upon making such a motion, the construction contract shall be let as provided herein and in a manner compliant with F.S. § 255.103.

Sec. 2-223. - Administration of the retirement plan. 
(a)  The sole and exclusive administration of, and the responsibility for, proper operation of the retirement plan and for making effective the provisions of this division is vested in a board of trustees. 
(b)  The board of trustees shall consist of five (5) persons; two (2) of whom shall be legal residents of the city and who shall be appointed by the city commission. The city appointees may be members of the city commission, as service on the board is deemed an additional duty of the office of city commissioner.

A fifth member of the board shall be chosen by a majority of the other four (4) trustees, and such person's name shall be submitted to the city commission for appointment. The city commission shall appoint the fifth member selected by the other four (4) trustees as a ministerial duty. Should no active police officer members be available to serve on the board of trustees, retired members of the plan may serve on the board if so elected by membership. If there are no active or retired police officers remaining in the plan or capable of serving, the remaining board members may elect an individual to serve in the active police officer member seat. Upon receipt of such person's name, the city commission shall, as a ministerial duty, appoint such person to the board. 
(c)  All trustees shall serve a term of four (4) years. If a vacancy shall occur prior to the expiration of a member's term, a replacement member shall be chosen in the same manner as the person who has left office. A replacement trustee shall serve a full term measured from the date of replacement. All trustees shall serve until their replacements are selected. A trustee who misses two (2) consecutive meetings without an excuse satisfactory to the board shall be subject to removal for neglect of duty, as permitted by F.S. § 112.501. 
(d)  The board of trustees shall prescribe a uniform election procedure for the selection of the active member trustees. 
(e)  All trustees shall serve without compensation, but they shall be reimbursed from the fund for all necessary expenses authorized by the board. The board shall be permitted to prescribe uniform rules for reimbursement for travel expenditures. 
(f)  The board of trustees shall annually select a chairman and a secretary who shall execute all documents on behalf of the board. 
(g)  A majority of the members of the board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and shall have full power to act under the terms of the plan. Three (3) concurring votes shall be required of the board to take action. 
(h)  The board shall keep minutes of all meetings and a record of any action taken by the board shall be kept in written form and maintained by the board. 
(i)  The board of trustees shall have the authority to make such uniform rules and regulations and to take such action as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the plan and all decisions of the board of trustees, made in good faith, shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties. 
(j)  The board of trustees shall be deemed the named fiduciary of the plan and shall discharge its responsibilities solely in the interest of the members and beneficiaries of the plan for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to the members and their beneficiaries and to defray the reasonable expenses of the plan. The trustees shall exercise those fiduciary responsibilities with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a similar character and with similar aims. 
(k)  The board of trustees shall have the following administrative duties: 
(1)  To maintain such records as are necessary for calculating and distributing retirement benefits; 
(2)  To maintain such records as are necessary for financial accounting and reporting of retirement plan funds; 
(3)  To maintain such records as are necessary for actuarial evaluation of the retirement plan, including investigations into the mortality, service and compensation experience of its members and beneficiaries; 
(4)  To compile such other administrative or investment information as is necessary for the management of the retirement plan; 
(5)  To process, certify and/or respond to all correspondence, bills and statements received by the retirement plan, as well as all applications submitted to the board for retirement benefits; 
(6)  To establish and maintain communication with city departments and other agencies of government as is necessary for the management of the retirement plan, including preparing, filing and distributing such reports and information as are required by law to be prepared, filed or distributed on behalf of the retirement plan; 
(7)  To determine all questions relating to and process all applications for eligibility, participation and benefits; 
(8)  To distribute at regular intervals to employees, a comprehensive summary plan description and periodic reports regarding the financial and actuarial status of the plan; 
(9)  To retain and compensate such professional and technical experience as is necessary to fulfill its fiduciary responsibilities; 
(10)  To make recommendations regarding changes in the provisions of the plan; 
(11)  To assure the prompt deposit of all member contributions, city contributions, Chapter 185 [F.S.] monies, and investment earnings; 
(12)  To establish a uniform set of rules and regulations for the management of the trust; 
(13)  To take such other action as the trustees shall deem, in their sole and exclusive discretion, as being necessary for the efficient management of the plan. 
(l)  The board shall have the authority to retain its own legal counsel, accountants, actuaries and other professional advisors to assist the board in the performance of its duties. The board may act without independent investigation upon the professional advice of the advisors so retained. 
(m)  The board is authorized to prosecute or defend actions, claims or proceedings of any nature or kind for the protection of the fund assets or for the protection of the board in the performance of its duties. 
(n)  Neither the board nor any of its individual members shall have any personal liability for any action taken in good faith. The trustees individually and the board as a whole shall be entitled to the protections in Section 768.28, Fla. Stat. The trustees shall also be authorized to purchase from the assets of the fund, errors and omission insurance to protect the trustees in the performance of their duties. Such insurance shall not provide protection against a trustee's fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful misconduct or gross negligence. 
(o)  No trustee shall be responsible at his or her own expense, to take legal action to correct the misconduct of any other member of the board of trustees. A trustee shall have an affirmative obligation, however, to publicly reveal any misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance by a co-trustee, and upon making such revelation in a public meeting, shall be relieved further individual responsibility of the actions of that co-trustee. 
(Ord. No. 2004-09, § 3, 3-8-2004; Ord. No. 2004-16, § 2, 8-18-2004; Ord. No. 2010-06, § 2, 4-7-2010) 
Sec. 2-224. - Contributions. 
(a)  The city shall pick up, rather than deduct from each member's pay, beginning with the date of employment, five (5) percent of the member's earnable compensation. This pick-up shall be intended to permit the favorable tax treatment of the employee contribution as permitted by section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code by providing that the employee contribution shall be directly transmitted to the plan by the city by reducing the employee's compensation prior to the determination of taxable income. The monies so picked-up shall be deposited in the fund immediately after each pay period. An account record shall be maintained continuously for each member. Pick-up contributions shall continue until death, disability or termination of service, whichever shall occur first. Contributions shall remain in the fund unless withdrawn as provided in the plan. No member shall have the option to choose to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the city directly to the plan. All such pick-up contributions by the city shall be deemed and be considered as part of the member's accumulated contributions and subject to all provisions of the plan pertaining to accumulated contributions of members. The intent of this provision is to comply with section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. For the purpose of accruing and calculating pension benefits, Social Security benefits, overtime compensation, percentage increases to base pay, supplemental percentage payments for particular assignments, education, experience, longevity, years of service, payroll steps, licensure or training, and for paying Social Security taxes, and for such other purposes except as specified in this plan, the amount of employee contributions "picked-up" or paid by the city will be added to the amount distributed on a current basis in order to determine total wages, salary, pay or compensation. 
(b)  All benefits payable under this plan are in lieu of a refund of accumulated contributions. In any event, however, each member shall be guaranteed the payment of benefits at least equal in total amount to the member's accumulated contributions. 
(c)  Any monies received or receivable by reason of the laws of the State of Florida for the express purpose of funding or paying for retirement benefits for police officers shall be deposited into the fund within five (5) business days of receipt by the city. State monies shall be used to provide extra benefits to police officers over and above those provided to general employees of the city. 
(d)  The city shall make such contribution under the Florida Protection of Public Employee Retirement Benefits Act and Chapter 185, Florida Statutes, which together with contributions picked-up on behalf of members, Plan earnings and state insurance premium tax rebates, will maintain the fund on a sound actuarial basis, as determined by the board in conjunction with its actuary. The city's contributions shall be deposited at least quarterly. 
(e)  Expenses, charges and fees attributable to the management of the plan shall be paid from the fund. 
(f)  The city shall have no right, title or interest in the fund or in any part thereof, and no contribution made thereto shall revert to the city, except such part of the fund, if any, which remains therein after the satisfaction of all liabilities to persons entitled to benefits under the plan. 
(g)  Any payment made or picked up on behalf of an employee by the Broward Sheriffs Office shall be considered an employer contribution to the extent permitted by law. 
(Ord. No. 2004-09, § 4, 3-8-2004) 
Sec. 2-225. - Fund management and investments. 
(a)  The plan is hereby established, pursuant to authority granted in the city Charter, as an irrevocable trust fund into which shall be deposited all of the assets of the plan of every kind and description. 
(b)  The actual custody and supervision of the fund shall be vested in the board. All assets of the plan may be commingled, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the fund, including accurate accounts regarding the following: 
(1)  Current amounts of accumulated contributions of members, both on an individual and aggregate basis; 
(2)  Receipts and disbursements; 
(3)  Benefits payments; 
(4)  All contributions from the city; 
(5)  All contributions from the State of Florida pursuant to Chapter 185, [Florida Statutes]; 
(6)  All interest, dividends, gains and losses from investment; 
(7)  Such other entries as may be required for a clear, complete financial report of the status of the fund. 
(c)  The board shall establish a written investment policy, with the advice and counsel of such advisors as the board deems necessary, and said investment policy shall set forth the types of securities and other types of investments into which shall be placed the assets of the fund. The policy shall further set forth appropriate limitations on those investments, including, but not limited to, anticipated rate of return, quality of investment, class of investment and acceptable risk. The board shall have the authority to invest and reinvest the assets of the plan in such securities or property, real or personal, as the board deems appropriate, including, but not limited to: 
(1)  Bonds, notes, or other obligations of the United States or any of its agencies, or those guaranteed by the United States or for which the credit of the United States is pledged for the payment of the principal and interest or dividends thereof; 
(2)  Accounts or certificates of deposit in any bank or other financial institution incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida, or any national bank organized under the laws of the United States, or authorized to do business and situated in the State of Florida, to the extent that such certificates of deposit are secured by the deposits of securities of the United States government; 
(3)  Notes secured by first mortgages on real property insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration or the Veterans Administration; 
(4)  Interest-bearing obligations with a fixed maturity of any corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state or organized territory of the United States and the District of Columbia; provided that such obligations are rated by at least two (2) nationally recognized ratings services in any one (1) of the four (4) highest classifications approved by the comptroller of the currency for the investment of funds of national banks or, if only one (1) nationally recognized ratings service shall rate such obligations, such ratings service must have rated such obligation in any one (1) of the four (4) highest rating classifications as set forth in this subsection; 
(5)  Bonds issued by the State of Israel; 
(6)  Real estate, which may be in the form of commingled ownership and financial institutional futures, listed options, stock index futures, which may be used under specific instruction of managers; 
(7)  Common stock, preferred stock and interest-bearing obligations of domestic corporations having an option to convert into common stock issued by a corporation organized 
under the laws of the United States, any state or organized territory of the United States or any state or organized territory of the United States and the District of Columbia. 
(8)  Index funds, mutual funds, and collective investment funds. 
(9)  Foreign securities, not to exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the portfolio on a market-value basis. 
(10)  Any other investment permitted by law. 
(d)  The board may determine the percentage of each type of investment to be held. 
(e)  The board shall be authorized to retain one (1) of more money managers for the management of property held in the plan, and the board shall convey property of the plan to such money managers for investment and reinvestment in accordance with the terms of this division and the investment policies established by the board. Any such money manager contracting with the board for the investment of its assets shall be deemed a fiduciary of the plan. 
(f)  The board shall have a continuing duty to observe and evaluate the performance of any money manager retained by the board. The board shall, in selecting a money manager or other investment counsel, exercise all judgment and care in the circumstances then prevailing which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs. 
(g)  The board shall require that any money manager or other agent who has custody or control of any property of the plan to keep accurate and detailed accounts of all investments, receipts, disbursements and other transactions pertaining to such trust property, and the board shall further require that all accounts, books and records pertaining thereto be open for inspecting and audit at all reasonable times by the city, the board or the designees. 
(h)  The board shall also keep accurate and detailed accounts of all investments, receipts, disbursements or other transactions pertaining to the trust property and all accounts, books and records pertaining thereto shall be open to inspection and audit at all reasonable times by the city or its designees. 
(i)  The board shall identify and publicly report any direct or indirect holdings it may have in any scrutinized company, as defined in F.S. § 215.473, and proceed to sell, redeem, divest, or withdraw all publicly traded securities it may have in such company beginning January 1, 2010, and shall thereafter be prohibited from purchasing or holding such securities. The divestiture of any such security must be completed by September 10, 2010. In accordance with Ch. 2009-97, Laws of Florida, no person may bring any civil, criminal, or administrative action against the city, board, trustee or any employee, or advisor based upon the divestiture of any security pursuant to this paragraph. 
(Ord. No. 2004-09, § 5, 3-8-2004; Ord. No. 2010-06, § 3, 4-7-2010) 
Sec. 2-226. - Service retirement benefit. 
(a)  A member may retire on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the earlier of: the date upon which the member completes twenty-five (25) years of credited service and attains age fifty-two (52); the date upon which the member completes twenty (20) years of credited service; or the date upon which the member attains age fifty-five (55) with ten (10) years of credited service. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the sole remaining member of the plan shall be permitted to retire without any penalty for early retirement based on existing credited service as of June 15, 2011. There shall be no mandatory retirement age. 
(b)  Subject to the provisions of subsection (j) below, a normal retirement benefit shall be determined by multiplying three (3) percent of final monthly compensation by the number of years of credited service. 
(c)  A service retirement benefit shall be payable on the first day of each month. The benefit shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the member's actual retirement and shall continue until the death of the member, with one hundred and twenty (120) payments guaranteed. Under the normal form of benefit, the ten-year certain and life benefit, payments will be paid for the life of the member, but not for less than ten (10) years certain as set forth in paragraph (h)(3) below. In lieu of the normal form of benefit, members may choose an option form of benefit as provided in paragraph (h). In the event that a member shall retire in the middle of the month, the retirement benefit shall commence on the first day of the following month, but the member shall receive credit for the partial month preceding the actual date that payment commenced. 
(d)  Early service retirement shall be available to a member on the first day of the month coincident with or next following attainment of age fifty (50) and a completion of ten (10) years of credited service. 
(e)  A member electing early retirement may receive either a deferred payment or an immediate payment under the following formula: 
(1)  A deferred payment shall commence on the normal retirement date of the member. This shall mean the date upon which the member attains age fifty-five (55) with ten (10) years of credited service. A deferred payment shall be determined in the same manner as a normal retirement, except that final monthly compensation and credited service shall be based upon the early service retirement date. 
(2)  An immediate retirement benefit may commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date of early service retirement. The benefit shall be determined for normal retirement and then actuarially reduced for the number of actual years and months at which the starting date of the benefit precedes the normal retirement date. The normal retirement date shall be the date upon which the member would have attained age fifty-five (55) with ten (10) years of credited service. The actuarial reduction factor applied to the benefit shall be three (3) percent for each year by which the starting date of the benefit precedes the normal retirement date. 
(f)  The payment of the early service retirement income shall be subject to the same conditions as normal retirement income. 
(g)  In the event a member elects early service retirement, the benefit formula in effect on the early service retirement date shall be applicable to the member. 
(h)  A member entitled to a normal or early service retirement benefit shall have the right at any time prior to the date upon which the first payment is received to elect to have the benefit payable under one (1) of the options provided in this plan. A member shall be permitted to revoke any such election and to elect a new option at any time prior to the receipt of the first payment. Each retirement option shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form. Election of the retirement option shall be on a form prescribed by the board. As set forth in section 2-226(h)(5), after retirement benefits have commenced, a retired member may change the designation of a joint annuitant or beneficiary up to two (2) times without approval of the board or the current joint annuitant or beneficiary. The retired member need not provide proof of good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary. The retiree need not provide proof of the good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed and the joint annuitant or beneficiary need not be living. The rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall thereupon forever cease. The board shall also adjust the member's monthly benefit to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the member's current benefit. 
(1)  Life annuity. A member may elect to receive an enhanced annuity payable for life. There shall be no guaranteed payment in excess of the accumulated contributions of the member, which contributions shall be paid to the member's estate or designated beneficiary should the member die prior to receiving payments equal to said contributions. 
(2)  Joint and last survivor option. In lieu of the normal retirement benefit, and upon written request to the board and subject to the approval of the board of trustees, a member may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value. A member may elect to receive an actuarially reduced benefit for life and to have the benefit (or a designated fraction of the benefit) continued after the member's death and during the lifetime of a designated survivor. Joint and last survivor options shall include a one hundred (100) percent, seventy-five (75) percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent, and a fifty (50) percent option. A designated survivor may be any natural person, but need not be the spouse of the member. In the event that the designated survivor dies, or in the case of a spouse, the marriage is dissolved, before the member's benefit payments begin, this option shall be cancelled automatically and a retirement income shall be payable to the member as if the election had never been made. A member may, at that time, elect an unreduced life annuity or a ten-year certain and life thereafter benefit. 
(3)  Ten (10) year certain and life thereafter. Unless another option is selected, monthly benefits shall be paid in the form of an unreduced life annuity with one hundred twenty (120) guaranteed payments. If the member shall die prior to receiving one hundred twenty (120) payments, the remaining benefits shall be paid to the beneficiary designated by the member. In the event that no beneficiary has been designated, the member's estate shall be the recipient of the remaining balance of payments. This shall be the normal form of retirement. 
(4)  Other options. Such other amount and form of retirement payments or benefit as, in the opinion of the board, will best meet the circumstances of the retiring member. The board, in its sole discretion, may make a lump sum distribution which is the actuarial equivalent of the monthly benefit if the lump sum is not greater than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) or the monthly benefit is less than one hundred dollars ($100.00). 
(5)  Changing joint annuitant. Any retired member who desires to change the joint annuitant or beneficiary shall file with the board of trustees a notarized notice of such change either by registered letter or on such form as is provided by the administrator of the plan. Upon receipt of a completed change of joint annuitant form or such other notice, the board of trustees shall adjust the member's monthly benefit by the application of actuarial tables and calculations developed to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the member's current benefit. Nothing herein shall preclude a plan from actuarially adjusting benefits or offering options based upon sex, age, early service retirement, or disability. If a member has elected an option with a joint survivor or designated beneficiary and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, such member may thereafter change his designated joint survivor or beneficiary up to two (2) times as permitted in F.S. §§ 185.161 and 185.341, without the approval of the board of trustees or the current joint survivor or designated beneficiary. The member need not provide proof of the good health of the joint survivor or beneficiary being removed, and the joint survivor or beneficiary being removed need not be living. After any such change in joint survivor or beneficiary, the member's pension benefit will be recalculated accordingly by the actuary and retirement income shall be payable to the member based on the new calculation. 
(i)  Subject to provisions of subsection (j) below and effective January 1, 2007, and on each January 1 thereafter, any member who has been receiving a retirement benefit for at least one (1) year prior thereto shall receive a cost-of-living adjustment ("COLA") equal to two (2) percent of the member's retirement benefit. 
(j)  The annual COLA provided by subsection (i) and the three (3) percent multiplier provided by subsection (b) shall be funded from the annual state monies received by the retirement plan in excess of nine thousand one hundred and fifty-eight dollars ($9,158.00). The maximum additional state monies that can be used in each year for these benefit enhancements is sixty-nine thousand and six dollars ($69,006.00). The annual COLA provided for in subsection (i) and the three (3) percent multiplier provided for in subsection (b) will be calculated by the actuary and the excess state monies (limited as stated above) shall be applied as follows: 
(1)  To the extent that the excess state monies received by the city are less than sixty-nine thousand and six dollars ($69,006.00), the annual two (2) percent COLA provided to eligible members shall be reduced to a level, of not less than zero (0) percent, that can be funded by excess state monies actually received. Any reductions in future cost-of-living adjustments will not affect any prior cost-of living-adjustments given pursuant to this paragraph. 
(2)  If, after reducing the annual COLA to zero (0) percent, the remaining excess state monies received by the city do not cover the full cost of the three (3) percent multiplier provided for in subsection (b) above, then the three (3) percent multiplier shall be reduced to a level that can be fully funded by the excess state monies actually received provided, however, that in no event shall the multiplier for any year be reduced to less than two (2) percent. 
(3)  Each member, in order to be eligible for the enhanced benefits provided by this subsection (j), shall execute an acknowledgment that the enhanced benefits are dependent upon insurance premium tax rebate money being received by the city pursuant to Chapter 185, Florida Statutes, in an amount sufficient to pay for the enhanced benefits or a portion thereof. 
(Ord. No. 2004-09, § 6, 3-8-2004; Ord. No. 2004-16, §§ 3, 4, 8-18-2004; Ord. No. 2006-44, §§ 1-3, 1-17-2007; Ord. No. 2006-45, § 2, 5-16-2007; Ord. No. 2010-06, § 4, 4-7-2010; Ord. No. 2011-01, § 2, 6-15-2011; Ord. No. 2013-25, § 3, 12-4-2013) 
Sec. 2-227. - Disability. 
(a)  A member shall be disabled under the terms of the plan if the member has suffered an illness, injury or disease which renders the member permanently and totally incapacitated, physically or mentally, from regular and continuous duty as police officer. Disability shall not be determined based solely on the fact that a member cannot perform all of the duties of a police officer as set forth in the job description. The definition of disability shall be applied to an individual who because of illness, injury, or disease, cannot perform any job in the police department which is within the member's physical or mental capabilities and further provided that a vacancy exists which will be made available by the city. The city shall be required to accommodate disabled workers in accordance with state and federal law and shall not withhold assignment to vacant positions on the basis that a member is not capable of performing all of the tasks of a police officer. A disability benefit cannot be based on a condition which pre-existed membership in the plan unless the cause of the disability would reasonably be expected to give rise to a disability in a person without the pre-existing condition. Any pre-existing condition shall be determined from the date of entry of a member into the plan. 
(b)  A member shall be eligible for a service-incurred disability retirement from the entry date into the plan. A service-incurred disability retirement shall mean that the disability arose as a result of an act occurring, or presumed by law to have occurred, in the performance of service with the city. 
(c)  A member shall be eligible for a nonservice incurred disability retirement upon the completion of ten (10) years of credited service. A nonservice incurred disability shall be an illness, injury, or disease, which did not occur as a result of an act in the performance of service with the city. 
(d)  The service-incurred disability benefit shall be paid in equal monthly installments in an amount equal to the member's accrued benefit, but not less than forty-two (42) percent of the member's final monthly compensation as of the date of disability retirement. 
(e)  The nonservice incurred disability benefit shall be paid on a monthly basis in an amount equal to two (2) percent of final monthly compensation multiplied by the number of years of credited service, but shall not be less than twenty-five (25) percent of average monthly compensation. For the purposes of a nonservice incurred disability benefit, final monthly compensation shall be determined as of the last day the member was actively at work for the city. 
(f)  Disability benefits shall be paid on the first day of each month. No benefit shall be paid until the board of trustees has actually considered and voted upon entitlement to disability. A member awarded a service or nonservice incurred disability may select any optional form of benefit available under section 2-226(h). 
(g)  Disability retirement income shall continue until the death of the member, or recovery from disability and return to active police service. In the event of the death of a member who is retired on a disability benefit and has not received one hundred twenty (120) payments, the remaining unpaid benefits shall be paid to a designated beneficiary selected by the member and communicated to the board on the form prescribed by the board. In the event that there is no designated beneficiary, there remaining unpaid benefits shall be paid to the estate of the deceased member. 
(h)  The board of trustees shall have the continuing right to require disabled members to submit to a medical examination to determine that the member remains disabled. In order for a member to be deemed recovered, the medical committee, as provided for in this section, must recommend to the board of trustees that the member has sufficiently recovered to again engage in the duties of a police officer and that the city has certified that it has a position within the police department available for the member consistent with the member's medical condition. 
(i)  Upon finding that a member is no longer disabled, the member shall return to work for the city at the same rank and position previously occupied and shall be placed into the appropriate step in the pay plan which the member would have occupied but for the disability. The member shall again become an active member of the plan and shall receive, if reemployment is accepted, creditable service for any period of time in which the member was receiving disability benefits. If the member declines reemployment with the city, the member shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the date that the disability commenced. In such event, the member may receive a return of contributions unless, prior to that date, the member has received disability benefits equal to or greater than the amount of the accumulated contributions. If the member declines re-employment within the city, the member shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the date that the disability benefit commenced. 
(j)  No member shall be eligible to receive disability benefits from the retirement plan during any period of time that the member is receiving a salary from the city for employment as a police officer. This section shall not apply to the receipt of worker's compensation benefits. 
(k)  Application for disability retirement shall be made on a form prescribed by the board of trustees. The member shall execute such medical releases as are necessary to permit the board of trustees to review the medical records needed to determine the question of disability and to discuss said records at a public meeting. Upon receipt of an application for disability, the board shall appoint a medical committee to be composed of not less than one (1) nor more than three (3) licensed physicians. The applicant for disability shall be required to submit to examination by the medical committee. The medical committee shall report its findings to the board of the trustees which shall include a determination, to the extent reasonably possible, the origin of the disability, whether the disability is permanent, and whether the disability is total. In making that determination, the medical committee shall be bound by the definition of disability set forth in this plan. The board, in its discretion, may expand the medical committee if necessary to fully examine the circumstances of a claim for benefits. The board may also choose to adopt the report of the employee's treating physicians or the city's worker's compensation physicians, or both, as its medical committee. 
(l)  Upon receipt of the report of the medical committee, the trustees shall schedule a public hearing at which time the board shall review all reports of the medical committee, together with any such documentary evidence as the applicant may wish to submit. The board shall conduct a preliminary determination as to whether the member is permanently and totally disabled based upon the written documentation presented. If the board does not grant the application based on the written documentation, it shall inform the member in writing of the reasons for the denial of the application. The member may, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the board's preliminary denial, request a full evidentiary hearing before the board. Said hearing will be conducted consistent with the principles of due process and the rules of evidence generally applicable to administrative proceedings shall apply. The board shall have the power to issue subpoenas compelling the attendance of witnesses. At said hearing the applicant may present such oral and written evidence as the applicant deems necessary to establish its burden of proof. The board may appoint special counsel as an advocate to cross-examine witnesses and to offer argument in opposition to the application. The attorney for the board shall not serve both as advocate and as advisor to the board in the same proceeding. The applicant and the board shall have the right to examine and cross-examine all witnesses. The decision of the board shall be based solely upon the evidence presented and the law applicable to this plan. Following the conclusion of the hearing, the board shall render an opinion in writing setting forth the reasons for the grant or denial of the benefit. In the event that the disability benefit is denied, the applicant shall have the right to judicial review by complaint for common law certiorari in the Circuit Court of Broward County. 
(m)  The board of trustees may prescribe rules of procedure to implement the provisions of this plan relating to the conduct of disability hearings. 
(n)  No member shall be granted a disability pension upon a determination by the board that the disability resulted from: 
(1)  Excessive and habitual use of drugs, intoxicants or narcotics; 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots, civil insurrections or while committing a crime; 
(3)  Any occurrence arising from compensable employment unrelated to regular city employment; 
(4)  Injury or disease incurred while engaged in military service. 
(o)  For the purposes of this section the term "city" shall also mean the "Broward County Sheriff's Office." 
(Ord. No. 2004-09, § 7, 3-8-2004; Ord. No. 2004-16, § 5, 8-18-2004) 
Sec. 2-228. - Vesting and termination. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, all rights to benefits under this plan shall terminate when a member's employment terminates for any reason other than normal service retirement, early service retirement, or disability retirement. Any member who completes ten (10) years of credited service and whose contributions remain in the plan has a vested right to accrued benefits from the plan. No member who has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service shall have a vested interest in any accrued benefit. 
(b)  A member who shall leave the service of the city prior to eligibility for normal service retirement or early service retirement, but who has completed ten (10) years of creditable service shall be entitled to receive retirement benefits commencing at the regular normal service retirement date. Such benefits will be based on final monthly compensation and credited service as of the date of termination. If any deferred vested member who has been in the service of the city for at least ten (10) years elects to leave his or her accrued contributions with the plan, the member may select early service retirement upon attaining age fifty (50) or older. Early service retirement benefits shall be paid at the actuarial equivalent of the amount of such retirement income otherwise payable, as provided in F.S. § 185.16(4). 
(c)  Every member shall have the right to elect in writing (in a form and manner determined by the board) to receive, in lieu of all benefits under the plan, a return of the member's accumulated contributions. 
(d)  A member who elects a lump sum return of contributions releases and discharges the city and the retirement plan from the right to any other benefits from the plan. A member who terminates service prior to achieving a vested interest in the plan shall have the right to receive a refund of accumulated employee contributions. 
(e)  If a member who has terminated service prior to retirement re-enters the police department, the member will be entitled to reinstate the credited service that the member had on the date of termination in lieu of the benefits to which the member became entitled at time of separation. If, at the time of separation, the member withdrew the member's accumulated contributions, credited service can only be restored by repaying to the pension plan an amount equal to the accumulated contributions plus five (5) percent interest from the date the contributions were withdrawn. 
(Ord. No. 2004-09, § 8, 3-8-2004; Ord. No. 2004-16, § 6, 8-18-2004; Ord. No. 2013-25, § 4, 12-4-2013) 
Sec. 2-229. - Death benefits. 
(a)  In the event of the death of a member prior to the time of eligibility for early or normal retirement, the member's designated beneficiary shall be paid from the fund an amount equal to the member's accumulated contributions. In the event of the death of a member who has completed ten (10) or more years of credited service, the member designated beneficiaries shall be entitled to the benefits otherwise payable at the early or normal retirement date. 
(b)  In the event of the death of a retiree, death benefits, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the optional form of benefit chosen at the time of retirement. 
(c)  In the event of a death or disability occurring on or after January 1, 2007, if a participant dies while performing qualified military service (as defined in Section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code), the survivors of the participant are entitled to any additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) provided under the plan as if the participant had resumed and then terminated employment by the city on account of death. 
(Ord. No. 2004-09, § 9, 3-8-2004; Ord. No. 2015-07, § 1, 5-20-2015) 
Sec. 2-230. - Compliance with the Internal Revenue Code. 
(a)  It is the intention of the city and of the board that the plan remain at all times a qualified plan, as that term is defined under the Internal Revenue Code. 
(b)  No member's annual benefit shall exceed the amounts permitted in section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(c)  (1)  In no event may a member's retirement benefit be delayed beyond the later of April 1 following the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2), or such later date as may be established by law, or April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which the member retires. 
(2)  When a distribution of the participant's entire interest is not made in a lump sum, the distribution will be made in or more of the following ways: over the life of the participant; over the life of the participant and designated beneficiary; over a period certain not extending beyond the life expectancy of the participant; or over a period certain not extending beyond the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and a designated beneficiary. 
(d)  If the distribution has commenced before the participant's death, the remaining interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of the participant's death. The method of distribution, if the participant dies before distribution is commenced, must satisfy the following requirements: 
(1)  Any remaining portion of the participant's interest that is not payable to a beneficiary designated by the participant will be distributed within five (5) years after the participant's death; 
(2)  Any portion of the participant's interest that is payable to a beneficiary designated by the participant will be distributed either: (i) within five (5) years after the participant's death; or (ii) over the life of the beneficiary, or over a period certain not extending beyond the life expectancy of the beneficiary, commencing not later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the participant died (or, if a designated beneficiary is the participant's surviving spouse, commencing not later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age seventy and one-half (701/2)), or such later date as established by law. 
    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all distributions from the plan shall conform to the regulations issued under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(e)  Direct transfers of eligible distributions shall be made as follows: 
(1)  General. Except as otherwise provided hierein, this subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this subsection, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution made directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Retiree medical premiums for public safety officers. Effective the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2009, the plan may allow a public safety officer to elect a tax free distribution of up to three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) annually directly to a retiree medical plan or long term care insurance on a pre-tax basis, so long as the public safety officer separates from service either at the plan's normal retirement age or due to his or her disability. Insurance premiums may be paid for the public safety officer, his spouse or his dependents while he is alive, but once he is deceased, the benefit ceases and may not be used by his spouse or beneficiaries to pay for their insurance premiums. Insurance premium payments may only be made directly to the insurance company. "Public safety officers" include law enforcement officers, firefighters, chaplains, rescue crew members or ambulance crew members. 
(3)  Definitions. 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of a distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one (1) of a series of a substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income. 
b.  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code that accepts a distributee's eligible rollover distribution. Effective for distributions made after December 31, 2001, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amount transferred into such plan from this plan. 
c.  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse.

d.  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. Effective as of January 1, 2008, a non-spouse beneficiary may make a direct rollover only to an "inherited" individual retirement account as described in section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. If a non-spouse beneficiary receives a distribution form the plan, the distribution is not eligible for a sixty-day (non-direct) rollover. 
(Ord. No. 2004-09, § 10, 3-8-2004; Ord. No. 2013-25, § 5, 12-4-2013; Ord. No. 2015-07, § 3, 5-20-2015) 
Sec. 2-231. - Amendment or termination of the system. 
(a)  It is the intention of the city and the board that this pension plan shall constitute an irrevocable trust and no portion of the assets may revert to the employer until all other obligations of the plan, including the payment to the last surviving member and beneficiary has been paid. No amendment shall result in members receiving lower benefits than those in effect on the date the member commenced service with the city. 
(b)  Upon termination of the system by the city for any reason or because of a transfer, merger, or consolidation of governmental units, services, or functions as provided in chapter 121, or upon written notice by the city to the board that contributions under the system are being permanently discontinued, the rights of all members to benefits accrued to the date of such termination and the amounts credited to the members' accounts are one hundred (100) percent vested and non-forfeitable. The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the non-forfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city if additional assets are required, in which event the city shall continue to financially support the system until all non-forfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(2)  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each member entitled to benefits under the system as specified in subsection (3). 
(3)  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, expect that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the member's accumulated contributions to the system, with interest, if provided by the system, less the value of any system benefits previously paid to the member. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the system, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state. 
(5)  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (2), the amounts determined under subsection (3). 
    If, after twenty-four (24) months after the date the system terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereuder were being permanently discontinued, the city or the board of the system's pension trust fund affected has not complied with all the provisions of this section, the department of management services shall effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section. 
(Ord. No. 2004-09, § 11, 3-8-2004; Ord. No. 2010-06, § 5, 4-7-2010; Ord. No. 2013-25, § 6, 12-4-2013) 
Sec. 2-232. - Distribution of marital interests in the plan. 
(a)  In the event that the board is served with a domestic relations order or other legal process purporting to require the payment of any portion of a member's benefit to another person as a result of a dissolution of marriage, the board shall cause such order to be reviewed to determine compliance with the provisions of the plan. 
(b)  The board of trustees shall be authorized to intervene in any such dissolution of marriage proceeding to ensure that such domestic relations order is otherwise consistent with the distribution of an interest in a public employees retirement plan under state law. 
(c)  Any cost associated with the modification or correction of such domestic relations orders shall be the responsibility of the plan member and payment of any such cost shall be a condition precedent to the receipt of benefits from the plan. 
(d)  The board of trustees may, upon written request by a retiree, or by a dependent, when authorized by the retiree or the retiree's beneficiary, authorize the plan administrator to withhold from the monthly retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the governmental entity from which the employee retired, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the governmental entity, and to make any payments for child support or alimony. The board may, upon the written request of a retiree, authorize the plan administrator to withhold from the retiree's retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for premiums for accident, health, and long-term care insurance for the retiree and the retiree's spouse and dependents. The pension plan, the board and the city shall not incur any liability for actions taken in good faith, at the retiree's written request. 
(Ord. No. 2004-09, § 12, 3-8-2004; Ord. No. 2004-16, § 7, 8-18-2004; Ord. No. 2010-06, § 6, 4-7-2010) 
Sec. 2-233. - Miscellaneous. 
(a)  The present or future right of a person to money in the pension fund or to a retirement allowance, an optional allowance, a death benefit, the return of contributions, or any other right accrued or accruing under the provisions of this plan shall not be assignable and shall not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or insolvency law or any other process of law whatsoever, except as provided in F.S. § 185.05(6). 
(b)  The board shall have the power to examine into the facts upon which any pension has been granted under any prior or existing law or which may be granted in the future or obtained erroneously, fraudulently, or illegally for any reason. The board is empowered to purge the pension rolls of any person who has been granted a pension under a prior or existing law, or who is hereafter granted a benefit under this division if the granting of that pension is found to be erroneous, fraudulent, or illegal for any reason; and to reclassify any pensioner who has under any prior or existing law or who may under this division be erroneously, improperly or illegally classified. 
(c)  Should any change or error in retirement system records be discovered or result in any member or beneficiary receiving from the retirement plan more or less than he or she would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, the board shall have the power to correct such error and, as far as possible, adjust the payments in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of a benefit to which such member or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid. 
(d)  If any member or beneficiary is a minor or is under any other legal disability, the board of trustees shall have the power to withhold payment of benefits until the board is presented with proof satisfactory to the board of the appointment of a guardian. If the board becomes aware that any member or beneficiary is incapable of personally receiving and giving a valid receipt for any payment due under the plan, the board shall cause notice to be given to that participant or beneficiary of a hearing to determine whether said benefits should continue to be paid until the appointment of a guardian. During the pendency of any such hearing, however, the board may continue to pay benefits to the member or beneficiary and that such payment shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the plan for such payment. 
(e)  Any person who willfully and knowingly makes, or cause to be made, or assists, conspires with, urges another to make, or causes to be made, any fraudulent, or misleading oral or written statement or withholds or conceals material information to obtain any benefit available under this plan shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable under F.S. §§ 775.082 and 775.083. In addition to any applicable criminal penalty, any beneficiary or participant in this plan who is convicted of this offense may, in the discretion of the board, be required to forfeit any benefits payable under this plan. For the purposes of this section, the term "conviction" shall mean a determination of guilt whether by plea or trial, whether or not adjudication is withheld. 
(f)  At a time of its choosing, the city shall have the authority to purchase annuities to cover the value of the "base benefit" under the plan, prior to the adoption of Ordinance 2006-45 which increased the multiplier from two (2) percent to three (3) percent and created a two-percent COLA funded with premium tax revenue. After the annuities are purchased, the board shall be responsible for paying the benefits adopted by Ordinance 2006-45, with available premium tax revenue, consistent with state law. By purchasing annuities from a reputable third party insurance company, the city intends to reduce all unfunded actuarial liabilities and minimize the risk of financial market volatility. Nevertheless, the city recognizes that it is ultimately responsible as the plan sponsor to guarantee payments, in the event of default or insolvency by the annuity provider. For this reason, the city reserves all rights to receive a credit against future Chapter 185 revenue in the event of future amendments to Chapter 185. 
(g)  USERRA. Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, effective as of December 12, 1994, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, USERRA, and F.S. ch. 185, as applicable. 
(h)  Differential wage payments. For years beginning after December 31, 2009, (i) an individual receiving a differential wage payment, as defined in section 3401(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be treated as an employee of the employers making the payment, (ii) the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation, and (iii) the plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of any provision described in section 414(u)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code by reason of any contribution or benefit which is based on the differential wage payment.

ARTICLE II. - NUISANCE ABATEMENT PROGRAM 

Sec. 4-21. - Generally. 
(a)  Authority. The City of Parkland, hereby declares its authority under Florida law and the provisions hereof to determine and declare the existence of a public nuisance and shall have the authority to provide for the abatement of same. Abatement of such nuisances constitutes a municipal service, which specifically benefits the property upon which the nuisance is abated and all costs incurred by the city in abating such nuisances shall be levied as a special assessment pursuant to section F.S. § 170.201, and/or all other applicable law. 
(b)  Findings. The city commission finds that conditions exist within the City of Parkland, which violate public rights, subvert public order, decency, or morals, or cause inconvenience or damage to the public generally. Specifically, the accumulation of underbrush, weeds, rubbish, trash, and grass on improved property; the existence of unsafe dwellings and other structures on improved property; and the creation of pools, ponds, other bodies of water, or conditions which endanger the public health, welfare, property value, or safety of the community, has become an ever-increasing menace in the city and constitutes a nuisance. It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to create a nuisance, or suffer or permit a nuisance to exist, upon property, which is under his, her, or its care, custody or control. 
    The city acting at the direction of the city commission shall have the authority to and shall take steps to ensure the abatement of public nuisances in the most aggressive manner provided by the City of Parkland Code of Ordinances or state law. The abatement of such nuisances protects the public health, safety and welfare, enhances the value of the property, involves the furnishing of vital municipal services, and specifically benefits the property on which the nuisance is abated. The cost of any abatement, including administrative fees and costs, shall constitute a special assessment upon the benefited property. 
(c)  Public nuisance abatement program established. There is hereby established a City of Parkland Nuisance Abatement Program for the purpose of abating the public nuisances defined herein. The owner of any property located within the City of Parkland who creates, suffers, or permits a nuisance to exist upon his or her property, shall be responsible for abating the nuisance and, if the owner fails to abate the nuisance in accordance with the notice given pursuant to this chapter, the city may abate the nuisance and the city shall be reimbursed for the costs associated with the abatement pursuant to the provisions of this chapter for the recovery of those costs. The definitions, procedures and standards set forth herein shall apply only if the city elects to use the nuisance abatement program and the procedures set forth herein and shall not apply to the code procedures set forth in section 22-144 which is a separate process with standards and definitions as set forth therein. 
(d)  Public nuisance abatement program trust fund established. There is hereby established an interest bearing public nuisance abatement program trust fund for the deposit, maintenance, and distribution of any assessment funds collected or expended as a result of the public nuisance abatement program. The assessment imposed on a benefited property and collected by the city shall include the actual cost of abating the nuisance, the cost of serving notice, the cost of obtaining title information, the cost of lien recordation, the cost of inspections, and all other specifically related costs. Any funds in the trust fund may be used to abate public nuisances on property to which title is not clear, abate nuisances on government property, which may not be assessed, or for other purposes directly related to the abatement of nuisances. 
(e)  Definitions. As used in this chapter the following terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them in this section: 
    Abandoned building shall mean a single-family residential unit or a commercial building which has not been occupied for a period of more than sixty (60) consecutive days and for which the owner, tenant or manager (for commercial buildings) has ceased to exercise care and control. At a minimum, this shall require evidence that the building has ceased to be served by electric service for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days. Abandonment shall be a question of fact which must be determined by the special master. 
    Nuisance shall mean any of the following provided that the condition poses a direct and immediate threat to public health or safety and is within an abandoned building or on a residential lot containing an abandoned building: 
(1)  Any public nuisance known at common law or in equity jurisprudence or as provided by the statutes of the state and ordinances of the city, including this chapter. 
(2)  Any accumulation of rubbish, trash, refuse, junk, and other abandoned materials, metals, lumber, or other things, which based upon the facts and circumstances of the accumulation poses a direct and immediate threat to the public health safety and welfare. 
(3)  The existence of excessive accumulation or untended growth of weeds, grass, undergrowth, brush, or other dead or living plant life upon an improved lot, tract or parcel of land, in such proximity to any improved property within the City of Parkland to the extent and in the manner that such improved lot, tract or parcel of land is infested or inhabited with rodents, vermin, wild animals, bees or snakes or has become a breeding place for mosquitoes or which poses a fire hazard. Any "attractive nuisance" or condition which is likely to prove detrimental to the health and safety of children, whether on an improved or unimproved lot, tract or parcel of land including, but not limited to, abandoned wells, shafts, excavations, abandoned appliances, abandoned or inoperable motor vehicles, or vegetation such as poison ivy, oak, or sumac, which are likely to prove a hazard for inquisitive minors land used for bona fide agricultural purposes shall be exempted from this subsection. 
(4)  Any underbrush, weeds, or untended grass which exceeds two (2) feet in height located on improved property and is seen to be harboring animals or insects which pose a direct and immediate threat to the public health safety and welfare. 
(5)  The carcasses of animals or fowl not disposed of within a reasonable time after death which poses a direct and immediate threat to the public health safety and welfare. 
(6)  The pollution of any public well or cistern, stream, lake, canal or body of water by sewage, dead animals, industrial wastes, or other substances. 
(7)  Any accumulation of stagnant water or sewage permitted or maintained on any improved lot, premises, or piece of ground which poses a direct and immediate threat to the public health safety and welfare. 
(8)  Continuous dense smoke, noxious fumes, gas, soot or cinders, in unreasonable quantities which poses a direct and immediate threat to the public health safety and welfare. 
(9)  Unsheltered storage for a period of thirty (30) days or more within the corporate limits of this city (except in licensed junkyards) of old and unused stripped junk and other automobiles not in good and safe operating condition; and of any other vehicles, machinery, implements, or equipment or personal property of any kind which is no longer safely usable for the purposes for which it was manufactured, is hereby declared to be a nuisance if it is determined to be a direct and immediate threat to the public health, safety or welfare; land used for bona fide agricultural purposes shall be exempted from this subsection. 
(10)  Such other acts or conditions which are determined and declared by other ordinances or by resolution of city commission to be or constitute a direct and immediate threat to the public health or safety. 
    Nuisance inspector shall mean the city manager or the designee thereof. 
    Refuse shall mean leavings, dregs, rubbish, trash or waste material. 
    Special master shall mean the special master appointed as needed by the City of Parkland City Commission. Special masters shall be active or retired members of the Florida Bar with at least five (5) years of experience. Special masters shall not be city employees but may be compensated at a rate to be determined by the city manager, subject to approval by the city commission. Unless otherwise specified by resolution, the code enforcement special master shall serve as the special master for the purposes set forth herein. 
    Underbrush shall mean any undergrowth or brush conducive to the collection of insects and rodents, which may be or may become a fire hazard, or may negatively impact adjoining property. 
    Unfit or unsafe dwelling or structure shall mean any dwellings or structure or portions thereof and accessory buildings which the building official determines are structurally unsafe, unstable, or unsanitary; inadequately provided with exit facilities; constitute a fire hazard; unsuitable or improper for the use or occupancy to which they are put; constitute a hazard to health or safety because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence or abandonment; dangerous to life or property of the occupant thereof or of the surrounding areas; unfit for human habitation if so intended or used; or otherwise in violation of the housing, building, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, sanitation and fire codes of the city. 
    Weeds shall mean any plants that are useless, invasive, or injurious to crops, grasses, landscaping scrubs, trees, or flowers. 
(f)  Nuisance abatement program: supplemental means of enforcement. 
(1)  Pursuant to section F.S. §§ 162.13 and 166.0415(7), the nuisance abatement program is a supplemental means of enforcing city codes and ordinances. A public nuisance also constitutes a code violation and the city is not limited to a choice of remedy to ensure compliance with its codes. Code enforcement proceedings are punitive and involve fines levied against the subject property, which may be collected pursuant to F.S. § 162.09. In contrast, nuisance abatement pursuant to this chapter is remedial in nature and specifically designed to immediately, or as soon as practicable, bring the property into compliance, thereby protecting the public welfare and directly improving and benefiting the property upon which the nuisance is abated. 
(2)  In addition to nuisance abatement proceedings, the city may institute code enforcement proceedings against a property for an occurrence of a violation. However, once the subject violation/nuisance is abated, that occurrence of the code violation has ceased and no further code enforcement penalties may accrue for that specific occurrence. 
(3)  Repeat nuisance violations. Following the first notice under this chapter to abate a nuisance as described herein, any subsequent violation of the same nuisance classification(s) on the same property within a twelve-month period may be abated by the city without further notice so long as the initial notice and order of abatement specifically provides for such subsequent abatement therein. All costs of abating the repeat nuisance, including administrative fees and costs, shall constitute a special assessment against said property. 
(g)  Powers and duties of the nuisance inspector. 
(1)  The nuisance inspector and/or his/her designees (i.e. code enforcement personnel) shall be charged with the duty of administering the applicable standards and reporting noncompliance therewith and in furtherance of this responsibility, the nuisance inspector and/or designees shall make such inspections, compile such facts and evidence, and prepare such reports as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes and intent of this chapter. The nuisance inspector's findings, evidence and reports shall be promptly forwarded to the city attorney's office for review. 
(2)  When necessary to obtain entry upon private property in order to enforce the provisions of this chapter, the nuisance inspector may institute appropriate proceedings to obtain a warrant. 
(3)  In the case of an obvious unfit and unsafe dwelling, structure, or other condition which after inspection is determined to be uninhabited, the nuisance inspector shall authority to cause to be posted a "No Trespassing" sign in an attempt to warn third parties who might be exposed to the risk of danger created by the unsafe condition. However, the City of Parkland does not assume any liability for harm to third parties caused by the unfit and unsafe dwelling, structure, or condition under any circumstances. 
(h)  Nuisance abatement enforcement procedure. If the nuisance inspector determines that a nuisance as defined in this chapter exists on a parcel of property, the nuisance inspector shall notify the owner and give him or her a reasonable time to correct the nuisance. Should the nuisance continue beyond the time specified for correction, the nuisance inspector shall schedule a hearing before the special master. Written notice of such hearing to the property owner shall be hand delivered or mailed in the same manner as provided for in F.S. § 162.12. Notice may additionally be served by publication or posting in the same manner as provided in F.S. § 162.12. If the property is in foreclosure proceedings and has been abandoned by the owner(s) as evidenced by the property being vacant and the owner has not provided a forwarding address nor is participating in the foreclosure proceedings by filing an answer or has otherwise been unable to be served, service by certified mail to the owner(s) last address of record and service upon the bank or mortgage company of record in the foreclosure proceedings by certified mail shall be deemed sufficient notice. 
    Notice of the hearing before the special master shall: 
(1)  Identify the property at issue; 
(2)  Identify the owner or owners of the property as ascertained by a reasonable search of the property appraiser's records or search of the public records; 
(3)  Describe the condition or activity which may constitute a public nuisance; 
(4)  Set the date, time, and place for the hearing before the special master at which the owner(s) shall have the opportunity to present such evidence and or argument to the special master as to why said building, structure or condition should not be considered a nuisance and its abatement, removal, or destruction required; 
(5)  Include a statement providing that a failure to respond or appear at the hearing shall be deemed an admission of the existence of a public nuisance on the property at issue which may result in abatement of the nuisance by the city and levy of an assessment against the property pursuant to this chapter. 
(i)  Order of abatement. 
(1)  The hearing before the special master shall be an evidentiary hearing. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings. At or after such hearing, the special master shall issue an order including findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon competent substantial evidence. If the special master finds that a nuisance exists, and that the nuisance poses a direct and immediate threat to the public health safety such that prompt action must be taken to avoid such injury, the special master shall issue an order of abatement affirming the existence or the nuisance and requiring the owner of the property to abate the nuisance condition(s) within a reasonable time to be determined by the special master in the order and provide for abatement of the nuisance by city forces if such conditions are not corrected as of the time determined by the special master. The order of abatement shall include specific findings of fact supporting the conclusion that the building is abandoned and that the nuisance poses a direct and immediate threat to the public health safety such that prompt action must be taken to avoid such injury and a statement advising that upon the owner's failure to comply with the order, the city may take the necessary steps to abate the nuisance in accordance with the order of abatement. Because of the special benefit this will have to the subject property, the expense of such performance by the city or its contractor shall be charged against the real property as a special assessment and such special assessment lien shall be coequal with the lien of all state, county, district, an municipal taxes and superior in dignity to mortgages and all other liens, irrespective of the date of the recording of the municipal lien or the date of the recording of any mortgage or any other lien or real property. A failure to pay said lien, even such lien upon homestead property, may be collected pursuant to any manner specified by law and may result in a loss of title to the property. 
(2)  The special master may require any or all measures as are reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance. These measures may include, but are not necessarily limited to, the cutting of vegetation, removal of debris or abandoned materials, repair or maintenance of structures, and/or the demolition of unfit or unsafe structures. 
(3)  A certified copy of the order of abatement may be recorded in the public records of Broward County and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns and shall be binding upon such subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. 
(j)  Extension of time to comply. In the event of extenuating circumstances such that the property owner(s) is/are unable to complete abatement within the time provided within the order, the owner(s) may file a written request before the special master for an extension of time to comply stating the reasons they have been unable to complete compliance. If reasonable grounds are shown, the special master is authorized to extend the time in which to complete compliance with the original order. 
(k)  Failure to comply. If the owner or other parties in interest fail to comply with an order made pursuant to the provisions of this chapter within the time therein fixed, the city is authorized (but no required to) to vacate, demolish, remove, or otherwise abate the nuisance in accordance with such order, either with city forces or by an independent contractor and neither shall be held liable for trespass, conversion, or other damages while abating the nuisance in a reasonable manner. 
(l)  Emergency order. Whenever, in the opinion of the city commission, any nuisance in violation of this chapter is an immediate threat to life, limb, health, welfare, or property, the city commission may (but shall not be required to) issue an emergency order and immediately terminate or abate the nuisance. 
(m)  Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any order entered under this article may file an appeal to the Circuit Court of Broward County. Such appeal shall not be a hearing de novo but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before special master. The appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the rendition of the final order to be appealed. 
(n)  Attorney's fees. The prevailing party in any legal action, appeal, or proceeding instituted to contest any city council or nuisance abatement board order or action pursuant to this chapter shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs notwithstanding, in the event the city prevails, that the attorney handling the matter may be an employee of the city. 
(o)  Assessment of cost. 
(1)  The abatement of the nuisance shall be deemed to specially benefit the property owner and shall therefore constitute a special assessment against the property so benefited. The city commission shall assess the entire cost of city abatement action upon the affected property as a special assessment, which assessment, when made, shall constitute a lien upon such property by the city. The lien of the city shall encompass, in addition to the costs of abatement, all administrative, legal, postal and publication expenses, as well as all other direct or indirect costs associated therewith. The lien upon the property shall be superior to all others except taxes as previously set forth herein. 
(2)  The city shall file such lien in the Official Records of Broward County showing the nature of such lien, the amount thereof, an accurate legal description of the property, including the street address, which lien shall date from the date of the filing and recite the owners of the property. Such municipal lien shall bear interest from such date at the rate of eight (9) percent per annum. However, the assessment may be paid without interest at any time within thirty (30) days after the improvement is completed. The city may enforce the lien upon the real property of the owner, as provided for in F.S. ch. 173, as amended from time to time. 
(3)  In the alternative, the city may collect all such liens assessed pursuant to F.S. § 197.3632, as authorized pursuant to F.S. § 197.3632(9).

If, upon personal investigation, the code enforcement officer finds that the person has not corrected the violation within the designated time period, the code enforcement officer may issue a citation to the person who has committed the violation; the property owner which placed the solid waste or bulk waste for collection shall be deemed the violator. 
(3)  The code enforcement officer is not required to provide the alleged violator with a reasonable period of time to collect the violation prior to issuing the notice to appear if a repeat violation is found, or if the code enforcement officer has reason to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety or welfare, or that the violator is engaged in violations of a itinerant or transient nature, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible. A repeat violation is a violation of a provision of code or ordinance by a person who has been previously found in violation by a code enforcement special magistrate, or through the process set forth herein, or any other quasi-judicial or judicial process, to have violated, or who has admitted violating the same provision within five (5) years prior to the violation, notwithstanding the violations occur at different locations.

(e)  Brief description of the nature of the violation, including location, date and time of violation; 
(f)  Amount of the applicable civil penalty; 
(g)  Procedure of the person to follow to pay the civil penalty, or to contest the citation; 
(h)  Notice that if the person fails to pay the civil penalty within the time allowed, and fails to request an administrative hearing within ten (10) calendar days of service (if case assigned to special magistrate), the person shall be deemed to have waived their rights to contest the citation and that, in such case, judgment may be entered up to the maximum civil penalty as set forth herein. 
(i)  Notice that the person may be liable for reasonable costs of the hearing should the violator be found guilty of the violation. 
(5)  Service of the citation shall be evidenced by a citation signed by the violator or by certified mail, return receipt requested, provided the citation is sent to the owner of the property in question at the address listed with the property appraiser's office and at any other address provided to the local government by such owner. If the certified mail is returned as unclaimed or refused, service may be provided by posting at least ten (10) days prior to the scheduled hearing date, in at least two (2) locations, one (1) of which shall be the property upon which the violation exists and the other shall be in Parkland City Hall.

(6)  The following procedure shall be followed upon issuance of a citation: 
(a)  The person who has been served with a citation to appear before a special magistrate shall either correct the violation, and pay the civil penalty in the manner indicated on the citation; or 
(b)  Request an administrative hearing before a special magistrate to appeal the decision of the code enforcement officer. Said appeal shall be in writing and shall be tiled not later than ten (10) calendar days after the service of the citation. 
(c)  The hearing shall be set by the city clerk no earlier than ten (10) days after receipt of the notice of appeal and no more than forty-five (45) days after receiving the notice. The city clerk shall mail notice of the hearing date to the alleged violator at least seven (7) calendar days before the hearing by certified mail return receipt requested. Failure to claim the mailed notice shall not cause the notice to be deemed deficient. 
(7)  The notice of hearing shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
(a)  Name of the inspector who issued the notice; 
(b)  Factual description of alleged violation; 
(c)  Date of alleged violation; 
(d)  Section of the code allegedly violated; 
(e)  Place, date and time of the hearing; 
(f)  Right of violator to be represented by an attorney; 
(g)  Right of violator to present witnesses and evidence; 
(h)  Notice that failure of violator to attend hearing may result in imposition of a civil penalty. 
(i)  Notice that requests for continuances will not be considered if not received in writing by the code enforcement officer at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the date set for hearing. 
(8)  At the hearing the city shall have the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists. The special magistrate has the authority to conduct the hearing in manner consistent with the rules set forth herein and to take all necessary actions to carry out the rules and procedures set forth herein in order to reach a decision based upon the evidence presented. The strict rules of evidence shall not apply at the hearing but the hearing officer shall conduct the hearing so as to assure that the rights of fundamental due process have been provided the alleged violator. The city and the alleged violator may introduce evidence and call witnesses and cross examine witnesses. Any evidence that the special magistrate deems competent and reliable may be admitted regardless of the existence of some statutory or common law rule to the contrary. All testimony shall be under oath. The special magistrate shall issue a written order either affirming the decision of the code enforcement office, reversing said decision or modifying said decision; if the order finds a violation the special magistrate shall issue findings of fact. 
(9)  Failure of the violator to appeal the decision of the code enforcement officer within the ten (10) calendar days shall constitute a waiver of the violator's right to an administrative hearing. A waiver of the right to an administrative hearing shall be treated as an admission of the violation and may result in the imposition of a fine against the violator for an amount up to the maximum civil penalty as set forth below. 
(10)  Should the violator appeal the citation and be found in violation by the special magistrate, in addition to the imposition of a fine, the violator shall be assessed an administrative cost of one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00). The special magistrate shall not waive the administrative costs. Should the violator waive their right to an administrative hearing, in addition to the imposition of the fine, the violator shall be assessed an administrative cost of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) that shall not be waived by the special magistrate. 
(11)  The following constitutes the fines for violation of sections 7-31 through 7-38: 
(a)  First offense ..... $100.00 
(b)  Second offense ..... $200.00 
(c)  Third and subsequent offenses ..... $250.00 
(d)  The special magistrate shall have authority to mitigate the amount of any fine provided for herein based upon a finding that, given the circumstances presented at the hearing, a fine in accordance with the standards set forth herein is not justified based upon and one (1) of the following: i) the violator acted in good faith to cure the violation in the time provided; or ii) the violator can show special circumstances existed which made cure within the time provided a hardship, which hardship was not shared by others similarly situated. The administrative fee may not be waived. 
(12)  The city manager, or his/her designee, shall provide the appropriate guidelines and procedures for the administration, collection, record keeping, reporting and accountability of fines assessed under this article. 
(13)  If the special magistrate finds that a violation exists and assesses the fine, or if the violator does not contest the citation as provided under this article, and the violator fails to pay the applicable fine, the special magistrate may enter an order imposing the fines previously set, plus administrative costs. A certified copy of the order imposing a civil penalty, plus administrative costs, may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the real or personal property of the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including a levy against personal property, but not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes: in the alternative, after three (3) months from the filing of any such lien remains unpaid, the city may foreclose or otherwise execute on the lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this section may be foreclosed on real property that is homestead under Section 4, Article X of the State Constitution. In addition to all remedies the city may institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to compel payment of civil penalties. 
(14)  A party may seek a rehearing of the case by filing a written motion for rehearing within ten (10) calendar days of rendition of the decision by the special magistrate. The motion for rehearing shall set forth issues which were overlooked or omitted at the hearing but shall not consist of re-argument of the case. The party filing the motion is responsible for forwarding a copy of the motion to the other party. The city clerk shall immediately forward the motion for rehearing to the special magistrate and within ten (10) days of receipt of the motion, the special magistrate may enter an order on the motion for rehearing or schedule a hearing on the motion. If the motion for rehearing is granted, the case shall be set for rehearing as soon as possible thereafter. 
(15)  All filings shall be made with the city clerk who shall set all hearings and provide all notices as required herein. 
(16)  A party may appeal a decision of a special magistrate by certiorari to the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit within thirty (30) days of the date of the rendition of the decision of the special magistrate as provided by the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure.

(b)  Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following terms shall have meanings indicated (in the event any definition in this section conflicts with the definition in F.S. § 403.703, the definition in F.S. § 403.703 controls): 
    Certified recovered materials dealer means a dealer certified under F.S. § 403.7046. 
    Commercial establishments mean a property or properties zoned or used for commercial or industrial uses, or used by an entity exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and excludes property or properties zoned for single-family residential or multifamily residential uses. 
    Construction and demolition debris means discarded materials generally considered to be not water soluble and nonhazardous in nature, including, but not limited to, steel, glass, brick, concrete, asphalt roofing material, pipe, gypsum wallboard, and lumber, from the construction or destruction of a structure as part of a construction or demolition project or from the renovation of a structure, and including rocks, soils, tree remains, trees, and other vegetative matter that normally results from land clearing or land development operations for a construction project, including such debris from construction of structures at a site remote from the construction or demolition project site. Mixing of construction and demolition debris with other types of solid waste will cause it to be classified as other than construction and demolition debris. The term also includes: 
(1)  Clean cardboard, paper, plastic, wood and metal scraps from a construction project; and 
(2)  Except as provided in Florida Statutes Section 403.707(12)(j), unpainted, nontreated wood scraps from facilities manufacturing materials used for construction of structures or their components and unpainted, nontreated wood pallets provided the wood scraps and pallets are separated from the other solid waste where generated and the generator of such wood scraps or pallets implements reasonable practice of the generating industry to minimize the commingling of wood scraps or pallets with other solid waste; and 
(3)  De minimis amount or other nonhazardous wastes that are generated at construction or destruction projects, provided such amounts are consistent with best management practices of the industry.

    Person means any and all persons, natural or artificial, including any individual, firm or association, partnership, joint venture, or other entity of any kind, type, or description engaging in the conduct or activity with which this section is concerned. 
    Recovered materials means metal, paper, glass, plastic, textile, or rubber materials that have known recycling potential, can be feasibly recycled and have been diverted and source separated or have been removed from the solid waste stream for sale, use or reuse as raw materials, whether or not the materials require subsequent processing or separation from each other, but does not include materials destined for any use that constitutes disposal. Recovered materials as described above are not solid waste. Construction and demolition debris is not a recovered material and therefore shall constitute solid waste. 
    Registrant means a certified recovered materials dealer who has registered with the city in accordance with the requirements of this section. 
    Solid waste management facility means any solid waste disposal area, volume reduction plant, transfer station, materials recovery facility, or other facility, the purpose of which is resource recovery or the disposal, recycling, processing, or storage of solid waste. The term does not include recovered materials processing facilities which meet the requirements of Section 403.7046, [F.S.] except the portion of such facilities, if any, that is used for the management of solid waste. These facilities are prohibited in the city. 
    Source-separated means the recovered materials that are separated from solid waste where the recovered materials and solid waste are generated. The term does not require that various types of recovered materials be separated from each other and recognizes de minimis solid waste, in accordance with industry standards and practices, may be included with recovered materials. Materials are not considered source separated when two (2) or more types of recovered materials are deposited in combination with each other in a commercial collection container located where the materials are generated and such materials contain more than ten (10) percent solid waste by volume or weight. For purposes of this subsection, the term "various types of recovered materials" means metals, paper, glass, plastic, textiles, and rubber.

(Ord. No. 2002-07, § 2, 9-18-2002; Ord. No. 2009-13, § 2, 4-21-2009) 
Sec. 7-51. - Mandatory commercial recycling. 
    It is determined by the city that it is appropriate to require that commercial establishments separate commercial material. The city adopts the findings of the Florida Legislature that the failure and inability to economically recover material and energy resources from solid waste results in the unnecessary waste and depletion of our natural resources and therefore warrants that the maximum resource recovery from solid waste and the maximum recycling and reuse of such resources must be considered a goal of the city, as well as the State of Florida. In order to further these purposes, the city hereby requires that all commercial establishments shall be required to separate recovered materials to make them available for recycling. 
(1)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the definitions as set forth in Section 403.703 of the Florida Statutes shall apply. 
A commercial establishment shall mean any public or private place, building or enterprise devoted in whole or part to a commercial enterprise, whether for profit or not for profit, or any enterprise that is required or does have a city occupational license. This definition shall be deemed to exclude any residents or other operation otherwise excluded by state law. 
(2)  Mandatory recycling. All commercial establishments shall source separate recovered materials at the location where the recovered materials are generated and make said materials available for commercial haulers who are registered with the city, for the purpose of collecting and properly disposing of said recycled materials. The commercial establishment shall be permitted to choose a commercial hauler of its choice, so long as said hauler is registered with the city and properly complies with all state and city regulations. 
(3)  Collection and disposal. Recyclable materials collected pursuant to this section shall transport the collected recyclable materials to a licensed and permitted processing center designated by the hauler. The hauler shall take title to the recyclable materials upon collection from the commercial establishment and shall be responsible for the sale and disposal of such recyclable materials in a manner consistent with state law. The hauler shall insure that all recyclable materials are processed for future use to the extent possible and shall not be disposed of as solid waste. 
Corrugated cardboard shall be segregated from all other solid waste material by all commercial solid waste customers and must be flattened and placed into a recycling dumpster. Material shall be free of food, dirt, grease, tape, or liquid and other contaminants. Wax coated cardboard pizza boxes, shoe boxes, cereal boxes and cake mix boxes are acceptable and shall be placed into the same designated dumpster as corrugated cardboard. Recycling dumpsters for corrugated cardboard and cardboard boxes shall be supplied by the owner of the commercial establishment where the commercial operations are conducted. 
(4)  Containers. All recyclable materials shall be placed in an appropriate industry standard container. Where garbage containers are used, they shall be placed at the location or at such other singular collection point as may be agreed on between the hauler and the customer and in compliance with all city codes and requirements. All containers shall be kept in a safe, accessible, clean location as designated or approved by the city and agreed to by the hauler and the customer. The city may impose reasonable requirements on the location where said containers are placed. If a hauler provides a recyclable materials container to its customers, the hauler will be responsible for the proper maintenance of the container. Customers that acquire their own containers from any other source are responsible for the proper maintenance of the container, except that damage done by the hauler shall be the responsibility of the hauler; and for ensuring that the container can be serviced by the registrant's equipment. 
(5)  Proof of participation. A commercial establishment, generator of recyclable materials or owner of a commercially-collected property shall produce proof of a valid and current contract with a registrant or receipts for delivery of recyclable materials to an approved site, upon request of the city manager or designee.

Footnotes: 
--- (10) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2007-26, § 1, adopted Dec. 5, 2007, amended the former Art. XII, §§ 11-139-11-142, and enacted a new Art. XII as set out herein. Formerly, Ord. No. 2005-15, § 1, adopted July 6, 2005, set out provisions intended for use as § 11-39. For purposes of classification and to preserve the style of this Code, and at the city's instruction, these provisions have been included as Art. XII, §§ 11-139-11-142. It should be noted that Exhibit A referenced in this article is not set out, but is on file and available for inspection in the office of the city clerk. 

Sec. 11-139. - Findings and intent. 
(1)  Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
(2)  It is the intent of this section to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence. 
(Ord. No. 2007-26, § 1, 12-5-2007) 
Sec. 11-140. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Child means a person under the age of sixteen (16) years. 
    Child care facility means day nurseries, family day care homes licensed by the department of children and families. 
    Permanent residence means a place where the person abides, lodges, or resides for fourteen (14) or more consecutive days. 
    Park means a county or municipal park. 
    Playground means an area set aside by a homeowners association of the city for use by minors to play or an area set aside by a governmental agency devoted to active recreational uses for the primary use of preschool or elementary school age children. 
    School means a public or private kindergarten, elementary, middle or secondary (high) school. 
    Sexual offender or sexual predator shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in F.S. § 775.21. 
    Temporary residence means a place where the person abides, lodges, or resides for a period of fourteen (14) or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and which is not the person's permanent address, or a place where the person routinely abides, lodges, or resides for a period of four (4) or more consecutive or nonconsecutive days in any month and which is not the person's permanent residence.

Sec. - 12-3. Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The city commission of the City of Parkland wishes to protect the privacy of residents who do not desire door-to-door solicitation or canvassing as well as the privacy of those residents who wish to receive door-to-door solicitation or canvassing only during certain desired hours. In addition, the city commission wishes to protect and further the rights of residents who may want to receive door-to-door solicitation or canvassing at all times. The city commission is no less cognizant of the First Amendment protections afforded to door-to-door soliciting and canvassing and the concomitant duty of the elected officials to safeguard and protect such First Amendment rights. 
(b)  It is the purpose and intent of the city commission to balance and weigh these sometimes competing concerns in creating this section so as to enact narrowly tailored content and viewpoint neutral regulation which satisfies the city's recognized and significant governmental interests in safeguarding resident privacy by using what is perceived to be very restrictive and minimally intrusive regulatory means in view of the equal adverse impact commercial and noncommercial door-to-door soliciting and canvassing have on resident privacy, all while providing for ample alternative avenues for communication.

    It is hereby ascertained, determined, and declared that: 
(1)  Pursuant to Article VIII, Section 2(b), Florida Constitution, and F.S. §§ 166.021 and 166.041 the city commission has all powers of local self government to perform municipal functions and to render municipal services in a manner not inconsistent with law, and such power may be exercised by the enactment of city ordinances. 
(2)  The city commission may exercise any governmental, corporate, or proprietary power for a municipal purpose except when expressly prohibited by law, and the city commission may legislate on any subject matter on which the Florida Legislature may act, except those subjects described in (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Section 166.021(3), Florida Statutes. The subject matter of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Section 166.021(3), Florida Statutes, are not relevant to the imposition of assessments related to fire rescue services, facilities or programs of the city. 
(3)  The purpose of this article is to (1) provide procedures and standards for the imposition of citywide fire rescue assessments under the general home rule powers of a municipality to impose special assessments; (2) authorize a procedure for the funding of fire rescue services, facilities, or programs providing special benefits to property within the city; and (3) legislatively determine the special benefit provided to assessed property from the provision of the city's fire rescue services.

(Ord. No. 2004-27, § 1.03, 1-11-2005) 
Sec. 19-104. - Legislative determinations of special benefit. 
    It is hereby ascertained and declared that the fire rescue services, facilities, and programs provide a special benefit to property because fire rescue services possess a logical relationship to the use and enjoyment of improved property by: (1) protecting the value and integrity of the improvements and structures through the provision of available fire rescue services; (2) protecting the life and safety of intended occupants in the use and enjoyment of property; (3) lowering the cost of fire insurance by the presence of a professional and comprehensive fire rescue program within the city; and (4) containing the spread of fire incidents occurring on vacant property with the potential to spread and endanger the structures and occupants of improved property.

(c)  All written objections to the final assessment resolution shall be filed with the city manager at or before the time or adjourned time of such hearing. The final assessment resolution shall constitute the annual rate resolution for the initial fiscal year in which fire rescue assessments are imposed or reimposed hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 2004-27, § 2.06, 1-11-2005) 
Sec. 19-207. - Effect of final assessment resolution. 
    The fire rescue assessments for the initial fiscal year shall be established upon adoption of the final assessment resolution. The adoption of the final assessment resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented (including, but not limited to, the determination of special benefit and fair apportionment to the assessed property; the method of apportionment and assessment; the initial rate of assessment; the maximum assessment rate, if any; the initial assessment roll; and the levy and lien of the fire rescue assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within twenty (20) days from the date of the city commission action on the final assessment resolution. The initial assessment roll, as approved by the final assessment resolution, shall be delivered to the tax collector, as required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, or if the alternative method described in section 19-302 hereof is used to collect the fire rescue assessments, such other official as the city commission by resolution shall designate. 
(Ord. No. 2004-27, § 2.07, 1-11-2005) 
Sec. 19-208. - Adoption of annual rate resolution. 
(a)  The city commission shall adopt an annual rate resolution during its budget adoption process for each fiscal year following the initial fiscal year for which a fire rescue assessment is imposed hereunder. 
(b)  The initial proceedings for the adoption of an annual rate resolution shall be the adoption of a preliminary rate resolution by the city commission (1) containing a brief and general description of the fire rescue services, facilities, or programs to be provided; (2) determining the fire rescue assessed cost to be assessed for the upcoming fiscal year; (3) establishing the estimated assessment rate for the upcoming fiscal year; (4) establishing or increasing a maximum assessment rate, if desired by the city commission; (5) authorizing the date, time, and place of a public hearing to receive and consider comments from the public and consider the adoption of the annual rate resolution for the upcoming fiscal year; and (6) directing the city manager to (a) update the assessment roll, (b) provide notice by publication and first class mail to affected owners in the event circumstances described in subsection (f) of this section so require, and (c) directing and authorizing any supplemental or additional notice deemed proper, necessary or convenient by the city. 
(c)  The annual rate resolution shall (1) establish the rate of assessment to be imposed in the upcoming fiscal year and (2) approve the assessment roll for the upcoming fiscal year with such adjustments as the city commission deems just and right. The assessment roll shall be prepared in accordance with the method of apportionment set forth in the initial assessment resolution, or any subsequent preliminary rate resolution, together with modifications, if any, that are provided and confirmed in the final assessment resolution or any subsequent annual rate resolution. 
(d)  Nothing herein shall preclude the city commission from providing annual notification to all owners of assessed property in the manner provided in sections 19-204 and 19-205 hereof or any other method as provided by law. 
(e)  The city commission may establish or increase a maximum assessment rate in an initial assessment resolution or preliminary rate resolution and confirm such maximum assessment rate in the event notice of such maximum rate assessment has been included in the notices required by sections 19-204 and 19-205 hereof. 
(f)  In the event (1) the proposed fire rescue assessment for any fiscal year exceeds the rates of assessment adopted by the city commission including a maximum assessment rate, if any, that were listed in the notices previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to sections 19-204 and 19-205 hereof, (2) the purpose for which the fire rescue assessment is imposed or the use of the revenue from the fire rescue assessment is substantially changed from that represented by notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to sections 19-204 and 19-205 hereof, (3) assessed property is reclassified or the method of apportionment is revised or altered resulting in an increased fire rescue assessment from that represented by notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to sections 19-204 and 19-205 hereof, or (4) an assessment roll contains assessed property that was not included on the assessment roll approved for the prior fiscal year, notice shall be provided by publication and first class mail to the owners of such assessed property as provided by law. Such notice shall substantially conform with the notice requirements set forth in sections 19-204 and 19-205 hereof and inform the owner of the date, time, and place for the adoption of the annual rate resolution. The failure of the owner to receive such notice due to mistake or inadvertence, shall not affect the validity of the assessment roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of a fire rescue assessment imposed by the city commission pursuant to this article. 
(g)  As to any assessed property not included on an assessment roll approved by the adoption of the final assessment resolution or a prior year's annual rate resolution, the adoption of the succeeding annual rate resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented as to such assessed property (including, but not limited to, the determination of special benefit and fair apportionment to the assessed property, the method of apportionment and assessment, the rate of assessment, the establishment or increase of a maximum assessment rate, the assessment roll, and the levy and lien of the fire rescue assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within twenty (20) days from the date of the city commission action on the annual rate resolution. Nothing contained herein shall be construed or interpreted to affect the finality of any fire rescue assessment not challenged within the required twenty-day period for those fire rescue assessments previously imposed against assessed property by the inclusion of the assessed property on an assessment roll approved in the final assessment resolution or any subsequent annual rate resolution. 
(h)  The assessment roll, as approved by the annual rate resolution, shall be delivered to the tax collector as required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, or if the alternative method described in section 19-302 hereof is used to collect the fire rescue assessments, such other official as the city commission by resolution shall designate. If the fire rescue assessment against any property shall be sustained, reduced, or abated by the court, an adjustment shall be made on the assessment roll. 
(Ord. No. 2004-27, § 2.08, 1-11-2005) 
Sec. 19-209. - Lien of fire rescue assessments. 
    Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all fire rescue assessments shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims, until paid. The lien for a fire rescue assessment shall be deemed perfected upon the city commission's adoption of the final assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable. The lien for a fire rescue assessment collected under the uniform assessment collection act shall attach to the property included on the assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes imposed under the tax roll. The lien for a fire rescue assessment collected under the alternative method of collection provided in section 19-302 shall be deemed perfected upon the city commission's adoption of the final assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable, and shall attach to the property on such date of adoption. 
(Ord. No. 2004-27, § 2.09, 1-11-2005) 
Sec. 19-210. - Revisions to fire rescue assessments. 
    If any fire rescue assessment made under the provisions of this article is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the city commission is satisfied that any such fire rescue assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the city commission has failed to include or omitted any property on the assessment roll, which property should have been so included, the city commission may take all necessary steps to impose a new fire rescue assessment against any property benefited by the fire rescue assessed costs, following as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of this article and in case such second fire rescue assessment is annulled, vacated, or set aside, the city commission may obtain and impose other fire rescue assessments until a valid fire rescue assessment is imposed. 
(Ord. No. 2004-27, § 2.10, 1-11-2005) 
Sec. 19-211. - Procedural irregularities. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any fire rescue assessment under the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any fire rescue assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such fire rescue assessment was duly levied, that the fire rescue assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such fire rescue assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this article; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. 
(Ord. No. 2004-27, § 2.11, 1-11-2005) 
Sec. 19-212. - Correction of errors and omissions. 
(a)  No act of error or omission on the part of the property appraiser, tax collector, city manager, city commission, or their deputies or employees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of a fire rescue assessment imposed by the city commission under the provision of this article. 
(b)  When it shall appear that any fire rescue assessment should have been imposed under this article against a parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of fire rescue services, facilities, or programs, but that such property was omitted from the assessment roll; or such property was erroneously assessed; or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual parcel of property as of the effective date of the assessment roll approved by the annual rate resolution for any upcoming fiscal year, the city commission may, upon provision of a notice by mail provided to the owner of the omitted or erroneously assessed parcel in the manner and form provided in section 19-205, impose the applicable fire rescue assessment for the fiscal year in which such error or omission is discovered, in addition to the applicable fire rescue assessment due for the prior two (2) fiscal years. Such fire rescue assessment shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims in and to or against the real property involved, shall be collected as provided in division 3 hereof, and shall be deemed perfected on the date of adoption of the resolution imposing the omitted or delinquent assessments. 
(c)  Prior to the delivery of the assessment roll to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city manager shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property subject to a fire rescue assessment, to reclassify property based upon presentation of competent and substantial evidence, and correct any error in applying the fire rescue assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring the provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any such correction shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the fire rescue assessment imposed under the provisions of this article. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the city manager and not the property appraiser or tax collector. 
(d)  After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the tax roll upon timely written request and direction of the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 2004-27, § 2.12, 1-11-2005) 
Sec. 19-213. - Interim assessments. 
(a)  An interim fire rescue assessment shall be imposed against all property for which a certificate of occupancy (or building permit, as determined by the city commission) is issued after the adoption of the annual rate resolution. The amount of the interim fire rescue assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the annual rate for such property computed in accordance with the annual rate resolution for the fiscal year for which the interim fire rescue assessment is being imposed. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the fiscal year. A credit shall be granted against the interim fire rescue assessment for any fire rescue assessment paid for the same property for the same time period. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim fire rescue assessment shall also include an estimate of the subsequent fiscal year's fire rescue assessment. Issuance of the certificate of occupancy (or building permit, as determined by the city commission) by mistake or inadvertence, and without the payment in full of the interim fire rescue assessment shall not relieve the owner of such property of the obligation of full payment. Any interim fire rescue assessment not collected prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy (or building permit, as determined by the city commission) may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act as provided in section 19-301 of this article, under the alternative collection method provided in section 19-302 or by any other method authorized by law. Any interim fire rescue assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the certificate of occupancy (or building permit, as determined by the city commission) was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved and shall be deemed perfected upon the issuance of the certificate of occupancy (or building permit, as determined by the city commission). 
(b)  In the event the city commission chooses to collect the interim fire rescue assessment at the time a building permit is issued, the following procedure shall apply: 
(1)  In the event a building permit expires prior to completion of the building for which it was issued, and the applicant paid the interim fire rescue assessment at the time the building permit was issued, the applicant may within ninety (90) days of the expiration of the building permit apply for a refund of the interim fire rescue assessment. Failure to timely apply for a refund of the interim fire rescue assessment shall waive any right to a refund. 
(2)  The application for refund shall be filed with the city manager and contain the following: 
a.  The name and address of the applicant; 
b.  The location of the property and the tax parcel identification number for the property which was the subject of the building permit; 
c.  The date the interim fire rescue assessment was paid; 
d.  A copy of the receipt of payment for the fire rescue assessment; and 
e.  The date the building permit was issued and the date of expiration. 
(3)  After verifying that the building permit has expired and that the building has not been completed, the city manager shall refund the interim fire rescue assessment paid for such building. 
(4)  A building permit which is subsequently issued for a building on the same property which was the subject of a refund shall pay the interim fire rescue assessment as required by this section 19-213.

DIVISION 3. - COLLECTION AND USE OF FIRE RESCUE ASSESSMENTS 

Sec. 19-301. - Method of collection. 
(a)  Unless otherwise directed by the city commission, the fire rescue assessments shall be collected pursuant to the uniform method provided in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and the city shall comply with all applicable provisions of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any hearing or notice required by this article may be combined with any other hearing or notice required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act or other provision of law. 
(b)  The amount of a fire rescue assessment to be collected using the uniform method pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act for any specific parcel of benefitted property may include an amount equivalent to the payment delinquency, delinquency fees and recording costs for a prior year's assessment for a comparable service, facility, or program provided, (1) the collection method used in connection with the prior year's assessment did not employ the use of the uniform method of collection authorized by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, (2) notice is provided to the owner as required under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and (3) any lien on the affected parcel for the prior year's assessment is supplanted and transferred to such fire rescue assessment upon certification of a non-ad valorem roll to the tax collector by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2004-27, § 3.01, 1-11-2005) 
Sec. 19-302. - Alternative method of collection. 
    In lieu of using the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city commission may elect to collect the fire rescue assessments by any other method which is authorized by law or under the alternative collection method provided by this section: 
(1)  The city commission shall provide fire rescue assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of property that is subject to the fire rescue assessment. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include (1) a brief explanation of the fire rescue assessment, (2) a description of the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of the fire rescue assessment, (3) the number of units contained within the parcel, (4) the total amount of the fire rescue assessment imposed against the parcel for the appropriate period, (5) the location at which payment will be accepted, (6) the date on which the fire rescue assessment is due, and (7) a statement that the fire rescue assessment constitutes a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. 
(2)  A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the fire rescue assessments shall be recorded in the official records of the city. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that individual liens or releases be filed in the official records. 
(3)  The city commission shall have the right to foreclose and collect all delinquent fire rescue assessments in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property or appoint or retain an agent to institute such foreclosure and collection proceedings. A fire rescue assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within thirty (30) days from the date payment was due, as identified in accordance with subsection (1)(6) of this section. The city commission or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of his or her fire rescue assessment within sixty (60) days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the city commission or its agent will either (1) initiate a foreclosure action or suit in equity and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent fire rescue assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real property, or (2) cause an amount equivalent to the delinquent fire rescue assessment, not previously subject to collection using the uniform method under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, to be collected on the tax bill for a subsequent year. 
(4)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the city may be the purchaser to the same extent as any person. The city commission or its agent may join in one foreclosure action the collection of fire rescue assessments against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city commission and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and any other costs incurred by the city commission as a result of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(5)  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent fire rescue assessment and the costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that (1) notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and this article, and (2) any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent fire rescue assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the assessment roll, as applicable, to the tax collector. 
(6)  Notwithstanding the city commission's use of an alternative method of collection, the city manager shall have the same power and authority to correct errors and omissions as provided to him or other city officials in section 19-212 hereof. 
(7)  Any city commission action required in the collection of fire rescue assessments may be by resolution. 
(Ord. No. 2004-27, § 3.02, 1-11-2005) 
Sec. 19-303. - Government property. 
(a)  In the event fire rescue assessments are imposed against government property, the city commission shall provide fire rescue assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of government property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include (1) a brief explanation of the fire rescue assessment, (2) a description of the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of the fire rescue assessment, (3) the number of units contained within the parcel, (4) the total amount of the parcel's fire rescue assessment for the appropriate period, (5) the location at which payment will be accepted, and (6) the date on which the fire rescue assessment is due. 
(b)  Fire rescue assessments imposed against government property shall be due on the same date as all other fire rescue assessments and, if applicable, shall be subject to the same discounts for early payment. 
(c)  A fire rescue assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within thirty (30) days from the date payment was due, as identified in subsection (a)(6) of this section. The city commission shall notify the owner of any government property that is delinquent in payment of its fire rescue assessment within sixty (60) days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state that the city commission will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel payment. 
(d)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and any other costs incurred by the city commission as a result of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(e)  As an alternative to the foregoing, a fire rescue assessment imposed against government property may be collected as a surcharge on a utility bill provided to such government property in periodic installments with a remedy of a mandamus action in the event of nonpayment. The city commission may contract for such billing services with any utility, whether or not such utility is owned by the city.

Pounds on All Axles 4 ..... 40,000 5 ..... 40,000 6 ..... 40,000 7 ..... 40,000 8 ..... 40,000 9 ..... 44,140 10 ..... 44,980 11 ..... 45,810 12 ..... 46,640 13 ..... 47,480 14 ..... 48,310 15 ..... 49,150 16 ..... 49,980 17 ..... 50,810 18 ..... 51,640 19 ..... 52,480 20 ..... 53,310 21 ..... 54,140 22 ..... 54,980 23 ..... 55,810 24 ..... 56,640 25 ..... 57,470 26 ..... 58,310 27 ..... 59,140 28 ..... 59,970 29 ..... 60,810 30 ..... 61,640 31 ..... 62,470 32 ..... 63,310 33 ..... 64,140 34 ..... 64,970 35 ..... 65,800 36 ..... 66,610  
(d)  With respect to those highways not in the Interstate Highway System, in all cases in which it exceeds state law in effect on January 4, 1975, the overall gross weight on the vehicle or combination of vehicles, including all enforcement tolerances, shall be as determined by the following formula: 
W = 500 ((LN ° (N - 1)) + 12N + 36) 
where: 
W = Overall gross weight of the vehicle to the nearest five hundred (500) pounds; 
L = Distance in feet between the extreme of the external axles; and 
N = Number of axles on the vehicle. 
However, such overall gross weight of any vehicle or combination of vehicles may not exceed eighty thousand (80,000) pounds including all enforcement tolerances. 
(e)  Dump trucks, concrete mixing trucks, fire trucks and other emergency vehicles engaged in waste collection and disposal, and fuel oil and gasoline trucks designed and constructed for special type work or use, when operated as a single unit, shall be subject to all safety and operational requirements of law, except that any such vehicle need not conform to the axle spacing requirements of this section provided that such vehicle shall be limited to a total gross load, including the weight of the vehicle, of twenty thousand (20,000) pounds per axle plus scale tolerances and shall not exceed five hundred fifty (550) pounds per inch width tire surface plus scale tolerances.

(Ord. No. 2006-09, § 1, 4-19-2006; Ord. No. 2009-21, § 2, 6-3-2009) 
Sec. 20-26. - Weight and load unlawful; special fuel and motor fuel tax enforcement; inspection; penalty; review. 
(a)  Any designated law enforcement of the city or of the department of transportation having reason to believe that the weight of the vehicle and load is unlawful is authorized to require the driver to stop and submit to a weighing of the same by means of either portable or fixed scales and may require that such vehicle be driven to the nearest weigh station or public scales, provided such a facility is within five (5) miles. Anyone who refuses to submit to such weighing, in addition to any criminal penalties that may be imposed pursuant to Florida Statutes, shall be guilty of a violation of this section which shall be punishable pursuant to section 1-11 of the city Code. 
(b)  (1)  Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle or combination of vehicles with load, determines that the axle weight or gross weight is unlawful, the officer may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing until a determination can be made as to the amount of weight thereon and, if overloaded, the amount of penalty to be assessed as provided herein. However, any gross weight over and beyond six thousand (6,000) pounds beyond the maximum herein set shall be unloaded and all material so unloaded shall be cared for by the owner or operator of the vehicle at the risk of such owner or operator. Except as otherwise provided in this article, to facilitate compliance with and enforcement of the weight limits established in section 20-25 of this article, weight tables published pursuant to this article shall include a ten (10) percent scale tolerance and shall thereby reflect the maximum scaled weights allowed any vehicle or combination of vehicles. As used in this section, scale tolerance means the allowable deviation from legal weights established in section 20-25. Notwithstanding any other provision of the weight law, if a vehicle or combination of vehicles does not exceed the gross, external bridge, or internal bridge weight limits imposed in section 20-25 and the driver of such vehicle or combination of vehicles can comply with the requirements of this article by shifting or equalizing the load on all wheels or axles and does so when requested by the proper authority, the driver shall not be held to be operating in violation of said weight limits. 
(2)  The officer shall inspect the license plate or registration certificate of the commercial vehicle, as defined in Section 316.003(66), Florida Statutes, to determine if its gross weight is in compliance with the declared gross vehicle weight. If its gross weight exceeds the declared weight, the penalty shall be five cents ($0.05) per pound on the difference between such weights. In those cases when the commercial vehicle, as defined in Section 316.003(66), Florida Statutes, is being operated over the streets, roadways or highways of the city with an expired registration or with no registration from this or any other jurisdiction or is not registered under the applicable provisions of Chapter 320, Florida Statutes, the penalty herein shall apply on the basis of five cents ($0.05) per pound on that scaled weight which exceeds thirty five thousand (35,000) pounds on laden truck tractor-semi trailer combinations or tandem trailer truck combinations, ten thousand (10,000) pounds on laden straight trucks or straight truck-trailer combinations, or ten thousand (10,000) pounds on any unladen commercial motor vehicle. If the license plate or registration has not been expired for more than ninety (90) days, the penalty imposed under this paragraph may not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). In the case of special mobile equipment, as defined in Section 316.003(48), Florida Statutes, which qualifies for the license tax provided for in Section 320.08(5)(b), Florida Statutes, being operated on the highways of the state with an expired registration or otherwise not properly registered under the applicable provisions of Chapter 320, Florida Statutes, a penalty of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) shall apply in addition to any other penalty which may apply in accordance with this article. A vehicle found in violation of this section may be detained until the owner or operator produces evidence that the vehicle has been properly registered. Any costs incurred by the retention of the vehicle shall be the sole responsibility of the owner. A person who has been assessed a penalty pursuant to this paragraph for failure to have a valid vehicle registration certificate pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 320, Florida Statutes, is not subject to the delinquent fee authorized in Section 320.07, Florida Statutes, if such person obtains a valid registration certificate within ten (10) working days after such penalty was assessed. 
(c)  Weight limits established and posted for a road or bridge pursuant to subsection 20-27(b) or Section 316.555, Florida Statutes, and weight limits specified in special permits issued pursuant to subsection 20-27(a) or Section 316.550, Florida Statutes, shall be deemed to include all allowable tolerances. In those cases when a vehicle or combination of vehicles exceeds the weight limits established and posted for a road or bridge pursuant to section 20-27 or Section 316.555, Florida Statutes, or exceeds the weight limits permitted in a special permit issued pursuant to section 20-27 or Section 316.550, Florida Statutes, the penalty shall be five cents ($.05) per pound on the difference between the scale weight of the vehicle and the weight limits for such posted road or bridge or permitted in such special permit. However, if a special permit is declared invalid in accordance with rules promulgated pursuant to this article or Section 316.550, Florida Statutes, the penalties imposed in subsection (d) below shall apply to those weights which exceed the limits established in section 20-25. 
(d)  Any person who violates the overloading provisions of this chapter shall be presumed to have damaged the streets, roadways or highways of this city by reason of such overloading, which damage is hereby fixed (and shall constitute a fine) as follows: 
(1)  When the excess weight is two hundred (200) pounds or less than the maximum herein provided, the penalty shall be ten dollars ($10.00); 
(2)  Five cents ($0.05) per pound for each pound of weight in excess of the maximum herein provided when the excess weight exceeds two hundred (200) pounds. However, whenever the gross weight of the vehicle or combination of vehicles does not exceed the maximum allowable gross weight, the maximum fine for the first six hundred (600) pounds of unlawful axle weight shall be ten dollars ($10.00); 
(3)  An apportioned motor vehicle, as defined in Section 320.01, Florida Statutes, operating on the streets, roadways or highways of this city without being properly licensed and registered shall be subject to the penalties as herein provided; 
(4)  Vehicles operating on the streets, roadways, or highways of this city from nonmember International Registration Plan jurisdictions which are not in compliance with the provisions of Section 316.605, Florida Statutes, shall be subject to the penalties as herein provided. 
(e)  (1)  No commercial vehicle, as defined in Section 316.003(66), Florida Statutes, shall be operated over the streets, roadways, or highways of this city unless it has been properly registered under the provisions of Section 207.004, Florida Statutes. Whenever any law enforcement officer identified in Section 207.023(1), or any traffic enforcement officer as defined in Section 318.141, Florida Statutes, upon inspecting the vehicle or combination of vehicles, determines that the vehicle is in violation of Section 207.004, Florida Statutes, a penalty in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be assessed, and the vehicle shall be detained until payment is collected by the law enforcement officer. 
(2)  In addition to the penalty provided for in subsection (1), the vehicle may be detained until the owner or operator of the vehicle furnishes evidence that the vehicle has been properly registered pursuant to Section 207.004, Florida Statutes. Any officer or agent of the department of transportation may issue an emergency or trip permit and collect the appropriate fee as provided for in Section 207.004(4), Florida Statutes. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (6), all permit fees collected pursuant to this paragraph shall be transferred to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to be allocated pursuant to Section 207.026, Florida Statutes. 
(3)  Any person aggrieved by the imposition of penalties pursuant to this subsection may apply to the review board, as provided for in section 20-26 (k) of this article, for modification, cancellation, or revocation of the penalty and the review board is authorized to modify, cancel, revoke or sustain such penalty. 
(f)  In addition to the right to prosecute violations in county court, whenever any person violates the provisions of this chapter and becomes indebted to the city because of such violation in the amounts aforesaid and refuses to pay said penalty, such penalty shall become a lien upon the motor vehicle, and the same may be foreclosed by the city in a court of equity. It shall be presumed that the owner of the motor vehicle is liable for the sum. Any person, firm, or corporation claiming an interest in the seized motor vehicle may, at any time after the lien of the city attaches to the motor vehicle, obtain possession of the seized vehicle by filing a good and sufficient forthcoming bond with the officer having possession of the vehicle, payable to the City of Parkland in twice the amount of the city's lien, with a corporate surety duly authorized to transact business in the State of Florida as surety, conditioned to have the motor vehicle or combination of vehicles forthcoming to abide the result of any suit for the foreclosure of such lien. It shall be presumed that the owner of the motor vehicle is liable for the penalty imposed under this section. Upon the posting of such bond with the officer making the seizure, the vehicle shall be released and the bond shall be forwarded to the City of Parkland for safekeeping. The lien of the city against the motor vehicle aforesaid shall be foreclosure in equity, and the ordinary rules of court relative to proceedings in equity shall control. If it appears that the seized vehicle has been released to the defendant upon his forthcoming bond, the city shall take judgment of foreclosure against the property itself, and judgment against the defendant and the sureties on the bond for the amount of the lien, including cost of proceedings after the rendition of the decree, the city may, at its option, proceed to sue out execution against the defendant and his sureties for the amount recovered as aforesaid or direct the sale of the vehicle under foreclosure. 
(g)  Any officer or agent collecting the penalties herein imposed shall give to the owner or driver of the vehicle an official receipt for all penalties collected. Such officers or agents shall cooperate with the owners or drivers of motor vehicles so as not to delay unduly the vehicles. 
(h)  Pursuant to Sections 316.302 and 316.545, Florida Statutes, penalties and fees are due and payable at the time of issuance and shall be remitted to the officer or traffic enforcement officer of the Parkland Police Department (Broward Sheriff's Office) who assessed the penalty. Payment shall be made for the exact amount of the assessment in cash, money order, or cashier's check and shall be made payable to the City of Parkland. 
(i)  All penalties and fines collected pursuant to this chapter shall be placed in a separate commercial vehicle account. This account shall be created solely for the collection of penalties and fines resulting from violations of this chapter. 
(j)  The city shall create a commercial motor vehicle review board consisting of three (3) members who shall be the police traffic supervisor or designee, the city manager or designee, and a community representative chosen by the police traffic supervisor and the city manager. The review board may review any penalty imposed upon any vehicle or person under the provisions of this chapter relating to weights imposed on the streets, roadways, or highways by the axles and wheels of motor vehicles, to special fuel and motor fuel tax compliance, or to violations of safety regulations. 
(1)  The police traffic supervisor or authorized representative shall be the chairman of the review board. 
(2)  The chairman of the review board is responsible for the administrative functions of the review board. 
(k)  Any person aggrieved by the imposition of a civil penalty pursuant to this section or Section 316.3025, Florida Statutes, may apply to the commercial motor vehicle review board for a modification, cancellation, or revocation of the penalty; and the review board is authorized to modify, cancel, revoke, or sustain such penalty.

Sec. 20-27. - Special permits. 
(a)  The city, with respect to streets, roadways, or highways under its jurisdiction may, in its discretion and upon application and good cause shown therefore that the same is not contrary to the public interest, issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight exceeding the maximum specified in this chapter, or otherwise not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, upon any street, roadway, or highway under the jurisdiction of the city and for the maintenance of which the city is responsible. The permit shall describe the vehicles or vehicles and the load to be operated or moved and the streets, roadways or highways for which the permit is requested. The city is authorized to issue or withhold such permit at its discretion or if such permit is issued, to limit or prescribe the conditions of operation of such vehicle or vehicles. The city is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations concerning the issuance of such permits and to charge a fee for the issuance thereof, which rules, regulations, and fees shall have the force and effect of law. Every such permit shall be carried in the vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection by any police officer or other authorized agent of Parkland. 
(b)  The city may prescribe, by notice hereinafter provided for, loads and weights lower than the limits prescribed in this chapter and other laws, whenever in its or their judgment any road or part thereof or any bridge or culvert shall, by reason of its design, deterioration, rain, or other climatic or natural causes be liable to be damaged or destroyed by motor vehicles, trailers, or semi trailers, if the gross weight shall exceed the limits prescribed in said notice. Parkland may limit, in whole or in part, the operation of any specified class or size of motor vehicles, trailers, or semi trailers on any streets, roadways or highways or specified parts thereof under its jurisdiction, whenever it is in their judgment, such regulation is necessary to provide for the public safety and convenience on the streets, roadways or highways, or parts therefore, by reason of traffic density, intensive use thereof by the traveling public, or other reasons of public safety and convenience. The notice or substance thereof shall be posted at conspicuous places at terminals of intermediate crossroads and road injunctions with the section of street, roadway or highway to which the notice shall apply. After any such notice has been posted, the operation of any motor vehicle or combination contrary to its provisions shall constitute a violation of this chapter.

c)  Such rules and regulations shall recognize that FPL's above-grade Facilities installed after the effective date hereof should be installed near the outer boundaries of the Public Right-Of-Way to the extent possible. 
d)  When any portion of a Public Right-Of-Way is excavated, damaged, or impaired by FPL (or any of FPL's agents, contractors, or subcontractors) because of the installation, inspection, or repair of any of FPL's Facilities, the portion of the Public Right-Of-Way so excavated, damaged, or impaired shall, within a reasonable time after such excavation, damage, or impairment, be restored by FPL at its expense to a condition at least equal to its original condition before such damage.

Subject to all limitations, terms and conditions specified in the preceding sentence, the City shall have the sole discretion to determine the percentage to be used in calculating monthly payments, and FPL shall have the sole discretion to determine those benefits to which it would be entitled, under any such Franchise Agreement. 
Section 7. - Non-Competition by City. 
    As a further consideration, during the term of this franchise or any extension thereof, the City agrees: (a) not to engage in the distribution and/or sale, in competition with FPL, of electric capacity and/or electric energy to any ultimate consumer of electric utility service (herein called a "retail customer" or to any electrical distribution system established solely to serve any retail customer presently served by FPL within the City's limits; and (b) not to participate in any proceeding or contractual arrangement, the purpose or terms of which would be to obligate FPL to transmit and/or distribute, electric capacity and/or electric energy from any third party(ies) to any other retail customers facility(ies). Nothing specified herein shall prohibit the City from engaging with other utilities or persons in wholesale transactions which are subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act, as may be amended from time to time. 
    The City may, if permitted by law, (i) generate electric capacity and/or energy at any facility owned or leased by the City for storage or utilization at that facility or other City owned or leased facilities as chosen by the City, and (ii) use renewable energy sources to generate electric capacity and/or energy for use in demonstration projects or at City facilities, including but not limited to, City Hall, and (iii) sell electric capacity and/or energy to FPL or other wholesale purchasers in compliance with applicable tariffs, and/or federal or state laws, rules and regulations controlling such transactions. The term "retail customer," for purposes of this section shall not include the City itself. 
    Nothing herein shall prohibit the City, if permitted by law, (i) from purchasing electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other person, or (ii) from seeking to have FPL transmit and/or distribute to any facility(ies) of the City electric capacity and/or electric energy purchased by the City from any other person; provided, however, that before the City elects to purchase electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other person, the City shall notify FPL. Such notice shall include a summary of the specific rates, terms and conditions which have been offered by the other person and identify the City's facilities to be served under the offer. FPL shall thereafter have 90 days to evaluate the offer and, if FPL offers rates, terms and conditions which are equal to or better than those offered by the other person, the City shall be obligated to continue to purchase from FPL electric capacity and/or electric energy to serve the previously identified facilities of the City for a term no shorter than that offered by the other person. If FPL does not agree to rates, terms and conditions which are equal to or better than the other person's offer, all of the remaining terms and conditions of this Franchise shall remain in effect. 
Section 8. - Competitive Disadvantage; FPL's Right. 
    If the City grants a right, privilege or franchise to any other person to construct, operate or maintain electric light and power facilities within any part of the City's boundaries in which FPL may lawfully serve or compete on terms and conditions which FPL reasonably determines are more favorable than the terms and conditions contained herein, FPL may at any time thereafter terminate this Franchise if such terms and conditions are not remedied within the time period provided hereafter. FPL shall give the City at least one hundred eighty (180) days advance written notice of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the right reserved for FPL herein, advise the City of such terms and conditions that it considers more favorable and the objective basis or bases of the claimed competitive disadvantage. The City shall then have ninety (90) days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the terms and conditions complained of by FPL, and the City and FPL agree to negotiate in good faith toward a mutually acceptable resolution of FPL's claims during this 90-day period. If FPL reasonably determines that such terms or conditions are not remedied by the City within said time period, and if no mutually acceptable resolution is reached by FPL and the City through negotiation, FPL may terminate this Franchise agreement by delivering written notice to the City's Clerk, City's Manager, and City's Attorney, and termination shall be effective ninety (90) days from the date of delivery of such notice. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as constraining the City's right to legally challenge at any time FPL's determination leading to termination under this Section. 
Section 9. - Legislative or Regulatory Action. 
    If as a consequence of any legislative, regulatory or other action by the United States of America or the State of Florida (or any department, agency, authority, instrumentality or political subdivision of either of them) any person is permitted to provide electric service within the City's boundaries to a customer then being served by FPL, or to any new applicant for electric service within any part of the City's boundaries in which FPL may lawfully serve, and FPL reasonably determines that its obligations hereunder, or otherwise resulting from this Franchise in respect to rates and service, place it at a material competitive disadvantage with respect to such other person, FPL may, at any time after the taking of such action, terminate this Franchise if such competitive disadvantage is not remedied as provided hereafter. Such competitive disadvantage can be remedied by either of the following methods: (i) if the City either cannot legally, or does not, charge a franchise fee to other electricity supplier(s), then the City can remedy the disadvantage by reducing FPL's franchise fee rate to zero; or (ii) if the City is able to charge, and does charge, such other electricity supplier(s) a franchise fee at a rate less than the 6.0% rate calculated as provided in Section 6 of this Agreement, then the City can remedy the disadvantage by reducing FPL's franchise fee rate to the same rate, with the same applicability and calculation methodology, as applies to such other electricity supplier(s). If the City does not implement either of the foregoing solutions, FPL may terminate the Agreement, in accordance with the following process: FPL shall give the City at least one hundred eighty (180) days advance written notice of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the right reserved for FPL herein, advise the City of the consequences of such action which resulted in the competitive disadvantage and the objective basis or bases of the claimed competitive disadvantage, and the City and FPL agree to negotiate in good faith toward a mutually acceptable resolution of FPL's claimed disadvantage during this 180-day period. If such competitive disadvantage is, in the reasonable determination of FPL, not remedied by the City within said time period, and if no mutually acceptable resolution of the matter is reached through negotiation, FPL may terminate this franchise agreement by delivering written notice to the City's Clerk and termination shall take effect ninety (90) days from the date of delivery of such notice. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as constraining the City's right to legally challenge at any time FPL's determination of competitive disadvantage leading to termination under this Section. 
Section 10. - FPL's Failure to Comply. 
    Failure on the part of FPL to comply in any material respect with any of the provisions of this Franchise shall be grounds for forfeiture, but no such forfeiture shall take effect if the reasonableness or propriety thereof is protested by FPL until there is final determination (after the expiration or exhaustion of all right of appeal) by a court of competent jurisdiction within Broward County, Florida that FPL has failed to comply in a material respect with any of the provisions of this Franchise, and FPL shall have six (6) months after such final determination to make good the default before a forfeiture shall result, with the right of the City, at its discretion, to grant such additional time to FPL for compliance as necessities in the case require.

10.1.1. Beginning October 1, 2010, the curbside Single-family residence and Duplex residence rates as stated in Exhibit A shall decrease by twenty cents ($0.20) per month. Concurrently on October 1, 2011 and yearly thereafter, the curbside residential rates shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect the cost of doing business measured by the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), as published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor agency for all urban consumers in the Miami/Fort Lauderdale district, for the latest available twelve (12) months calculated by utilizing the CPI for the month of December for the appropriate years. Any such adjustment shall be plus or minus any applicable eleven percent (11%) franchise fee. Further, the annual rate adjustment reflecting the change in the CPI shall not exceed five (5) percent in any one (1) year exclusive of the franchise fee adjustment. 
10.1.2. The rate for Multi-family residence, Commercial and Optional containerized services as noted on Exhibit A shall be increased by 2% on October 1, 2010, and then adjusted for changes in the CPI using the methodology and indices set forth in Section 10.1.1 above, concurrently, the first CPI adjustment shall occur on April 1, 2010 and yearly thereafter.

10.1.3.

The CITY in its sole discretion may determine whether to grant or deny, in whole or in part, any portion of the requests contained within the petition. Any adjustment granted by CITY affecting Single-family residence and Duplex residence collection rates shall only be implemented in conjunction with the tax roll billing cycle. (See Section 10.3.1) 
10.1.4. The rate may be increased to offset the increased costs of CONTRACTOR as a result of increases in costs of operations resulting from changes in federal, state or local environmental or other law or regulation which changes affect operations on or after the date hereof concerning the receipt, handling, transportation, disposal, taxes, surcharges or assessments of Refuse pursuant to this Agreement so long as CONTRACTOR can demonstrate that said costs are directly and solely attributable to such changes and that CONTRACTOR has sought to minimize the effect of such changes on the cost to provide such services. This subsection, as the same relates to disposal, may not be invoked due to any increase in the costs of operation of the CONTRACTOR or any receiving facility resulting from actions or requirements imposed by a county or municipality. Any adjustment affecting Single-family residence and Duplex residence collection rates shall only be implemented in conjunction with the tax roll billing cycle. (See Section 10.3.1) 
    10.2 Franchise Fees.

Residential - For and in consideration of CONTRACTOR'S right and privilege appertaining hereto, to operate and maintain a trash, garbage and refuse collection and removal service in, upon, over, and across the present and future streets, alleys, bridges, easements, and other public places within the City of Parkland for the purpose of collecting and disposing of the trash, garbage, and other refuse generated by residences, CITY, upon receipt of payment from the Revenue Collector of Broward County, shall retain a franchise fee of eleven percent (11%) of gross revenues collected for Single-family residence and Duplex residence collection and shall pay CONTRACTOR on the 25 th of the month following the month such payment is received. The CITY shall deduct said franchise fees from each payment. 
By way of example and illustration, for residential services, the following would pertain: 
Amount remitted to City by Broward County $100,000 (includes franchise fees) Split out services vs. Franch. Fees ÷ 1.11 (1 plus current Franch. Fee) Amount Due WMIF for services = 90,090 Current Franchise Fee rate × 11.0% Amount retained by City $9910  
For commercial services billed by Contractor: Amount billed and collected by WMIF $100,000 (includes franch. Fees) Split out services vs. Franch. Fees ÷ 1.12 (1 plus current Franch. Fee) Amount due WMIF for services =$89,286 Current Franchise Fee rate × 12.0% Amount paid to City $10,714  
10.2.2. Multi-Family and Commercial - CONTRACTOR shall pay CITY a franchise fee of twelve percent (12%) of gross revenues collected for multi-family and commercial collection (but excluding commercial recycling, compactor leases, repairs and maintenance, and similar activities that are not exclusive to Contractor under this Agreement), to be paid on a monthly basis on the twenty-fifth (25th) day of each month succeeding the month of service. Revenues from commercial recycling and recovered materials are excluded from the franchise fee calculation. 
10.2.3.

    10.3 Billing 
10.3.1 It is recognized by the parties hereto that all single family and duplex residence rate increases or decreases and the collection of rates shall, as of October 1, 2010 and every October 1 st thereafter, be dependent on and subject to the system for collection through the Broward County Tax Collector's Office through the ad valorem tax bill, and any changes to that system. Therefore, no billing increase or decrease for single family and duplex residences shall be effective unless said increase or decrease is adopted and presented to the Broward County Property Appraiser's Office in a manner which permits inclusion of the increase or decease on the ad valorem tax bill; further it is acknowledged and agreed that such increases or decreases must be adopted in conjunction with the ad valorem tax billing cycle of the Broward County Property Appraiser and shall be subject to that billing cycle. CONTRACTOR acknowledges and agrees to provide in writing the residential rate for single family and duplex residences to CITY on or before June 1 st of each calendar year in accordance with Section 10.1.1 above. Failure of CONTRACTOR to provide said number by June 1 st will result in the previous year's rates being charged CITY residents; further any failure by the Property Appraiser's Office to include an increase timely sought by CONTRACTOR shall not be the responsibility of the CITY. However, such failure by the Property Appraiser's Office shall not prejudice or prevent Contractor from recovering all such sums rightfully due it and the City shall assist Contractor and take such steps to facilitate payment of such sums from those residents who owe same. 
    Single family and duplex accounts, whose tax bills do not reflect a non-ad valorem assessment for solid waste and recycling services, for any reason will be charged an annual fee directly by CONTRACTOR which will be pro-rated accordingly, under the proper circumstances. Such properties will be placed on the next year's tax bill as a non-ad valorem assessment. CITY shall have no responsibility for billing or collection of said annual fee; however, CONTRACTOR shall have the responsibility to remit the appropriate franchise fee amounts (all set forth herein) to the CITY monthly pursuant to the Agreement. The CITY shall pay CONTRACTOR all solid waste collection non-ad valorem assessment revenues received from the Tax Collector's Office, less Franchise Fee and any other fees or costs provided for herein provided for in Section 10.2 hereof, by the 25 th of the month following the month such revenues are received. 
    CONTRACTOR recognizes that the use of the special assessment process for collection for single family and duplex residences is an accommodation to CONTRACTOR and that the CITY shall not be responsible for non-collection of any fees, or for the failure to get rate increases or decreases on the tax roll or any payment failures of any kind and that the only responsibility of CITY is to pay assessments collected and paid to CITY by the Tax Collector (less fees and costs set out herein) to CONTRACTOR as collected and to the extent collected according to the schedule set forth herein. CITY shall have no obligation to pay fees on units or properties not on the tax roll or where fees are not collected by the Tax Collector for any reason but shall assist and facilitate Contractor's efforts to collect same as set forth above. Further, if special assessments for single family and duplex residences are challenged or reversed or altered in any way, CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for defending such challenge on behalf of the CITY and shall defend, indemnify and hold the CITY harmless from any costs, including attorneys' fees, refunds, penalties or other liability of any kind emanating therefrom. Contractor shall choose counsel who shall be reasonably be approved by City and shall direct all litigation and settlement. Should any refunds of special assessments for collection of single family and duplex residences be required to any property or unit for any reason whatsoever (excluding the negligent or intentionally wrongful acts of the City) CONTRACTOR shall be fully responsible for said payment. 
10.3.2. Except for single family and duplex residences, who shall be billed through the non-ad valorem tax bill, all other residences or businesses shall be billed monthly by CONTRACTOR at rates in accordance with this Agreement. CONTRACTOR shall assume sole responsibility for billing and collection charges directly from each customer. CONTRACTOR shall bear the exclusive costs in collection of any and all past due amounts owed from customers. CITY shall have no responsibility of any nature whatsoever for imposition or collection of fees on these properties. CONTRACTOR shall remit its FRANCHISE FEE on or before the 25 th of the month following such revenues are received. 
    10.4 Administrative Fees. CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for administrative costs of any kind, which shall include, but not be limited to, all direct costs paid to the Broward County Property Appraiser for processing of the non-ad valorem assessment and 1/2 of the fee charged by the Broward County Tax Collector, including, but not limited to any per parcel or other costs charged to the CITY by any government body, (excluding the cost of CITY staff), educational materials regarding the tax billing/garbage collection process and consultants, including attorneys fees to implement and/or process the annual non-ad valorem assessment. CONTRACTOR agrees that the costs of the assessment process are part of the costs of affecting collection services and, thus, are the responsibility of the CONTRACTOR. CONTRACTOR further agrees that, in consideration of that responsibility, and because the non-ad valorem assessment ultimately results in a benefit to the CONTRACTOR, that the CONTRACTOR shall promptly compensate the CITY for its costs. CONTRACTOR shall provide the CITY initially $20,000 upon execution of this Agreement, which will be placed in an escrow to cover costs outlined in this section. Thereafter, if the escrow falls below $500 then CONTRACTOR shall provide an additional $10,000 to replenish the escrow. CITY shall provide CONTRACTOR invoices of costs charged against the escrow. CONTRACTOR also agrees that all annual costs, excluding the fees charged by governmental agencies, not exceeding $10,000 individually, incurred in annually implementing the non-ad valorem assessment program shall be borne by the CONTRACTOR and paid out of the escrow or if the escrow is exhausted paid promptly by CONTRACTOR. CONTRACTOR shall provide sufficient funds on or before January 1 st each year to maintain $10,000 in the escrow. 
    10.5 Discounts It is understood and agreed that all discounts allowed for early payment of a non-ad valorem assessments as provided by Statute, Ordinance, or otherwise are applicable to the compensation paid to CONTRACTOR for services pursuant to this Agreement and as a result, the CONTRACTOR may receive less compensation than is provided in Appendix A for any changes that are collected on the tax bill in accordance with Section 10.3.1 and Section 197.3632, Florida Statutes.

(1)  The Index number for the U.S. for "All Items" as of January, 1981, shall be the Base Index Number, and the corresponding Index Number shall be an average of the last twelve (12) months of the CPI Index and the resulting average shall be known as the Current Index Number. 
(2)  The Base Index Number shall be subtracted from the Current Index Number. The resulting difference shall be divided by the Base Index Number and the resulting quotient shall be multiplied by 100. Any resulting positive number shall be deemed to be the cumulative percentage of increase in the cost of living. 
(3)  The permissible increase in rates shall be the product of the monthly subscriber fee in effect at the time Ordinance 53 was adopted ($7.95 was the basic monthly subscriber fee for the first outlet; and $2.95 was the basic monthly subscriber fee for each additional outlet) multiplied by the cumulative percentage of increase in the cost of living. Any rate increase made pursuant to this provision shall be immediately filed with the City Clerk together with all supporting data to justify such increase without City approval. In the event the City Commission should determine that such increase may not be justified, a public hearing will be held within forty-five (45) days of the date of filing with the City. The Company shall have the burden of proving to the City's satisfaction the justification for such increase. 
(c)  City approval, in conjunction with public proceedings, is required before any increase in rates, may be initiated for any charges other than in Paragraph (b) above. 
(Ord. No. 53-A, § 1, 11-2-1983)

Each such policy shall be in the minimum sum of $5,000,000.00 for bodily or personal injury or death to any one person, and in the minimum sum of $10,000,000.00 for injury or death to all persons where there is more than one person involved in any one accident, and in the minimum sum of $10,000,000.00 for damage to property, resulting from any one accident, and each of the said minimum sums shall remain in full force and shall be undiminished during the effective period of this Ordinance. The City shall also be named an additional insured on a "Named Peril and Time Element Pollution Endorsement to the General Liability Policy" environmental insurance policy in the minimum amount of $5,000,000.00. 
    Every such insurance policy shall contain a provision whereby every company executing the same shall obligate itself to notify the clerk of the City, in writing, at least thirty (30) days before any material alteration, modification, or cancellation of such policy is to become effective and the City shall be provided copies of policies annually.

    In consideration of the permissions granted to the Company by this Franchise Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City, its officers, agents and employees from and against claims, suits, actions, and causes of action, caused by or arising out of and to the extent of the Company's negligent operation of the Distribution System within the City during the term of this franchise and resulting in personal injury, loss of life or damage to property sustained by any person or entity, through or as a result of the doing of any work herein authorized or the failure to do work herein required, and including all reasonable costs, attorney's fees, expenses and liabilities incurred by the City in connection with any such claim, suit, action or cause of action including the investigation thereof, and the defense of any action or proceeding brought thereon and any order, judgment or decree which may be entered in any such action or proceeding or as a result thereof, except that neither the Company nor any of its employees, agents, contractor, licensees, or sublessees shall be liable under this section for any claims, suits, actions, damages, expenditures, including attorney's fees, or causes of action arising out of injury, loss of life or damage to persons or property caused by or arising out of the negligence, strict liability, intentional torts, criminal acts, or error of the City, its officers, agents, or employees. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to affect in any way the City's rights, privileges, and immunities under the doctrine of "sovereign immunity" and as set forth in Section 768.28, Florida Statutes. The provisions of this section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Franchise Agreement. 
Section 15. - Forfeiture or revocation of grant. 
    Violation by the Company of any of the covenants, terms, and conditions hereof, or default by the Company in observing or carrying into effect any of said covenants, terms and conditions, shall authorize and empower the City to declare a forfeiture of and to revoke and cancel all rights granted hereunder, provided, however, that before such action by the City shall become operative and effective, the Company shall have been served by the City with a written notice setting forth all matters pertinent to such violation or default, and describing the action of the Council with respect thereto, and the Company shall have had a period of sixty (60) days after service of such notice within which to cure such violation or within which to present a plan, satisfactory to the City, acting reasonably, to affect such cure; and provided further that any violation or default resulting from a strike, a lockout, an act of God, or any other cause beyond the control of the Company shall not constitute grounds for revoking and canceling any rights hereunder. 
Section 16. - Changes in provisions hereof. 
    Changes in the terms and conditions hereof may be made by written agreement between the City and the Company. 
Section 17. - Severability. 
    If any section, part of section, paragraph, sentence, or clause of this Ordinance shall be adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of any other portion hereof, but shall be restricted and limited in its operation and effect to that specific portion hereof involved in the controversy in which such decision shall have been rendered. If either party to this Franchise Agreement feels that elimination of the specific portion of the Franchise Agreement adjudged to be invalid results in significant adverse consequences to itself, then that party may terminate this Franchise Agreement by providing thirty (30) days' written notice to the other party.

    This Ordinance shall become effective immediately upon its passage and adoption, provided the Company shall have signified its acceptance of the franchise hereby granted (with all conditions set forth herein), in writing, within thirty (30) days from the date this Ordinance is duly adopted, the Company's acceptance of said franchise being a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the provisions of this Ordinance.

For the same reason, divisions of article are also typically numbered in multiples of fives (5s) and sections are typically numbered in tens (10s) as initially adopted. All numbers in between such article, division and section numbers are deemed "reserved" for future use. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 5-1515. - Regulations cited by reference.

A.  Beginning and end of period. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed in this chapter, the day of the act, event or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, in which event the period shall run until the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. 
B.  Weekends and holidays. When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than seven (7) days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation. 
C.  Computation in months. When the period of time prescribed or allowed is measured in months, the period will run according to the number of months specified without regard for the number of days in each month, and shall end on the day of the last month of the prescribed or allowed period having the same numerical order as the day from which the computation is made. In the event that the last month of the period is too short to contain the day from which the computation is made, the period computed shall expire with the last day of such month. For example, if a four-month period commences on the 31st of May, it would end on September 30th since September has only thirty (30) days.

A.  Third-party restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or other agreements between parties; provided, however, where this land development code imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings premises, or upon the height of buildings, or requires larger open spaces than are imposed or required by other ordinances, rules, regulations or by easements, covenants, or agreements, the provisions of this chapter shall control. 
B.  Other laws. Where this chapter includes regulations on the same point as contained in any other law or ordinance, the provisions of this land development code shall govern unless otherwise prohibited by law; except that where the regulations of the other law or ordinance are more restrictive than those of this chapter, the other shall govern. 
C.  Internal conflict. Where there is a conflict between any regulations within this chapter, the most recently adopted provision shall govern. In the case of provisions adopted concurrently but still in conflict, the more restrictive standard shall apply. 
D.  Numeric standards. Where the numeric and spelled-out expressions of a given standard contained within this land development code are not in agreement, the stricter and least permissive of the two (2) shall prevail. For example, if a minimum yard requirement is expressed as "twenty-five (5) feet," the text, "twenty-five feet" prevails, and if, for example, a maximum height requirement is expressed as "twenty-five (20) feet," the numeric expression, "(20)" prevails.

B.  Unless otherwise provided, no lot area, yard or other required space shall be reduced in area or dimension so as to make said area or dimension less than the minimum required by this chapter; and if already less than the minimum required by this chapter for a new structure or use, said area or dimension shall not be further reduced.

In the event of such violations or delinquency, the application for development order or permit shall be administratively processed to completion, but shall not be approved, and applications requiring a public hearing shall not be scheduled for public hearing, until the delinquent lien or assessment has been fully paid, and the violation has been placed into compliance. 
C.  Expiration. Any permit or development order issued pursuant to this chapter, for which an expiration timeframe is not established in this chapter, shall be valid for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of issuance unless a different expiration is otherwise provided by official action of the city commission or special master. The planning and zoning director may renew such a permit or development order for one (1) additional six-month period subject to compliance with current requirements of the code in effect at the time of application for renewal. After the date of expiration, the development order shall be null and void. A new development application shall be filed and shall be subject to the current requirements of the chapter. Expiration and extension of building permits are under the jurisdiction of the building code. 
D.  Denial. When the planning and zoning director or other administrative official responsible for making a determination under this chapter determines that the applicant's proposed development will not meet the requirements of this chapter, such official shall reject the application for permit, and the applicant may appeal for a reversal of the decision pursuant to article 55, division 15, appeal of administrative decisions.

4.  The commission may waive the fees contained in this section upon a showing by the charitable organization that said fees are a hardship on said organization and that the city's staff time will not be unduly burdened by the application. The commission may choose to waive the fee entirely or adjust the fee downward upon a showing that staff time will not be unduly burdened. In such case the commission shall appropriate monies from the general fund to reimburse the appropriate fund for the fees being waived.

Sec. 10-20. - Zoning map. 
    The areas assigned to these districts, the designations of the same and the boundaries of said districts shown upon the official zoning map that is on file in the planning and zoning department office and made a part of this chapter are hereby established; and said map and the proper notations, references and other information shown thereon shall be as much a part of this chapter as if the matters and information set forth by said map are attached as appendix A (the maps are not reproduced herein) and are identified by the signatures of the mayor and clerk of the city, together with the number of this chapter and its effective date. Each district shall be subject to the regulations stipulated in this chapter. 
A.  The boundaries of the districts are as shown upon the zoning map which is adopted by references and made a part hereof, and entitled "Official Zoning Map of the City of Parkland, Florida". 
B.  The amended zoning map and all the notations, references and other information shown thereon are a part of this land development code as if such information set forth on the map were all fully described and set out. This amended zoning map, properly attested, shall remain at all times on file in the office of the city clerk. The boundaries of such districts as are shown upon the official zoning map, or as will be shown by subsequent amendment thereto, are adopted and approved, and the regulations of this land development code, governing the use of land and buildings, the height of buildings, building site areas, the size of yards about buildings and other matters as set forth in this land development code, are established and declared to be in effect upon all land included within the boundaries of each and every district shown upon such map. 
C.  In the creation by this land development code of the respective districts, the city commission has given due and careful consideration to the peculiar suitability of each and every such district for the particular regulations applied thereto, and the necessary proper and comprehensive groupings and arrangements of the various uses and densities of population in accordance with a well-considered plan for the development of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 10-30. - Water areas. 
    The water surface and the land under the water surface of all canals, rivers, waterways, ponds, lakes and other water areas in the city not otherwise zoned are hereby placed in the same zoning district as the land which they abut as shown on the zoning map. Where the zoning district shown on the zoning map is different on opposite sides of the water area, then the kind of zoning district on each side shall extend to the centerline or midpoint of the water area. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 10-40. - Districting of vacated ways. 
    Where a street or alley shown on a zoning district map is hereafter officially vacated by replatting or otherwise, the land formerly in such street or alley right-of-way shall be included within the zoning district of the adjoining property on either side of said vacated street or alley. In the event that such street or alley was a district boundary between two (2) or more different zoning districts, the new district boundary shall be the former centerline of such vacated street or alley. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 10-50. - Interpretation of zoning district boundaries. 
    Unless otherwise shown, the district boundaries are right-of-way lines of streets, alleys, or waterways, the subdividing or boundary lines of recorded plats or the extensions thereof; or lot lines or the extensions thereof; and where the districts designated on maps accompanying and made a part of this chapter are approximately bound by street lines, alley lines, waterway lines or the subdividing or boundary lines of recorded plats, extensions thereof, or lot lines or extensions thereof, such lines or the extensions thereof shall be considered to be district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to boundaries of any district, the following rules of interpretation shall apply: 
A.  Lots of record. Where a district boundary divides a lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of the particular district boundary, and the location of the boundary is not dimensioned relative to the lot lines, the boundary shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the map, provided that if the boundary line scales to within twenty-five (25) feet of a lot line, the boundary shall be deemed to be such lot line. 
B.  City limits. Where a district boundary is shown as approximately following city limits it shall be deemed to be following city limits. 
C.  Other interpretations. Where due to scale or illegibility of the zoning map, or due to the absence of a street, alley, easement, waterway or recorded subdivision plat lines, the planning and zoning director finds that there is uncertainty, contradiction or conflict as to the intended location of any district boundary, the planning and zoning director shall be responsible for interpreting the intent of the zoning map to determine and designate the proper location of such district boundary in accordance with the intent and purpose of the code. The ordinance causing the rezoning of land, the supporting materials made part of the city commission's consideration of the ordinance, and city commission meeting minutes concerning the ordinance causing the rezoning shall be primary considerations for determining district boundaries. Appeal from the interpretation of the director shall be to the city commission as required in article 55, division 15, appeal of administrative decisions.

DIVISION 40. - PRD PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT AND PCD PLANNED COMMERCIAL DISTRICT 

Sec. 10-4010. - Purpose. 
A.  The primary purpose of the planned residential development (PRD) district and the planned commercial district (PCD) is to permit land under unified control to be planned and developed as a whole (as a single operation or an approved series of operations) with a greater amount of flexibility by removing some of the detailed restriction of conventional zoning. Planned residential and commercial developments are recognized as serving the public interest and are encouraged for the following reasons (i.e., planned residential and commercial developments): 
1.  Allow diversification of uses, structures and open spaces when not in conflict with existing and permitted land uses on abutting properties; 
2.  Reduce improvement costs through a more effective use of land and a smaller network of utilities and streets than is possible through the application of standards contained in conventional land development regulations; 
3.  Conserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging the preservation and improvement of scenic and functional space; 
4.  Provide maximum opportunity for application of innovative site planning concepts to the creation of aesthetically pleasing environments for living on properties of adequate size, shape and location; 
5.  Ensure that development will occur according to limitations of land use, site design, population density, lot coverage, improvement standards and construction phasing authorized through the approval of a master development plan; 
6.  Ensure that development will occur within the guidelines and intent of the city comprehensive plan. Planned residential and commercial developments are equally adaptable to new development, redevelopment and the conservation of land, water and other city resources. It is the intent of these regulations for planned residential and commercial developments to accomplish not only unified planning but also (to the extent not inconsistent with the intent and objectives of this chapter) the purpose of zoning and other applicable city regulations to the same degree that they are intended to control development on a lot-by-lot basis; and 
7.  Based upon the substantial public advantages of planned residential and commercial development, it is the intent of planned residential and commercial development regulations to promote and encourage development in this form where tracts are suitable in size, location and character for the uses and structures proposed to be planned and developed as unified and coordinated communities. 
B.  The city commission shall only approve a rezoning to a PRD or PCD where the applicant can affirmatively demonstrate that its proposal complies with and furthers the above goals and objectives. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 10-4020. - Unified control. 
    All land included for the purpose of development within a planned residential or commercial development district shall be under the control of the applicant (an individual, partnership or corporation, or group of individuals, partnerships or corporations). The applicant shall present satisfactory legal documents to constitute evidence of the unified control of the entire area within the proposed planned unit development. The applicant shall agree in the application for rezoning to the following: 
A.  To proceed with the proposed development according to the provisions of these regulations and conditions attached to the rezoning of the land to PRD or PCD. 
B.  To provide agreements, contracts, covenants, deed restrictions and sureties acceptable to the city for the completion of the development according to the plans approved at the time of rezoning to PRD or PCD and for continuing operation and maintenance of such areas, functions and facilities which are not proposed to be provided, operated or maintained at public expense. 
C.  If the developer elects to administer common open space through an association or nonprofit corporation, said organization shall conform to the applicable laws of the State of Florida. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 10-4030. - Permitted uses. 
A.  The uses permitted within a PRD shall be consistent with the uses permitted within the residential land use designation of the land use element of the comprehensive plan, as further restricted to the uses permitted in the residential zoning districts of this chapter and by the ordinance rezoning the property to PRD. 
B.  The uses permitted within a PCD shall be restricted to uses permitted in the B-1, B-2 and OP zoning districts of this chapter, as may be further limited by the ordinance rezoning the property to PCD. Places of worship shall be permitted as of right. Residential dwelling units may be permitted in a PCD in accordance with and as allowed by the commercial-to-residential flexibility provisions of the comprehensive plan and Article 2.5 of the Administrative Rules Document of the Broward County Land Use Plan, as may be amended from time to time. However, residential units shall only be permitted in structures that also house commercial uses. No freestanding residential units shall be permitted. In addition, the city commission must make a finding that inclusion of such residential units as part of the overall proposed development is appropriate and will enhance the quality of the project and that the required master plan provides for a compatible co-location of all uses on the project site. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 10-4040. - General provisions. 
    Any land zoned to a PRD or PCD shall be restricted to the uses as specifically approved in the master plan contained in the ordinance approving the PRD or PCD. If a specific parcel or amount of land is set aside for community facility, park, public education and/or conservation as identified on the master plan or approved plat for the area covered by the master plan, any area set aside for such use shall be restricted for the use so specified; such use restriction shall be binding and no change in the use shall be permitted unless the city commission approves an ordinance amending the PRD or PCD and an equal amount of land is set aside within the PRD and PCD parcel or in another area of the City of Parkland for such use and said area is specifically set aside for such use in the master plan and plat, or if outside the PRD or PCD, such land is subject to a binding deed restriction and development agreement acceptable to the city. No application for such change shall be processed by the city unless it bears the signatures of the owners of at least sixty-seven (67) percent of the land area within the PRD or PCD.

All planned residential and commercial developments shall contain a minimum of ten (10) acres of contiguous land unless the city commission finds that a tract which contains less than ten (10) acres is suitable as a planned residential or commercial development by virtue of some unusual conditions; in which case, the minimum may be waived by the city commission. 
B.  Maximum density. 
1.  The total number of dwelling units permitted in a PRD shall not exceed the total number of units permitted by the land use element of the comprehensive plan. The number of dwelling units permitted in a PCD shall be determined by applying the residential-to-commercial flexibility provisions of the comprehensive plan. 
2.  The ordinance adopting the specific rezoning for a given PRD in question shall so specify the allowable number of units permitted in that particular planned residential development. 
C.  Minimum lot area, distance between structures, frontage and setbacks. 
1.  No minimum lot size shall be required within a PRD or PCD. 
2.  No minimum distance between structures shall be required within a PRD or PCD. The appropriate distance between structures shall be evaluated on an individual development basis after considering the type and character of the proposed structure types within a development and after consideration of the relevant provisions of this chapter. 
3.  Each dwelling unit and other permitted use shall have access to a public street either directly, or indirectly via an approach, private road, pedestrian way, court or other area dedicated to public or private use of common easement guaranteeing access. Permitted uses are not required to front on a dedicated road.

Sec. 10-4500. - Purpose of districts. 
A.  B-1 district. The B-1 neighborhood business district is intended primarily to meet the local neighborhood shopping, retail and personal service needs of a limited surrounding residential area. Retail stores permitted herein are intended to include primarily specialized and convenience goods, and personal services uses allowed herein are intended to meet the daily needs of residents of the city's residential communities. 
B.  B-2 district. The B-2 community business district is intended primarily to meet the shopping and personal service needs of several neighborhoods or a substantial territory. B-2 districts may be located along traffic arteries or in concentrated shopping centers.

Such businesses generally require considerable ground area, do not cater directly to pedestrians and need a conspicuous and accessible location convenient for motorists. Property zoned Broward County B-3 retains its pre-annexation zoning designation only with regard to specific rights as set forth in a settlement agreement recorded in Office of Records Book 29272, Pages 1650 through 1699 of the Broward County, Florida Public Records, and are otherwise subject to the provisions of this chapter.

A.  It is the intent of this article to provide in tabular form a listing (herein referred to as the master business list) of the uses that shall be permitted in the various business districts. 
B.  Where an asterisk (*) appears on the same line as a listed use, said use shall be permitted in the district as indicated by the column heading in which the asterisk (*) appears. 
C.  Where no asterisk (*) appears on the same line as a listed use, said use shall be prohibited in the district as indicated by the column heading in the same manner.

For example, "7" means that the applicable supplemental regulation can be found in section 10-4510, supplemental regulations to master business list, as supplemental regulation number 7. 
E.  Where a listed use is followed by restrictions or limitations in parenthesis, the use shall be subject to such restrictions or limitations within each district-as indicated by the column heading-in which the letter "A" appears on the same line as the listed use. 
F.  The planning and zoning director may authorize as a permitted use, a use that is unlisted in the master businesses list and all other lists of permitted, prohibited and special exception uses in this chapter, but is substantially similar in character, impact and compatibility to a listed permitted use within the applicable zoning district. 
G.  The planning and zoning director may authorize the processing of a special exception use application for a use that is unlisted in the master business list, but is substantially similar in character, impact and compatibility to a listed special exception use within the applicable zoning district.

I.  Any use permitted by the city land use plan within the commercial or office park land use categories not listed in the master business list (or the supplemental regulations) as permitted, special exception or prohibited, and which the planning and zoning director does not determine to be substantially similar to a listed permitted or special exception use in any zoning district shall be considered a special exception use within the B-3 zoning district, in accordance with article 60 of this chapter.

Sec. 20-190. - Compatibility and consistency. 
    Notwithstanding the density or intensity and the uses permitted by any zoning district regulations, the planning and zoning board and the city commission shall, in reviewing all plats, plat notes, site plans, and other applications for development permits, consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, consistency and compatibility with the future land use element of the comprehensive plan, together with all other comprehensive plan elements, such as traffic circulation, parks and recreation, conservation, potable water, waste water, and drainage. The city shall also consider adjacent zoning, approved plats and existing land uses, including occupied residential areas. In addition, where there are approved plats, existing land uses, including occupied residential areas, in close proximity to the area where the development permit which is under consideration, then the city shall consider whether the proposed development permit, including the uses to be made thereof, is compatible with those areas. For the purpose of this consideration, and in all instances where compatibility is used herein, compatibility means land uses (which shall include the structure to be constructed and the use to be made of the property) that are congruous, similar and in harmony with one another because they do not create or foster undesirable health, safety or aesthetic effects arising from direct association of dissimilar, contradictory, incongruous, or discordant activities or structures, including the impacts of density, intensity of use, hours of operation, aesthetics, noise, vibration, smoke, offensive odors, mass, shadow effect, the location of structures in close proximity to residential dwellings and other land use conditions or conditions which are likely to have a detrimental impact on the existing uses on lands adjacent to the site in question. This section shall read as supplemental to and complimentary with the requirements and criteria for rezoning of property, approval of a special exception use, approval of a site plan, and all other provisions of this chapter that require a determination of compatibility. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 20-200. - Open space and pervious area requirements. 
A.  The city engineer shall determine the amount of pervious credit, if any, to be given for ground covered by decks, paver blocks, pervious pavement, and similar materials that are partially permeable, based upon the degree to which the material and construction method allow for the infiltration of water. 
B.  The common open space requirement may be partially satisfied off-site within three hundred (300) feet of the development that the open space is intended to serve, and must be reasonably accessible to all residents of the development. If off-site open space is provided, the owner of said open space shall provide a unity of title agreement to the city between the common open space parcel and the residential development site. Said unity of title shall be recorded at the expense of the owner, shall run with the land, and shall bind the heirs, successors, and assigns of the owner. Said unity of title shall be worded so that it may be voided by the city if other provisions are made for common open space pursuant to the requirements of the Municipal Code. When common open space is located off site, it shall only receive a maximum credit of ten (10) percent towards the total pervious open space requirement.

ARTICLE 25. - NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES 

Sec. 25-10. - Intent and purpose; existing use. 
    The purpose and intent of this article is to regulate and limit the development and continued existence of uses and structures that were lawfully established but do not comply with the regulations of this land development code and were made nonconforming by the original adoption of this land development code or subsequent amendments hereto. A use is nonconforming if it fails to comply with all the requirements of the zoning district in which it is located or any land development regulation or is located in a nonconforming building. A lot, a building or a structure is nonconforming if it fails to comply with the requirements of the zoning district in which it is located or the land development regulations or it houses, or is the site of a nonconforming use. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 25-20. - Regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures or lands. 
    No existing building, structure or lands devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, substituted or structurally altered, except when changed to a conforming use or when required to do so by law. 
A.  Restoration. Any nonconforming structure which has less than fifty (50) percent of its previous existing floor area made unsafe or unusable, may be restored or reconstructed for its intended use, provided that the floor area of such use, building or structure shall not exceed the floor area which existed prior to such damage. All repairs shall be completed within one (1) year after damages occur or such use shall not be rebuilt except as a conforming use. 
B.  Repair. Normal maintenance repair and incidental alteration of a structure containing a nonconforming use is permitted, provided it does not extend the area or volume of space occupied by the nonconforming use or increase the noise level, amount of odors, or emissions emanating from the nonconforming use. A building or other structure containing residential nonconforming uses may be altered in any way to improve interior livability, provided however, that no structural alterations shall be made which would increase the number of dwelling units or the square footage or height of any building. 
C.  Site or building alterations. Site or building alterations to nonconforming lands, buildings, or structures are not permitted unless the city commission finds that: 
1.  The land, building, or structure is nonconforming because one (1) or more physical characteristics, not including use, of the development are nonconforming; and 
2.  The proposed alterations do not increase the size of the building or structure; and 
3.  Proposed alterations do not permit a nonconforming use to be expanded. No nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land, building, or structure than was occupied on the date the use became nonconforming. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 25-30. - Regulation of nonconforming uses. 
A.  Nonconforming uses of land, buildings or structures. No nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land, building or structure than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
B.  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this section. 
C.  No existing land, building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in its zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 25-40. - Termination of nonconforming use. 
A.  Abandonment. A nonconforming use discontinued or not used for a period of more than ninety (90) consecutive days (not including closure for renovations or repairs) or the change of use to a conforming use for any period of time, shall be considered an abandonment thereof, and such nonconforming use shall not thereafter be revived. When a nonconforming lot, building or structure is not used for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days (except when governmental action impedes access to the premises), the land, building, or structure shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. If a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned on a portion of the land or structure for ninety (90) consecutive days, that portion of the land or structure shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
B.  Land or structures shall not be deemed to be active and in continued nonconforming usage solely from the existence of a state license or local business tax receipt permitting such a use or business, but such use or business must be actively undertaken, staffed and in operation, unless other facts show legally sufficient activity, for such use or business to be deemed in active continued nonconforming usage. 
C.  It shall constitute a rebuttable presumption that the use has been abandoned if a land, building, or structure is noted by city code inspectors or police officers to be vacant and/or unoccupied during the ninety-day period. Unoccupied means any land, building or structure which is not being used by persons authorized by the owner of the property on which such building or structure is located. Vacant and/or unoccupied also means where utility services have been terminated. 
D.  Partial destruction. When fifty (50) percent or more of the existing floor area of a nonconforming structure is destroyed by fire or other casualty or act of God and as a result becomes unsafe or unusable, the use of such structure as a nonconforming use shall thereafter be terminated. Provided that, where a nonconforming use is a residence located in a residential zoning district, it may be reconstructed to its prior condition, even if more than fifty (50) percent of the floor area is destroyed. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
ARTICLE 30. - GENERAL DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCEDURES 

Sec. 30-10. - Administration; generally applicable procedures. 
A.  Administration of article. The application submittal and review requirements of this article shall be administered by the planning and zoning director (as used herein, the term "director" shall mean the director of the planning and zoning division or his or her designee) who shall specify the format of applications and other routine document forms, establish administrative procedures and prepare administrative reports to implement the requirements of this article. 
B.  Required approvals, generally. In order to develop land in the city, one (1) or more of the following procedures are generally required depending upon the specifics of the case; all of the following applications except for comprehensive plan amendments, are considered development permit applications by state statute: 
  Comprehensive plan amendment; 
  Rezoning or land development code text change; 
  Plat approval or amendment; 
  Site plan or amendment; 
  Community appearance; 
  Special exception; 
  Planned unit development or amendment; 
  Master development plan or amendment; 
  Variance; 
  Building or sign permit. 
C.  Qualified applicants. Qualified applicants shall be limited to the following: 
1.  For vacation or abandonment of rights-of-way, the owner or agent of the owner of property adjacent to the right-of-way, having unified control or a recognizable interest in the property, provided all owners and all holders of equitable interest, including purchasers, have authorized the application as required by law. 
2.  For administrative appeals, any person who has been aggrieved by an order, requirement, determination or decision on the basis of an alleged error made by the official or employee. 
3.  For all other applications, the owner, or agent of the owner, having unified control or a recognizable interest in the property, provided all owners and all holders of equitable interest, including purchasers, have authorized the application as required by law. For example, for a property owned by a trust, the trust agreement may allow two (2) of three (3) trustees to authorize such an application. 
4.  Only the city commission, planning and zoning board and city manager may initiate map and text amendments to the code and comprehensive plan. 
5.  The city manager and city commission may initiate any application for land under city control, including vacations of right-of-way. 
D.  Development application requirements. Every application for a development permit shall be in a form specified by the planning and zoning division and shall be accompanied by a fee, and commitment for cost recovery as established from time to time by the city, to defray the costs of processing and reviewing the application and the required notice. The application shall be prepared in the appropriate number of copies, accompanied by such plans, data, or documents specified by the application form or such additional information that may be requested by the director. 
E.  Pre-application conference. The director, at his/her option, may schedule and hold pre-application conferences for the purpose of reviewing the proposed development prior to the formal submission of an application for development approval. Failure of staff to identify any requirements at a pre-application conference shall not constitute waiver of the application of any requirements of this land development code. The director shall have the authority, based upon the nature of the application, to waive the pre-application conference requirement or to require payment for staff time and expenses incurred in the review of the pre-application documentation. 
F.  Filing of applications. The director shall establish application filing deadlines and a review schedule for all applications. All applications for a development permit filed with the planning and zoning division shall be reviewed to determine whether the application is complete. If it is determined that the application is not sufficient, written notice shall be served on the applicant specifying the deficiencies. The planning and zoning division shall take no further action on the application until the deficiencies are remedied. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiencies within twenty (20) working days after it is determined not sufficient, the application shall be considered withdrawn. If or when the application is determined sufficient, the director shall place the application on a development review committee meeting pursuant to subparagraph H.2., below. An application for development approval may not be scheduled for further processing until all required information has been submitted and the required review agencies have completed their review. 
[EDITOR'S NOTE: F.S. ch. 160, limits the number of times that an application can be held for incompleteness to three (3) before requiring a denial with specific findings.] 
G.  Development review committee duties. There shall be created a development review committee ("DRC") consisting of a committee as determined by the director. The committee shall review development permit applications submitted pursuant to this chapter when required pursuant to Table 22-1, to ensure that the applications are consistent with the requirements of the city's comprehensive plan and this Code, and provide specific comments and recommendations regarding the application. 
H.  Development review committee (DRC) process. The DRC shall review applications for development permits pursuant to Table 22-1, and provide comments at a publicly noticed DRC meeting, except when the director determines that full DRC review and a meeting of the DRC is not necessary due to the limited scope of an application. The director shall notify the applicant in writing as to the scheduled DRC meeting date or determination that the scope of the application does not require a meeting of the DRC. This subsection shall govern the DRC review process and shall control over any conflicting provision in this chapter. 
1.  When the director determines that full DRC review is not required, the director shall distribute the application only to those DRC members whose review the director deems to be pertinent. The director shall forward any review comments to the applicant. Upon satisfaction of all review comments and determination that the application satisfies all requirements of this Code, the director and DRC members who reviewed the application shall each, individually, certify the application. The certification shall indicate that the director waived review by other DRC members. 
2.  When the director determines that full DRC review is required, the planning and zoning division shall provide the applicant with a draft list of issues, if any, prior to the DRC meeting. The DRC shall be convened pursuant to the planning and zoning division calendar or as otherwise determined by the director, to review the application and determine whether it should be certified. The director can schedule a special DRC meeting if he/she determines such a meeting would be in the best interest of the city. An application shall not be certified unless it meets the minimum standards as outlined in this chapter. An application shall not be forwarded to the planning and zoning board for review until it has been certified by the DRC. At the DRC meeting, the planning and zoning division shall advise the applicant of the DRC's decision and any comments and conditions determined by the DRC to be necessary to comply with this Code, and send via electronic mail a copy of the decision to the applicant. An applicant shall be provided an opportunity after the DRC meeting to satisfy any requirements without returning to a subsequent DRC meeting, unless the director determines that the applicant has not satisfactorily addressed major requirements that warrant a subsequent meeting. The director may allow continuance of a DRC as necessary to address any issues identified by the committee. If the application is certified and planning and zoning board approval of the application is required, the public hearing on the application shall then be scheduled for the planning and zoning board to be held within sixty (60) days. 
3.  Development applications shall undergo review by the DRC, PZB and/or city commission pursuant to this paragraph, which together with this subsection shall govern over any conflicting requirement in this chapter.

***  Note: there are several specialized appeal processes in this Code that pertain to particular types of permits or approvals. Section 55-1510 applies wherever this chapter does not otherwise provide for a specific administrative appeal process. 
1.  "Y" denotes that review/approval is required. Where city commission approval is indicated, the "Y" can denote formal approval by the commission or commission notice and review via the call up procedure pursuant to subsection J., as applicable. 
2.  "N" denotes that review/approval is not required. 
3.  "D" denotes that review/approval may be required depending on the nature of the application, as determined by the director, and indicates that an application does not automatically require public hearings, and may be processed as a call-up item pursuant to subsection J, if the director determines that the application does not constitute a substantial change from the previous approval. 
4.  PZB decision is final unless appealed to the city commission pursuant to section 15-1510. 
I.  Action by planning and zoning board. If review of the application by the planning and zoning board is required in subsection H.3., the director shall compile a written report which summarizes the facts of the application including all documents that he or she determines are relevant, and evaluates the proposed application with the general purpose and standards set forth in the land development code, which shall be transmitted to the planning and zoning board. If the planning and zoning board finds that the application is in compliance with the land development code, then the board shall recommend approval of the application to the city commission. If the planning and zoning board finds that the proposed application is not in compliance with the comprehensive plan or these land development regulations, then the board shall recommend denial of the application to the city commission. To the extent deemed feasible by the board, its recommendation of denial shall cite the sections of the comprehensive plan or land development code which have not been satisfied; however, the failure of the board to do so shall not affect the validity of its recommendation and the recommendation shall be transmitted to the city commission, with or without such detail. 
J.  Action by city commission. Applications that require city commission approval pursuant to subsection H.3. shall be processed pursuant to paragraph 1., below. Applications that do not automatically require city commission approval in table 22-1 may be processed as commissioner call-up items pursuant to paragraph 2., below. 
1.  Applications that require city commission approval. The director shall prepare a copy of the complete application and a written staff report summarizing the facts of the case including all documents that he or she determines are relevant, and the recommendations of the planning and zoning board, if applicable. In cases where planning and zoning board review is required, the director shall schedule the application for a city commission meeting to be held within sixty (60) days of the action by the planning and zoning board. The required notice procedures of Table 22-2 shall be met. In considering a proposed development application, the city commission shall review the proposed application, the city's comprehensive plan and these land development regulations, the report of the administration and recommendation of the planning and zoning board, if applicable to the application, and any oral and written comments received before or at the public hearing. Based upon the record developed at the public hearings, the city commission may: 
a.  Approve the proposed application with or without modifications by resolution/ordinance, and conditions; or 
b.  Reject the proposed application which rejection shall note the specific provisions of the comprehensive plan or land development regulations not satisfied by the application; or 
c.  Refer the matter to the planning and zoning board or administration for further consideration. 
2.  Action by city commission for call-up items as indicated in Table 22-1. When city commission review of an application type is indicated with a "D" in table 22-1, the director may determine that the scope and impact of a particular application is minor in nature, and does not substantially alter the prior city commission approval. In such cases, the application shall be processed as follows. 
a.  The city manager shall forward a copy of the complete application and a brief memorandum prepared by the director to each city commissioner. The memorandum shall summarize the facts of the case relative to prior approvals, and the director's reasoning for considering the application to be minor in nature and not a substantial change to a prior commission approval. 
b.  Each city commissioner shall have six (6) business days, starting on the date the city manager distributes the application and memorandum, to review the application and provide a written response to the city manager stating whether he or she wishes the application to be scheduled for public hearings. 
c.  If any commissioner responds within the allocated timeframe in b., above, that he or she wishes to consider the application at a public hearing of the city commission (i.e., call up the application), the director shall automatically advertise and schedule the application for public hearings before the planning and zoning board (if applicable) and the city commission to take place within forty-five (45) days of the commissioner call-up request. Absent such a request from any of the city commissioners within the allocated timeframe, the application shall be approved without the requirement of a public hearing. 
K.  Rescheduled meeting dates. Meetings may be continued to a date certain without further notice at the sole discretion of the city, except as provided for by F.S. ch. 166. 
L.  Time periods not mandatory. The failure to schedule or advance an application by the city in a timely manner as set forth herein shall be without prejudice to the city's rights and shall not constitute approval of any application. All time periods relative to city action are directory not mandatory. 
M.  Examination and copying of application and other documents. At any time during normal business hours of the city, upon reasonable request any person may examine an application for development approval and materials submitted in support of or in opposition thereto. Copies of such materials shall be made available upon payment of the appropriate fee. 
N.  Resubmission of applications after denial. An application for development approval which has been denied may not be resubmitted for reconsideration for a period of one (1) year after the date on which an application for the same development application has been denied by the city commission. 
O.  Reliance on information presented by applicant. The city and its departments, boards and agencies shall have the right to rely on the accuracy of statements, documents and all other information presented to them by the applicant or his/her agent, in review of an application for development approval issued under this Code. It shall be a violation of this section for any applicant to submit information which it knows to be false or inaccurate in a material way or which it has reason to believe is false or inaccurate in any material way. The submission of false or inaccurate information shall be grounds to void any approval or development permit granted pursuant to this section. The city may void said approval or development permit at any time after it determines that such false or inaccurate information was submitted as part of this process. All renderings used by the applicant in a presentation before the city commission shall be the property of the city and said renderings shall become part of the approval unless otherwise specified by the commission. The failure to undertake the project in material conformance with said renderings shall be a violation of this land development code and shall be grounds for code enforcement prosecution or the denial of future development permits for the project. 
P.  Application annulment. If an applicant fails to act upon a submitted application (as evidenced by the submission of a response or pursuing the next step in the process set forth herein) within a ninety-day period after receiving written comments from the DRC, or specific DRC members as determined by the director, the application will be deemed null and void. The director may extend the ninety-day requirement if he or she determines that reasonable progress is being made in revising the application. 
Q.  Timing of notice. The "timing of notice" columns in table 22-2 refer to the minimum number of calendar days prior to the date of a public hearing, not including the date of the hearing, that: 
1.  The newspaper advertisement must appear in the newspaper; and 
2.  Mail notices must be mailed. 
R.  Mail notices. 
1.  Mail notice is the responsibility of the applicant for the development application requiring mailed notice pursuant to table 22-2. 
2.  The mail notice radius in table 22-2 shall be measured from the boundaries of the land that is the subject of the application. The applicant shall produce a certified radius map and mailing list of all property owners within the required radius. The city shall maintain a list of radius map and mailing list providers which the applicant may utilize. Mail notice may be provided through one (1) of the following: bulk mail, first class mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, as determined by the director. 
3.  Upon completing the mailing, the applicant shall provide to the planning and zoning division the radius map and mailing list, and a sworn affidavit attesting that he or she mailed notice to all property owners within the required mail notice radius. Mail notice shall be sent U.S. mail to: 
a.  The owner of the subject property, as well as the petitioner; and 
b.  The persons shown on the current tax rolls of Broward County to be the respective owners; or 
c.  In the case of a condominium, notice shall be sent to the board of directors of the applicable condominium association; 
d.  Mail notice shall only be required to owners of land located within the city's boundaries. 
e.  Mail notice is not required for items that are processed pursuant to paragraph J.2., unless one (1) or more city commissioners exercises the call-up option and subjects the application to a public hearing. 
4.  The planning and zoning division shall prepare the notification of hearing to be mailed by the applicant. The mail notice shall contain substantially the same information as provided in the newspaper advertisement for the same application, if required. The mail notice shall comply with any other requirements of this Code as specifically required for the development application, and shall also contain the address and the legal description of the subject property, the approximate relation to the nearest cross streets; and a map or demarcated aerial photograph showing its approximate size, location and relationship to adjacent properties. 
5.  Mail notice is a courtesy that supplements other forms of notice. Therefore, the mailing of such notices shall constitute service. Non-receipt of mail notice by any property owner within the required mailing radius does not constitute grounds for re-advertising or conducting additional public hearings, and shall not affect any action or proceeding taken. 
6.  When more than one (1) hearing is required or occurs before any given body, mail notice shall be required only for the first such hearing, except that one (1) mailing is required for each city commission public hearing to consider adoption of large-scale land use plan map amendments. 
7.  When an application other than a zoning change or land use plan map amendment is subject to public hearings by both the planning and zoning board and city commission, a single mail notification advising of both hearings may be sent to prior to the first of such hearings to satisfy the mail notice requirements of this subsection, as well as other sections of the code that require mail notice for both planning and zoning board and city commission hearings. This provision shall govern over any conflicting provision of this chapter. 
8.  It shall be the responsibility of each person who receives mail notification to track the progress of an application in the event that the application does not proceed to any of the noticed public hearings on the date(s) indicated in the mail-out, whether by reason of deferral to a date certain, meeting cancellation or other cause. Additional mail notification is not required in such instances. 
9.  Mail notice for any city-initiated amendment to the land use plan map or official zoning map shall be provided only to the owners of properties that are included within the map amendment and would experience a change in zoning or land use upon adoption of the amendment. 
S.  Newspaper notices. 
1.  All required newspaper advertisements shall be placed in one (1) or more newspapers of general paid circulation in Broward County, and of general interest and readership in the community, not one of limited subject matter. Standard newspaper advertisements shall contain all information required by law for such advertisements. 
2.  As an alternative to newspaper notice, the city clerk may post the information for the public notification on the city's website and within the lobby of city hall, unless otherwise provided by law for certain comprehensive plan and land development code text and map amendments in paragraph 3., below. Such alternative noticing is subject to the same notice timeframes required for newspaper advertisements. Notice on the website shall be accessible directly from the home page. Whenever the term "newspaper notice" is used in this chapter, the term shall mean newspaper notice or the alternative notice procedure as provided in this subsection. 
3.  Comprehensive plan (text and land use plan map) amendments, code amendments changing the list of permitted, prohibited and conditional uses of land, and rezonings initiated by the city, are specifically regulated by F.S. § 166.041, as may be amended from time to time. Pursuant to said section, such advertisements shall not be placed within the legal advertisement section of the newspaper. The ad shall be two (2) columns in width by ten (10) inches in length, shall prominently state "NOTICE OF LAND USE CHANGE" or similar in eighteen (18) point type, and shall include a location map as applicable. Small-scale land use plan map amendments are not subject to this requirement, and can be advertised using a standard legal ad. 
4.  Newspaper notice is not required for call-up items processed pursuant to paragraph J.2., unless one (1) or more commissioners exercise the call-up option and subject the item to a public hearing. 
T.  Public hearing notice signs. All applicants applying for development approval of vacant land shall cause to be posted a sign or signs notifying the public of any public hearing related thereto. Creation and installation of the signs shall be the responsibility of the applicant and subject to the following conditions: 
1.  The sign shall be posted at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the date of the first public hearing (eight (8) days if the seventh day is a holiday) and shall not be removed by the applicant until the final hearing is closed; 
2.  The sign shall be firmly secured to the ground to prevent vandalism and shall be installed along the most visible portion of road frontage. The sign shall be erected in a manner so as to be visible to traffic moving in both directions and be perpendicular to the roadway, except in the case of signs at the end of cul-de-sacs. If there is more than one (1) frontage of the parcel on an improved street or streets, one (1) sign for each frontage shall be posted; 
3.  The composition of the sign shall be of a durable material (wood or metal) forty (40) inches by forty (40) inches in size painted white with black sans serif lettering such as Arial having a minimum height of four (4) inches with a letter stroke of one (1) inch; 
4.  The sign verbiage shall conform to specifications supplied by the planning and zoning department; 
5.  A code enforcement officer shall file a report or affidavit with the city commission that the sign was observed in place in accordance with the above; 
6.  An application for which the specifications of this subsection are not met shall be pulled from the applicable public hearing agenda and shall be required to withdraw their application and file a new application and fee; 
7.  The sign shall be taken down within one (1) week following the close of the final public hearing; thereafter the city may remove the sign and retain the bond; 
8.  A fifty-dollar bond to cover the removal of the sign shall be refundable upon removal of the sign by the applicant. 
U.  Required public notice and public hearings. This subsection determines the minimum notification requirements for both public hearings and administrative approval of development applications under this chapter. Applications that are processed via the call up procedure, as provided in paragraph J.2., are not subject to the provisions of this subsection. As used in this subsection, N/A means, "not applicable"; PZB means, "Planning and Zoning Board"; and ft., means "feet".

Sec. 30-30. - Compatibility and consistency. 
    Notwithstanding the density or intensity and the uses permitted by any zoning district regulations, the planning and zoning board and the city commission shall, in reviewing all plats, plat notes, site plans, and other applications for development permits, consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to consistency and compatibility with the future land use element of the comprehensive plan, together with all other comprehensive plan elements, such as traffic circulation, parks and recreation, conservation, potable water, waste water, and drainage. The city shall also consider adjacent zoning, approved plats and existing land uses, including occupied residential areas. In addition, where there are approved plats, existing land uses, including occupied residential areas, in close proximity to the area where the development permit which is under consideration, then the city shall consider whether the proposed development permit, including the uses to be made thereof, is compatible with those areas. For the purpose of this consideration, and in all instances where compatibility is used herein, compatibility means land uses (which shall include the structure to be constructed and the use to be made of the property) that are congruous, similar and in harmony with one another because they do not create or foster undesirable health, safety or aesthetic effects arising from direct association of dissimilar, contradictory, incongruous, or discordant activities or structures, including the impacts of density, intensity of use, hours of operation, aesthetics, noise, vibration, smoke, offensive odors, mass, shadow effect, the location of structures in close proximity to residential dwellings and other land use conditions or conditions which are likely to have a detrimental impact on the existing uses on lands adjacent to the site in question. This section shall read as supplemental to, and complimentary with, the requirement for finding of compatibility that is set forth in the respective provisions of this chapter governing the processing, review and approval of petitions for special exceptions, rezonings, site plans, relief from the terms of this chapter, and community appearance board applications.

ARTICLE 35. - IMPACT ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS OF ADEQUACY 

Sec. 35-10. - Concurrency requirements for level of service. 
A.  [Requirements.] No application for a rezoning containing a master development plan, plat, site plan, special exception or building permit, or plat note amendment shall be approved which causes the following levels of service (LOS) to fall below those set forth in the comprehensive plan. This requirement shall be met by assuring that the following levels of service are met concurrently with the impacts of the development: 
Category Level of Service Traffic circulation: Collector roads LOS "D" peak hour Arterial roads non Florida Intrastate Highway (FISH) Roadways LOS "D" Daily LOS "D" Peak Hour LOS "D" Peak Hour Peak Direction Arterial roads Florida Turnpike LOS "D" Arterial roads Sawgrass Expressway LOS "D"  Holmberg Road, east of University Drive, has been specifically designated as a two-lane road within the city not suitable or desirable for expansion. All development permit applications shall use all available and professionally accepted design features or take other necessary measures on site or on roads which are part of necessary safe and adequate access, or on city or county trafficways abutting the development to mitigate potential traffic impacts to Holmberg Road to the extent feasible. Potable water 350 GPD/ERC Existing development, one (1) unit per acre Private wells Potable water service includes publicly and privately owned water treatment facilities and wells on individual parcels of land which will provide for the needs of the proposed development. Wastewater 300 GPD/ERC Existing development, one (1) unit per acre Septic tanks Solid waste , per capita per day 3.8 lbs. The proposed development shall be designed to provide adequate areas to store waste until the time of collection, which areas shall be easily accessible and approved by the solid waste disposal service provider. Drainage 25-year storm over a 72-hour duration for discharge from the site 
Ten-year storm over a 24-hour duration for minimum road elevations 
100-year storm over a 72-hour duration for minimum finished floor elevation At no time shall storage be permitted within parking lot pavement until the storm event criteria have been satisfied. An exception to elevation standards necessary for flood protection may be made only to the degree that it would be impossible to comply with the elevation criteria without creating a greater probability of flooding existing buildings on adjacent lots. All required easements shall be granted to the appropriate governmental entity prior to the issuance of a building permit. Parks, recreation and open space, 
per 1,000 persons total 
10 acres  
B.  [Available capacity a factor.] The determination of available capacity shall factor in the demand of all development that is occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which facility capacity has been reserved. 
C.  Availability of facilities to satisfy concurrency. A developer shall have satisfied the requirements of this subsection if: 
1.  The necessary facilities are in place at the time the development permit is issued or a plat approval is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities will be in place when the impacts of the development occur. 
2.  The necessary facilities are under construction at the time a city development permit is issued. 
3.  The necessary facilities are the subject of a binding contract executed for the construction of those necessary facilities at the time a city development permit is issued. 
4.  The necessary facilities have been included in the city's, the county's or the state's annual budget at the time a development permit is issued although the facilities are not yet the subject of a binding contract for their construction. 
5.  The developer demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the city's commission, through objective evidence that the development will not cause a deterioration in levels of service or that any such deterioration can be mitigated by actions of the developer, which actions shall be reduced to a written agreement satisfactory to the city. 
6.  The developer has a plat for the subject property approved by the city, recorded in the public records of Broward County subsequent to March 20, 1979, or the developer has a plat for the subject property approved by the city and Broward County within the eighteen-month period prior to city commission consideration of a site plan; for plats approved only by Broward County for this period, the city commission must determine by resolution that the impacts of the proposed development shall not create impacts on the infrastructure of the city such that the ability of the city to maintain the levels of service set forth in the comprehensive plan are impeded in any way. This vesting is solely for the purpose of a concurrency determination and shall only be to the extent of the levels of development for which the plat was reviewed as set forth in the above-described resolution. This shall not relieve the applicant of any impact fee or dedication requirements contained herein. 
7.  The developer has a planned unit development approved by the city which specifically provides for park and open space dedications consistent with the dedication requirements existing at the time the PUD was approved and the application is for a development permit which does not increase residential density or commercial square footage. 
8.  In all cases, except as otherwise provided in F.S. § 163.3180, when adequate facility capacity does not exist at the time of development permit, then issuance of such permit shall be conditioned upon capacity becoming available concurrent with the impacts of the development. 
D.  Timing of determination. For the purposes of determining concurrency, the levels of service existing at the time a completed application for plat, site plan, special exception or building permit, whichever occurs first, is submitted in accordance with the provisions herein shall be determinative provided that, if no final action is taken on the permit application within one hundred eighty (180) days, the levels of service will be adjusted to reflect any changes which have occurred during that period, and any concurrency determination shall be made based upon that adjusted data. 
E.  Private property rights. Nothing in this section or the city concurrency management system regulations shall be construed or applied to result in a temporary or permanent taking of private property without due process of law. 
F.  Additional adequacy requirements for roads. 
1.  Any right-of-way required by the Broward County Trafficways Plan shall be dedicated by plat, deed or easement, as deemed acceptable to Broward County and the city prior to issuance of a building permit for a principal building. 
2.  The applicant shall demonstrate that the local streets and roads which will serve the development will provide safe and adequate access between the regional transportation network and the proposed development and shall have the capacity to serve the proposed development at the level of service established by the city. 
3.  The capacity of the local street and road network shall be determined based upon sound standards and principles of traffic engineering considering to the extent available: 
a.  Existing transportation studies; 
b.  The traffic generation characteristic of the proposed development; 
c.  Any other information that may be relevant. 
4.  In determining the capacity of the local roads, it shall be assumed that all projects funded for construction under the city's adopted capital improvements program, when such program is adopted, as well as those network improvements committed and evidenced by contract with other municipalities or county, state and federal agencies in their annual budgets have been completed and are part of such network. 
5.  If it is found that the off-site local street and road network needed to provide safe and adequate access between the regional transportation network and the proposed development is unpaved, lacks the capacity to accommodate the additional traffic generated by the proposed development at the level of service or is not constructed, it shall be determined whether such paving, capacity or roadway construction will be available if all of the transportation improvements contained in the city's capital improvement plan are completed. If it is determined that such paving or capacity will be available, then the specific improvements necessary to enable the network to reach such capacity shall be identified (hereinafter referred to as necessary improvements), and the application shall be granted with an express condition regarding the adequacy of such local roads. At the sole discretion of the city commission, such condition shall require any combination of the following: 
a.  That for off-site local roads the applicant shall construct to all city specifications the share of the necessary improvements proportional to the share of the additional capacity created by such improvements that is needed to accommodate traffic generated by the applicant's development; or 
b.  That the applicant deposit money in the road fund, as defined in paragraph 6, below, equal to the share of the cost of the improvements that would otherwise be required in paragraph above. 
6.  A road fund that is created pursuant to subparagraph F.5.b, of this section shall be maintained by the city and shall be subject to the regulations of this section. The road fund shall be expended prior to or contemporaneously with the expenditure of any other public fund necessary for the construction of the necessary improvements. 
7.  Prior to the issuance of a building permit for any portion of a development, any right-of-way for local public roads within the development needed to provide safe and adequate access to the development shall be dedicated to the city by deed or plat or granted by easement. 
8.  Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a principal building within a development, the developer shall construct to all applicable city standards all local roads, both public and private, that are internal to the development (either in total or in part as pre-approved phased construction plans) and necessary to provide safe and adequate access to the development. 
G.  Adequacy of fire protection service. Fire protection service is adequate to protect people and property in the proposed development; or fire protection service is not available, but there exists a fiscally feasible plan (which shall include collection of impact fees) to expand fire protection service to provide for the needs of the proposed development; and all development permits will be granted on the condition that the proposed development be restricted to coincide with the implementation of such plan. A finding that adequate fire protection service is available shall be based on a demonstration that adequate fire personnel and apparatus and an adequate water supply will be available to service the fire protection needs of the new development and that the location of the city's fire stations will provide fire service to the development within acceptable response time. 
H.  Adequacy of police protection service. Police protection is adequate to protect people and property in the proposed development; or police protection service is not available, but there exists a fiscally feasible plan (which shall include collection of impact fees) to expand police protection service to provide for the needs of the proposed development; and all development permits will be granted on the condition that the proposed development be restricted to coincide with the implementation of such plan. 
I.  Public safety impact fees. The provision of adequate fire and police protection is essential for the health and safety of the public and citizens of the City of Parkland. Without the imposition of an impact fee, the city will either, have to utilize additional general fund revenues to serve the demands of new development or experience a declining level of service as the current inventory of infrastructure serves additional new development. The impact fees set forth herein are based upon the study conducted by TischlerBise, dated June 23, 2010, as amended from time to time (a copy of which is on file with the city clerk) and is based upon recent and localized data. The impact fees are designed to represent the new development's proportionate share of the capital costs associated with providing additional fire and police infrastructure capacity to serve the new development. The Florida Legislature has found, in F.S. § 163.31801, that impact fees are an important source of revenue for local government to use in funding the infrastructure necessitated by new growth. The purpose of this impact fee ordinance is to assure new development pays its fair share for infrastructure which is necessitated by new growth and that the fees paid will benefit the new growth. 
1.  Fire impact fees. A fire impact fee is hereby imposed against all residential and nonresidential buildings constructed in the City of Parkland. Any application for a building permit in the City of Parkland shall be subject to the assessment of this fee. The impact fees shall be paid prior to receiving any building permits for a residential or nonresidential building in the City of Parkland and shall be paid based upon the schedule below.

J.  Adequacy of local parks and recreation facilities. Land designated for residential development pursuant to the applicable land development regulations shall be designated to provide for the park, open space and recreational needs of the future residents of the development area. 
1.  In order to provide lands or funds or both to be used to provide community and neighborhood parks necessary to meet the needs for such local level parks created by additional residential development within the city, a developer, prior to plat recordation, site plan approval or the issuance of a building permit for a principal residential building, whichever occurs first, must either, at the discretion of the city commission, comply with paragraph 1. or 2. below: 
a.  Dedicate land of suitable size, dimension, topography and general location which will meet local level park needs created by the development. The total amount of land to be dedicated must equal the following: Five (5) acres of land for every one thousand (1,000) projected residents estimated to occupy the development under the following formula for active or passive parks, which includes but is not limited to lands determined to be environmentally sensitive but shall not include required landscaped areas and land within public road rights-of-way or easements: 
Density in Dwelling Units Per Gross 
Acre of Residential Land Area Estimated Number of Persons per Dwelling Unit From 0 up to 1 3.5 Over 1 up to 3 3.3 Over 3 up to 5 3.0 Over 5 up to 10 2.5 Over 10 up to 16 2.0 Over 16 up to 25 1.8  
b.  Agree to deposit in a nonlapsing trust fund, established and maintained by the city for the purchase and development of parks and recreation facilities, an amount of money equal to or exceeding the fair market value of such amount of land as would have been required under subsection J.1.a. above. The value of the land shall be determined by, at the city's option, the most recent sale, contract or option price or the value as determined by a professional appraisal. 
2.  The developer shall, to the satisfaction of the city commission, identify the availability of five (5) acres of additional park, recreation and open space areas on site which will meet local level park, recreation and open space needs attributable to the development. Such additional park, recreation and open space areas may include the following: 
a.  Fifty (50) percent of lakes or water bodies which at the narrowest point are at least seventy-five (75) feet wide. 
b.  Private recreation and open space areas at least one-half (1/2) acre in size minimum. 
c.  Public trails and paths outside of public rights-of-way. 
d.  Commercial recreation. 
e.  Buffer areas and entrance treatments at least fifteen (15) feet width that are located along public roadways identified on the Broward County Trafficways Plan or the city's traffic element. For the purpose of this calculation, the developer shall be required to count and preserve environmentally sensitive areas. 
In the event that the developer cannot identify such additional park, recreation and open space level of service as set forth in subsection J.2., the developer must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city commission that such deficiency can be mitigated by actions of the developer, which actions shall be reduced to a written agreement satisfactory to the city provided that the requirement to identify the additional five (5) acres in subsection J.2. shall not apply to the development of a single-family residence on a lot of record as of February 7, 1990. 
K.  Adequacy of school facilities; school concurrency. Land designated for residential development pursuant to the applicable land development regulations shall provide for the educational needs of the future residents of the developed area in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Broward County Land Development Code. All plats, replats, plat note amendments, findings of adequacy, or site plans with a residential component shall be subject to the public school concurrency requirements as set forth in subsection 5-182(m) of the Broward County Land Development Code, as amended from time to time, which regulations and requirements are incorporated herein by reference. The burden shall be on the applicant to ensure compliance with this section, and the applicant shall provide the necessary documentation from Broward County demonstrating satisfaction of these requirements. 
L.  Adequacy of government buildings and library facilities. 
1.  Government buildings include: administrative buildings, public works buildings, maintenance buildings, storage buildings and similar facilities. Adequate government buildings are essential to the proper administration of municipal services. The buildings and land which house the municipal administration and legislative staff and personnel must be sufficient to adequately serve the proposed development considering any increase in staff requirements necessary to serve the proposed development. Adequacy of such government buildings is a precondition to the approval of any development permit. 
2.  Libraries are an essential part of the educational and cultural enrichment of the community and facilities must be adequate to serve the entire population of residents, including new residents created by proposed development. These facilities must be sufficient to meet the needs of residents who will reside in new development as a condition of any development permit. 
3.  The provision of adequate general government buildings and library facilities is essential for the existing/achieved level of service (LOS) for the citizens of the City of Parkland. Without the imposition of an impact fee, the city will either, have to utilize additional general fund revenues to serve the demands of new development or experience a declining level of service as the current inventory of infrastructure serves additional new development. The impact fees set forth herein are based upon the study conducted by Tindale-Oliver & Associates, Inc., dated November 9, 2011, and is based upon recent and localized data. The impact fees are designed to represent the new development's proportionate share of the capital costs associated with providing general government buildings and library facilities infrastructure capacity to serve the new development. The Florida Legislature has found in F.S. § 163.31801, as amended from time to time, that impact fees are an important source of revenue for local government to use in funding the infrastructure necessitated by new growth. The purpose of this impact fee is to assure new development pays its fair share for infrastructure which is necessitated by new growth and that the fees paid will benefit the new growth. 
4.  For the purposes of the government building and library impact fees, a building shall be considered any structure having a roof and four (4) walls or used or built for the shelter or enclosure of person, animals, chattels, or property of any kind. 
5.  General government buildings impact fees. A general government buildings impact fee is imposed on all residential and nonresidential buildings constructed in the City of Parkland. Any application for a building permit in the City of Parkland subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be subject to the assessment of this fee. The impact fees shall be paid prior to receiving any building permits for a residential or nonresidential building in the City of Parkland and shall be paid based upon the schedule set forth below. The fees shall be paid by the party applying for the building permit. No building permit shall be issued unless an impact fee imposed herein has been paid. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the fees are not refundable.

7.  Exemptions. The following shall be exempted from the obligation to pay general government buildings and library facilities impact fees: 
a.  Alteration, expansion or replacement of an existing nonresidential building where the use of the structure is not changed or interior square footage is not increased; or the alteration, expansion or replacement of any existing residential building where interior square footage is not increased by more than thirty-three (33) percent for a residential building. 
b.  Government or public facilities owned by the federal, state, county or city government or the South Florida Water Management District where the building or facility is related to the operation of those entities. 
c.  Full or partial replacement of buildings destroyed by fire or act of God. 
M.  Adequacy of multipurpose trails and pedestrian circulation systems. 
1.  The applicant shall provide a multipurpose system of access parallel to roads identified in the Broward County Trafficways Plan or shown in the city's transportation element. Where feasible, the trail system may be placed in the right-of-way as a separate area for use by pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian traffic. Where not feasible in the right-of-way, the applicant shall dedicate the necessary property and construct the trail system abutting its property. To the extent feasible the trail shall contain the following elements: 
a.  An eight-foot-wide path (either grass or mulch) for use by equestrian traffic; and 
b.  A six-foot-wide concrete sidewalk. 
2.  In addition, connectors or links from the trafficways to parks, schools and other community facility land uses in the city shall be dedicated and constructed to the extent they are adjacent to the development in question. In order to provide a complete circulation system for the residents of the city prior to final plat approval or site plan approval, the developer shall designate and reserve for public use the necessary right-of-way and bond for the construction of the multipurpose recreational system necessary to provide access to the development along the rights-of-way set forth above. This dedication and construction requirement shall be set forth in the staff report to the planning and zoning board and the city commission. 
3.  Where an applicant claims that dedication or construction of the trail system or sidewalk as required herein is not feasible, not properly applied to applicant's development, or in any other way unenforceable, the applicant shall file an appeal directed specifically to this requirement with the planning and zoning director. The appeal shall set forth the complete basis, both factual and legal, for the request for relief from the requirement or other claim of entitlement to relief, exemption, or nonapplication of this provision, and shall be in accordance with the procedures for appeals of administrative decisions provided in section 55-1510, administrative appeals. Where the application must be approved by the city commission, the appeal shall be taken prior to city commission review of the application. In such case, the hearings of the development order application shall be suspended until such time as the administrative appeal is complete. 
N.  Consideration of impact on environmentally sensitive lands. If a proposed development includes all or any part of any lands identified as environmentally sensitive by the city's comprehensive plan or other adopted plan, whether said identification be site specific or by the inclusion of certain identified vegetation, the applicant shall submit to the city an environmental impact report identifying the effects that the proposed development would have on the unique natural qualities and resources of the area. The report shall be prepared in accordance with procedures and standards established by the planning and zoning director. The application for plat or site plan approval may be approved subject to conditions established by the city commission which have been determined to be necessary to minimize any adverse environmental impact to be caused by the proposed development. 
O.  Consideration of impact on aquifer recharge. If a proposed development is located in a potable water well field cone of influence as identified by the city's comprehensive plan, the applicant shall design the development in a manner to protect the public water supply. Development shall follow the applicable SFWMD and Broward County standards. The proposed development shall be designed to provide adequate areas for the construction and maintenance of a water management system to serve the proposed development in a manner which conforms to sound engineering standards and principles. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 35-20. - Impact fee general provisions. 
A.  Annual adjustment of fees. 
1.  The city manager shall annually adjust the impact fees schedules provided herein by indexing the schedule to inflation as defined by the Engineering News Record, "Construction Cost Index," but no increase shall exceed five (5) percent in any year without a recalculation of fees and amendment to this chapter. The first indexing calculation adjustment shall occur during 2012-2013 budget year using the construction cost index for the previous budget year. The adjusted impact fee schedule shall be on file with the department of planning and zoning and city clerk. 
2.  Unless otherwise directed by the city commission, any adjustments to the general government buildings and library facilities impact fees made pursuant to this section, shall be effective October 1 of each calendar year. 
3.  If the construction cost index is discontinued or revised, such other government index or computation with which it is replaced shall be used in order to obtain substantially the same result as would be obtained if the index had not been discontinued or revised. 
B.  Appeals. Any decision relative to the imposition of any impact fee may be appealed by the feepayer to the city commission where it is claimed that the fee or any expenditure violates this chapter, any state or federal law or a constitutional or other established right. The appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the act which is the subject of the appeal. The appeal shall be filed in writing and delivered to the city clerk prior to the end of the thirty-day period set forth above. The appeal shall set forth all the facts, argument and law believed to be relevant to the appeal and the specific relief requested. The city commission shall hear the appeal within forty-five (45) days of delivery and may either grant the relief requested, deny the relief requested or fashion such relief as is deemed just and proper. 
C.  Accounting. The city shall provide for an annual accounting in reporting of all impact fee collections and expenditures. Said revenues and expenditures shall be contained in a separate accounting fund specifically created for the purpose of infrastructure needs and capital equipment for the specific impact fee collected. Any administrative charges related to the collection of impact fees shall be solely based upon actual cost. 
D.  Audit. The annual audit of financial statements of the City of Parkland that are submitted to the auditor general shall include an affidavit signed by the chief financial officer of the city stating that the city has complied with the requirements of F.S. § 163.31801, as amended from time to time.

Sec. 35-30. - Traffic study review process. 
    In the event that a traffic study is required, same shall be reviewed by a professional traffic engineer as a cost recovery item pursuant to article XI "cost recovery program" of chapter 2, "administration," chargeable to the applicant. The review shall determine the accuracy and completeness of the study or other outstanding traffic issues not properly addressed by the applicant. The failure of the traffic study to evidence compliance with all city requirements shall be grounds for denial of a rezoning, plat, master plan, or site plan. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 35-40. - Impact analysis report. 
A.  [Impact analysis report.] An impact analysis report meeting the requirements of this section shall be submitted to the city in conjunction with an application for any development order for rezoning, plat approval, master plan or site plan approval. 
B.  Review procedure. 
1.  The impact analysis report shall be submitted to the planning and zoning director by the owner or authorized agent of the owner of the parcel of land which is the subject of the application for development approval. The impact analysis report for the parcel of land which is the subject of the application for development approval shall be revised as necessary in conjunction with the subsequent requests for development approval for that parcel of land pursuant to this section to reflect the facts and circumstances applicable to that time. 
2.  The planning and zoning director shall prepare an administrative report, in accordance with the procedures set forth in of this section, on the application for development approval and the impact analysis report and shall transmit both reports to the planning and zoning board.

(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 35-50. - Proportionate fair-share mitigation for local roadways. 
A.  Applicability. In order to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, there shall be a program known as the proportionate fair-share mitigation program (the "proportionate fair-share mitigation program"), as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(5). The fair-share mitigation program shall apply to all developments in the city that have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy city transportation concurrency. 
B.  Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
1.  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
2.  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
3.  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(5). 
4.  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, rights-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred. The cost shall be based upon the cost estimate contained in the capital improvement element ("CIE") as determined by the public works department. Where such information is not available, improvement cost shall be determined using the following method: 
a.  If the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be based on an engineer's certified cost estimate provided by the applicant and approved by the planning director and city engineer. 
b.  If the city has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site-related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at one hundred twenty (120) percent of the most recent assessed value by the county property appraiser or, at the option of the applicant, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city. The applicant shall supply a drawing (both hard copy and electronic version) and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the city estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. Prior to purchase or acquisition of any real estate or acceptance of donations of real estate intended to be used for the proportionate fair-share, public or private partners should contact the Florida Department of Transportation ("FDOT") for essential information about compliance with federal law and regulations. 
C.  Proportionate fair-share agreements ("agreements"). 
1.  No proportionate fair share agreement will be effective until approved by the city commission. The city commission shall approve proportionate fair share agreements if it is in the best interest of the public safety, health and welfare of the city. 
2.  Upon the applicant's execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement, project approval and issuance of the first development order, the applicant shall receive a certificate of concurrency. Should the applicant fail to apply for a building permit within eighteen (18) months of the execution of the agreement, then the fair-share agreement shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to reapply. 
3.  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be nonrefundable unless a development order is abandoned following approval of an applicant's formal request to rescind approval of the applicant's preliminary or final development order, or the application expires, and the funds paid for the proportionate fair share contribution, including any impact fee credits, have not been used for their intended purpose, and no development has occurred on the applicant's proposed development site. 
4.  All developer improvements authorized under this section must be completed prior to issuance of the first development permit, or as otherwise established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. Any required improvements shall be completed before issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy. 
5.  Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fair-share agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the first development order or recording of the final plat. 
6.  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order may be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
7.  The city may enter into proportionate fair-share agreements for selected improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility. 
8.  Proportionate fair-share agreements shall contain a provision setting forth the amount of impact fee credit if applicable. 
9.  No proportionate fair-share agreement or development agreement shall be amended by the applicant, or by any agency, except by application by the applicant, or by a government agency desiring an amendment, to the planning director to amend the agreement, which application shall be reviewed by the city's development review committee and which application shall be properly noticed and heard by the planning and zoning board and city commission through the same process established for amendment of the application with which the development agreement is associated. 
10.  Independent negotiations of changes in proportionate fair-share agreements or development agreements outside of the process established in this subsection is hereby prohibited. Such agreements shall not be amended by other agreements required, authorized, or otherwise permitted by state law and this Code. Reviewing agencies are required to address their concerns to the development review committee, and shall not postpone their participation to a time after the development proposal is approved. 
11.  The city attorney shall review all proposed amended proportionate fair-share agreements and all proposed amended development agreements for legal sufficiency, and ensure that they are legally enforceable before they are presented to the city commission for approval. The applicant is responsible for all fees associated with the city attorney reviewing all agreements. Separate agreements that are not titled proportionate fair-share agreements or development agreements shall be consistent with the approved proportionate fair-share agreement and development agreement, and shall not be used to amend an approved proportionate fair share agreement or development agreement outside of the process herein established. 
D.  Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
1.  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the city's CIE, or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. At the discretion of the city, proportionate fair-share revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the capacity project from which the proportionate fair-share revenues were derived. 
2.  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIE, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same roadway that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements in subparagraph 3. 
3.  If the funds allocated for the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the city's CIE are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the CMS, the city may still enter into a binding proportionate fair-share agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair-share is calculated if the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one (1) or more improvements which will, in the opinion of the governmental entity or entities maintaining the transportation facilities, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. The improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fair-share component must be adopted into the five-year capital improvements schedule of the comprehensive plan at the next annual capital improvements element update. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 35-60. - Limitations, agreements and security for development review requirement. 
A.  Limitations on required dedications; money in lieu of dedications. 
1.  The city commission shall determine the reasonable proportion of any property to be developed that shall be granted, dedicated or reserved to the public. Such determinations shall be based upon a finding of a rational relationship between the required dedication, grant or reservation and the anticipated needs of the community taking into account the immediate and direct impact of the proposed development and the long-term impact of continued approval of additional developments on necessary services and facilities in the affected geographical area. Any specific dedication requirements set forth in this section shall be a general standard or guideline and, in a proper factual situation and after a specific request made pursuant to this section, may be reduced by the city commission to comply with this section. Any request to reduce the dedication requirement contained herein shall be submitted by the applicant in writing within ten (10) days of receipt of the final administrative report. The request shall contain an explanation of the basis for the reduction and the applicant's proposed dedication level. The city commission shall consider the request when it acts on the development order application. 
2.  The amount of money required to be deposited with the city in lieu of dedication requirements shall be determined pursuant to the specific standards set forth in this section. The use of such funds will be restricted to the acquisition, expansion and development of service facilities for new users in a manner consistent with all requirements of the constitutions of the United States and the State of Florida and all applicable laws. Any monies required pursuant to this section shall be deposited with the city prior to the issuance of a building permit unless otherwise provided in an impact agreement as hereinafter provided. 
3.  When an application for a development permit is made by a governmental agency for the construction of a public building, the city commission may waive, upon a request therefor, dedications of land, payments of money in lieu thereof or other fees required by this section if the city commission finds that the proposed building will serve a public purpose and promote the public health, safety and welfare. 
B.  Impact agreement. 
1.  In lieu of the dedication of lands or payment of fees in lieu of dedication as calculated under the specific standards of this section, any applicant may propose to enter into an impact agreement with the city designed to establish just and equitable fees or their equivalent and standards for service need appropriate to the circumstances of the specific development proposed. Such an agreement may include but shall not be limited to provisions which: 
a.  Provide a schedule and method for the payment of the fees or the dedication of land in a manner appropriate to the particular circumstances of the proposed development in lieu of the requirements for the payment and depositing of fees or dedication of land otherwise set forth in this section. 
b.  Provide restrictions on the use of the deposited fees that differ from those otherwise set forth in this section provided that the parties to the agreement are satisfied that the fees will be used in a manner that benefits residents of the new users in the city. 
2.  Any agreement proposed by a developer pursuant to this section shall be presented to the city commission prior to the issuance of a building permit for a principal building. Any such agreement may provide for execution by mortgagees, lienholders or contract purchasers in addition to the landowner and may permit any party to record such agreement only if it finds that the agreement will apportion the burden of expenditure for new facilities in a just and equitable manner consistent with all requirements of the constitutions of the United States and the State of Florida and all applicable laws. 
3.  All impact fees collected pursuant to the City of Parkland Development Regulations shall be placed in separate funds for each specific type of impact fee. The finance director shall annually provide an accounting of all collections and expenditures within each separate accounting fund. Impact fees collections shall be segregated from other funds of the city. The city shall annually provide for an audit of impact fee funds, revenues and expenditures in a manner consistent with Florida law and annually the chief financial officer shall execute and affidavit that the city has complied with the annual requirements of the Florida Impact Fee law. 
C.  Appeals. Any decision relative to the imposition of any impact fee imposed may be appealed by the feepayer to the city commission where it is claimed that the fee or any expenditure violates this section, any state or federal law or a constitutional or other established right. The appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the act which is the subject of the appeal. The appeal shall be filed in writing and delivered to the city clerk prior to the end of the thirty-day period set forth above. The appeal shall set forth all the facts, argument and law believed to be relevant to the appeal and the specific relief requested. The city commission shall hear the appeal within forty-five (45) days of delivery and may either grant the relief requested, deny the relief requested or fashion such relief as is deemed just and proper. 
D.  Accounting. The city shall provide for an annual accounting in reporting of all impact fee collections and expenditures. Said revenues and expenditures shall be contained in a separate accounting fund specifically created for the purpose of infrastructure needs and capital equipment for the specific impact fee collected. Any administrative charges related to the collection of impact fees shall be solely based upon actual cost. 
E.  Audit. The annual audit of financial statements of the City of Parkland that are submitted to the auditor general shall include an affidavit signed by the chief financial officer of the city stating that the city has complied with the requirements of F.S. § 163.31801, as amended from time to time with respect to all impact fees imposed in these regulations. 
F.  Expenditure of funds. The city shall expend, or commit for expenditure, any impact fees received within seven (7) years of payment; if not expended or committed within that time frame the fees shall be returned to the feepayer upon request of the feepayer provided said request is made within three (3) months of the conclusion of the seven-year period and provided said refund contains an affidavit that the person requesting the refund is the owner of the property on behalf of which the impact fee was paid, together with evidence of payment of the fee. All funds expended shall be used to benefit the development which paid the funds. Funds shall only be used for the acquisition, expansion or improvement of buildings, structures or real property, capital facilities, or equipment made necessary by the new development and needed to mitigate the impact of new development. 
G.  Exemptions. The following shall be exempted from the obligation to pay any impact fee provided for in this land development code: 
1.  Alteration, expansion or replacement of an existing nonresidential building where the use of the structure is not changed or interior square footage is not increased; or the alteration, expansion or replacement of any existing residential building or commercial or industrial building where interior square footage is not increased by more than thirty-three (33) percent; provided that if any such building has already paid an impact fee for a specific city facility, then the impact fee for that facility for such expansion shall be prorated to account only for the increase in square footage. 
2.  Government or public facilities owned by the federal, state, county or city government or the South Florida Water Management District where the building or facility is related to the operation of those entities. 
3.  Full or partial replacement of buildings destroyed by fire or act of God (provided the square footage is not increased by more than thirty-three (33) percent). 
H.  Installation of improvements. 
1.  All improvements required from the developer as a condition to the approval of an application for a development permit shall be installed and completed before the issuance of a building permit. Any water, sewer, drainage or irrigation lines proposed or required to be constructed within the paved portion of a proposed road right-of-way shall be installed and completed before acceptance of any proposed or required road improvements by the city. 
2.  As an alternative to all required improvements being installed and completed prior to the issuance of a building permit and provided that all other applicable requirements of this section are met, the applicant may provide, in a form acceptable to the city, a cash bond, a surety bond executed by a company authorized to do business in the State of Florida, an irrevocable letter of credit or a negotiable certificate of deposit or escrow account in sufficient amount to ensure the completion of all required improvements within a reasonable period of time or before the issuance of certificates of occupancy as required by the commission and expressed in the bond or other security. 
a.  The city is authorized to enforce such bonds, security deposits or other collateral agreements by appropriate legal proceedings. If the required improvements have not been completed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or as otherwise specifically indicated in the terms of such bond or other security, the city may thereupon declare the bond or other security to be in default. In addition to the city's authority to enforce agreements under this subsection, no certificate of occupancy shall be issued prior to the actual construction and installation of improvements provided for in the agreement unless expressly authorized in the agreement. 
b.  With respect to improvements required by this section where such improvements are required by and bonded to any appropriate unit of local government, the city shall not require duplicate bonds or additional bonds if the city is listed as an additional obligee unless it determines that the bond or security already required is inadequate to assure completion of such required improvements. Where such improvements are not required to be bonded to any other appropriate unit of government, said security shall be payable to the city. Provided, however, with respect to improvements that will be installed, owned and maintained by any other unit of local government, the city shall not require bonds or security. 
c.  The amount necessary to secure required paving, grading and drainage improvements shall be based upon approved plans for those improvements necessary for the portion of the development for which an application for a development permit has been filed and a registered professional engineer's cost estimate submitted by the applicant and approved by the city. Required improvement plans shall conform to all applicable standards. The construction plans shall be approved by the city engineer, and all necessary permits shall be obtained. The applicant shall provide security in an amount which is twenty (20) percent greater than the estimated cost of the required improvements. No security shall be accepted nor construction commenced until the provisions set forth in this subsection have been satisfied. 
d.  The amount necessary to secure required pavement markings and signing improvements shall be based upon approved plans for those improvements. The pavement markings and signing improvement plans shall conform to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Services. No security shall be accepted nor construction commenced until the provisions set forth in this subsection have been satisfied. 
I.  [Agreements.] The city commission is authorized to enter into developers agreements as provided for in F.S. §§ 163.3221 through 163.3241, as amended from time to time, and the city adopts the requirements set forth therein for such agreements.

Provided that the city commission finds that the applicant has demonstrated good cause for the delay in obtaining building permits and the applicant is not in violation of any condition of the site plan approval, a six-month extension of the site plan approval period may be granted. 
H.  Site plan amendment. Modifications to an approved site plan must be submitted pursuant to the review and approval procedure required for an initial site plan application, unless the planning and zoning director determines that the modification does not constitute a substantial change from the previous approval, and qualifies for city commissioner call-up procedure pursuant to section 30-10, administration; generally applicable procedures. 
I.  Continuing obligation to comply with conditions of approval. All conditions that the city commission makes part of approval of a site plan shall be deemed requirements of this Code; such requirements shall be binding. All representations, drawings, elevations, or other submissions made as part of an approved site plan shall also be deemed Code requirements. The violation or failure to adhere to an approved site plan in strict compliance with the above, or the failure to maintain all landscaping and building facades in accordance with the approved site plan shall be a violation of this Code. Should the developer who obtains site plan approval, and/or a homeowners association who has authority over any area within the site plan approval, execute a maintenance agreement related to the site plan property or abutting swales or medians, then that maintenance agreement shall be deemed part of the site plan approval, and the failure to comply with said agreement in each and every respect shall be deemed a violation of this section. In addition, violation of any requirement of a rezoning ordinance, master plan, plat, or site plan by a developer having unified control over any portion of the property subject to the rezoning ordinance, master plan, plat, or site plan shall also be grounds for the city to withhold all development permits and suspend existing development permits until the violation is cured. All agreements entered into by an applicant related to a rezoning, master plan, plat or site plan shall be considered requirements of said approval and a violation of said agreement shall be treated the same as a violation of this Code in the manner set forth above. Where a homeowner's association has succeeded the developer of a development subject to a master plan, site plan, or maintenance agreement, the homeowner's association shall be responsible for all requirements of the master plan, site plan or maintenance agreement.

Sec. 45-70. - Procedure. 
A.  DRC and PZB review. After review by the DRC and the planning and zoning director, the application for preliminary plat approval shall be forwarded to the planning and zoning board for consideration. The planning and zoning board shall determine whether an application for approval of a plat is in conformity with the standards and requirements of this article, the comprehensive plan, and all other applicable requirements of the land development code. The board shall recommend approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval of the preliminary plat. 
B.  City commission review. The city commission shall either approve, approve with modifications or conditions, or deny the preliminary subdivision plat after considering the recommendation of the planning and zoning board and all aspects of the plat necessary to meet all applicable requirements of the land development code and the comprehensive plan of the city. The preliminary plat submitted for city commission review and approval shall have incorporated all changes or modifications, as required by the planning director, DRC, and planning and zoning board, to make the preliminary plat conform to the requirements of this article and to the conditions of final plat approval. 
C.  Effective period and expiration. 
1.  Preliminary plat approval by the city commission signifies that the plat satisfies all city land development code requirements for plats, and that the city accepts any right-of-way and easement dedications shown on the plat. The plat does not become effective until it is recorded after approval by the Broward County Board of County Commissioners. Plat approval by the city commission does not authorize construction, but is a prerequisite to a site plan approval becoming effective, and to issuance of building permits. 
2.  Once the Broward County Board of County Commissioners approves the preliminary plat application, a final plat application shall be submitted, along with all fees as are prescribed in the land development fee schedule, as amended from time to time, and as required in the land development code and any cost recovery ordinance or resolution in addition to filing three (3) full-size copies and fifteen (15) reduced-sized copies of the final plat with the planning and zoning director, together with one (1) copy of the final plat application, or as otherwise provided on the planning and zoning department application submittal checklist. A final plat application shall be reviewed and approved administratively if there are no changes from the preliminary plat to the final plat. If changes have been made subsequent to preliminary plat approval, the planning and zoning director shall determine whether the final plat will be processed using the city commission call-up procedure pursuant to subsection 30-10.J.2., or whether the final plat must be considered by the planning and zoning board and city commission via the public hearing process of subsection 30-10.J.1. 
3.  Approval of a final plat shall expire eighteen (18) months from the date of approval if the final plat is not recorded. The city may, after the eighteen (18) months, require complete reconsideration of all or any part of an expired final subdivision plat. However, city plat approval shall be deemed to have expired when the plat has expired under the Broward County Land Development Code. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015)

Sec. 50-40. - Land development code text amendments. 
    Text amendments to this chapter shall be consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan, as may be amended from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 50-50. - Zoning in progress; hold on permits and licenses. 
    During the period of time that the city commission is considering either an amendment to the land development code or an amendment to the official zoning map, no permit(s) or development order(s) of any kind shall be issued if issuance would result in the nonconforming or unlawful use of the subject property should the text amendment or zoning map amendment be adopted by the city commission. 
A.  The period of time of zoning in progress shall begin on the earlier of: 
1.  Publication of a notice of a public hearing before the city commission to consider a resolution declaring zoning in progress; or 
2.  The planning and zoning board has held its initial public hearing on the text amendment or zoning map change.

(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 50-60. - Reserve units and flexibility units. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide a procedure whereby the number of dwelling units permitted on a plot or parcel of land may be increased in certain specific situations and subject to certain conditions in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Code and, particularly, the implementation section of the City of Parkland future land use element. Reserve units have been established to allow the city to provide an incentive for quality development and for the dedication of land or the payment of fees in lieu of the dedication of land for municipal purposes when such dedications and payments are in excess of those ordinarily required pursuant to the applicable provisions of city and county law. For the purposes of this section and other relevant sections of the Code, the term "reserve units" shall have the same meaning as provided in the Broward County Land Use Plan. Rearrangement of land uses and residential densities within a flexibility zone may require recertification by the Broward County Planning Council; in such case, the application of flexibility shall not be effective until such recertification. 
B.  Consistency with plan. In evaluating the application for reserve units, the city shall consider the proposal's consistency with the goals and objectives of the city land use plan; the purpose of the reserve unit concept as stated in said plan; the characteristics of the surrounding area; the characteristics of the proposed development; the community need for the type of development proposed; the ability of the city, county and other applicable agencies to provide services for the additional dwelling units and the type and extent of the dedication for municipal purposes proposed by the application. 
C.  BCLUP provisions. Allocation of flexibility units, in accordance with section IV.B., "Residential Use," of the Broward County Land Use Plan, shall be subject to Objective 1.12 of the city's future land use element, and Policies 1.01.03, 1.01.04, 1.02.01, 1.02.02, 2.04.04, 2.04.05, 3.01.06 and 3.02.02 of the Broward County Land Use Plan, as may be amended from time to time and the rules and regulations prescribed by the Broward County Planning Council in Article 2 of the Administrative Rules Document as may be amended from time to time. 
D.  Timing. An application for flexibility or reserve units shall be filed in conjunction with an application for rezoning. The application for residential flexibility or reserve units shall include the number of dwelling units permitted by the current zoning and the number of reserve units requested. 
1.  The application for flexibility reserve units shall be reviewed along with the rezoning application by the planning and zoning board and the city commission. An approval of the rezoning application shall also be an approval of the application for flexibility or reserve units. A denial of the rezoning application site plan shall also be a denial of the application for flexibility or reserve units. 
2.  An application for flexibility or reserve units may be approved by the city commission with conditions and stipulations. An approval of an application for flexibility or reserve units with such conditions and stipulations as may be approved by the city commission shall be evidenced by an agreement which shall be signed by the city and applicant; and such agreement may, at the option of the applicant or the city, be recorded in the public records. 
3.  Upon approval of the application for flexibility or reserve units, the city shall reduce the number of flexibility or reserve units available for use elsewhere by the number of reserve units approved in connection with the relevant application; and the city shall inform the Broward County Planning Council of such action. 
E.  [Application for commercial flexibility.] An application for commercial flexibility in areas designated residential on the city's certified land use plan shall be filed in conjunction with an application for rezoning and shall be limited to five (5) percent of the area designated for residential use on the city's certified land use plan. The commercial shall be limited to neighborhood office or retail sales of merchandise or services and the parcel shall be limited to ten (10) acres in size.

ARTICLE 55. - RELIEF AND APPEAL PROCEDURES 
DIVISION 5. - VARIANCES 

Sec. 55-510. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to provide for the establishment of procedures and guidelines for the hearing of appeals from any decision of an administrative official relative to the enforcement of the requirements of this chapter and the authorization of variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 55-520. - Variance application process. 
    Upon receipt of an application for a variance, the planning and zoning director shall determine whether the variance may be considered and processed as an administrative variance pursuant to division 10 of this section, and shall schedule the variance for review and processing accordingly. Variances shall be processed and noticed pursuant to section 30-10, administration; generally applicable procedures. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 55-530. - Variance standards, guidelines and review criteria. 
A.  Burden of proof. The burden of proof that the conditions for a variance exist shall be on the applicant. 
B.  Landscaping variances. Variances from provisions of article 95, landscaping and vegetation, are subject to the criteria of section 95-1575, variances. 
C.  Sign variances. Variances from the provisions of article 100, signage, are subject to the criteria of section 100-560, variances. 
D.  [Additional criteria.] A variance from all other provisions of this land development code are subject to the following criteria unless otherwise specified in this chapter, and shall not be granted unless and until the city commission determines that: 
1.  Special conditions and circumstances exist affecting the land, structure or building involved preventing the reasonable use of said land, structure or building. 
2.  The circumstances which cause the hardship are peculiar to the property or to such a small number of properties that they clearly constitute a marked exception to other properties in the district. 
3.  The literal interpretation of the provision of the land development code would deprive the applicant of a substantial property right that is enjoyed by other property owners in the district. (It is of no importance whatever that the denial of the variance might deny to the property use in a more profitable way or to sell it at a greater profit than is possible under the terms of this chapter.) 
4.  The hardship is not self-created or the result of mere disregard for or ignorance of the provisions of this land development code. 
5.  The variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the property, and that the variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this land development code and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
E.  Conditions and safeguards. In granting a variance, the city commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards as are, in their opinion, necessary to protect the public interest. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. 
F.  Use variances not authorized. Under no circumstances shall the city commission grant a variance to permit a use not generally permitted in the district involved or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this land development code in said district or grant a variance increasing the residential density permitted in said district. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 55-540. - Variance application requirements. 
A.  Application requirements. Variance requests shall contain information sufficient in detail to reasonably apprise the planning and zoning director, the planning and zoning board and the city commission of the nature and substance of the proposed variance. Variance requests shall be filed by written application to the planning and zoning department, which application shall contain the following, or as otherwise required on the planning and zoning department application submittal checklist: 
1.  A legal description of the subject property with a current sealed land survey prepared by a registered land surveyor. 
2.  A detailed description and justification of the proposed variance stating how the criteria for a variance have been met and be accompanied by the processing fee. 
3.  Dimensioned plans showing the improvements that are the subject of the variance request. 
4.  The person filing the application must be the property owner or an agent of the owner. Proof of ownership must be provided. If the applicant is other than the owner of record, a power of attorney from the owner of record to the applicant shall accompany the application affirming that the owner has granted full authority to the applicant to apply for the relief requested in the application. If the applicant is an attorney who is a member of the Florida Bar who is acting on behalf of the owner of record, no power of attorney shall be required, but the application shall be signed by the attorney who shall indicate his or her representative capacity.

(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
DIVISION 10. - ADMINISTRATIVE VARIANCES 

Sec. 55-1010. - Authorized administrative variances. 
    The planning and zoning director may administratively approve the variances for structural encroachments into setbacks of no more than five (5) percent of the setback requirement provided the structural encroachment does not encroach upon an easement without authorization of the easement holder(s). 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 55-1020. - Conditions of approval. 
    The planning and zoning director may impose such conditions in a development order granting an administrative variance as are necessary to accomplish the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan and this section, including, but not limited to, limitations on size, bulk, location, requirements for landscaping, buffering, lighting, and provision of adequate ingress and egress. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 55-1030. - Criteria for granting administrative variances. 
    When granting an administrative variance, the planning and zoning director shall make one (1) or more of the following findings: 
A.  Special and unique conditions exist which are peculiar to the applicant's case and which are not generally applicable to the property located in the zoning district; 
B.  The special and unique conditions are not directly attributable to the actions of the applicant; 
C.  The literal interpretation of this land development code, as applied to the applicant, would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by the owners of other property in the zoning district; 
D.  The variance granted is the minimum variance necessary for the applicant to make reasonable use of the property; 
E.  Granting the variance is not detrimental to the public welfare, or injurious to property or improvements in the zoning district or neighborhood involved; and 
F.  Granting the variance is not contrary to the objectives of the comprehensive plan of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 55-1040. - Procedure. 
A.  Determination of consistency with criteria. The planning and zoning director shall evaluate the application and determine whether the application satisfies the criteria for the granting of administrative variances. If the director finds in the negative, the applicant must proceed with a variance application pursuant to division 5 of this section. The director shall prepare a notice of intent to approve or deny the administrative variance. 
B.  Notice of intent to approve. If the director finds that the administrative variance request complies with the criteria in section 55-1030, criteria for granting administrative variances, the director shall mail the notice to the applicant and all owners of all property within five hundred (500) feet of the property which is the subject of the administrative variance. The applicant shall furnish mailing labels and postage in accordance with the planning and zoning department's specifications, accompanied by a sworn affidavit attesting that the labels include the required mailing addresses. 
C.  Protest procedure. Any property owner who wishes to protest the notice of intent to approve the administrative variance shall submit a written protest (by mail or hand-delivery) to the planning and zoning director no later than the fifteenth day following the date postmarked on the mailed notice. The fifteen-day period shall be referred to as the "protest period." It is the responsibility of the protestor to ensure and confirm that the planning and zoning department receives the protest notice within the protest period. The written protest shall not be valid unless the protestor's name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) are included on the written protest. 
D.  Disposition of application. If the director does not receive a valid written protest within the protest period, the director shall issue a final approval of an administrative variance to the applicant. If the director receives a written protest within the protest period, the protest shall operate to preclude the use of the administrative variance approval process. The application shall then be processed as a non-administrative variance pursuant to division 5 of this section. 
E.  Expiration of administrative variances. An administrative variance shall automatically expire under the following conditions: 
1.  The variance shall expire one (1) year from the date of the written determination by the planning and zoning director granting the administrative variance if a building permit, where required by law, has not been issued in accordance with the plans and conditions upon which the administrative variance was granted; and, 
2.  The administrative variance shall expire if a building permit issued in accordance with the plans and conditions upon which the administrative variance was granted expires and is not renewed pursuant to the applicable provisions regarding renewal of building permits.

(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
DIVISION 20. - PREEMPTIVE RELIEF 

Sec. 55-2010. - Land development code relief procedures. 
A.  Purpose and applicability. In order to address possible unintended violations of federal and state laws, subsequent to implementation of this land development code or its related rules, policies, and procedures in advance of costly litigation, land development code relief may be granted pursuant to this section. 
B.  Application. A person or entity shall request relief under this section prior to filing a lawsuit, by completing a land development code relief request form, which is available from the planning and zoning department. The form shall contain such questions and requests for information as are necessary for evaluating the relief requested. 
C.  Notice. The city shall display a notice on the city public notice bulletin board and shall maintain copies available for review in the city clerk's office. The notice shall advise the public that a request for land development code relief under a federal or state law is pending. The location, date and time of the applicable public hearing shall be included in the notice. Mailed notice shall also be provided to property owners within five hundred (500) feet, if the request for relief is site specific, in accordance with the mail notification procedure provided for variances in section 30-10, administration; generally applicable procedures. 
D.  Application and hearing. The city commission shall have the authority to consider and act on requests for land development code relief submitted to the planning and zoning director. A public hearing shall be held within seventy-five (75) days of receipt by the city of the request for relief at a city commission meeting. A written determination shall be issued by resolution no later than seven (7) days after the conclusion of the public hearing. The determination may: 
1.  Grant the relief requested, 
2.  Grant a portion of the request and deny a portion of the request, or impose conditions upon the grant of the request, or 
3.  Deny the request. Any determination denying the requested relief shall be final, in writing, and shall state the reasons the relief was denied. The final written determination shall be sent to the requesting party by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
E.  Additional information. If necessary, prior to the public hearing, the planning and zoning director may request additional information from the requesting party, specifying in sufficient detail what information is required. In the event a request for additional information is made to the requesting party by the city, the seventy-five (75) day time period to schedule a public hearing shall be extended to ninety (90) days to include the time necessary to seek and review the additional information. The requesting party shall have fifteen (15) days after the date the information is requested to provide the needed information. If the requesting party fails to timely respond with the requested additional information, the city shall notify the requesting party and proceed to public hearing and decision on the application using the original information the applicant provided. 
F.  Criteria. In determining whether the land development code relief request shall be granted or denied, the applicant shall be required to establish: 
1.  The applicant is a potential claimant under a federal or state law; and 
2.  The applicant believes in good faith that the city-through implementation of its land development code-has intentionally or unintentionally violated federal or state law for the reasons stated in the land development code relief request; and 
3.  The applicant satisfies the standard set forth in the applicable federal or state statutes, or legal precedent interpreting the applicable statutes, to establish that the requested relief is required by law. 
G.  Exhaustion required. Completion of the land development code relief procedures of this section shall be a supplement to and not a substitute for any other pre-litigation dispute resolution processes available by law to the city or the applicant. Completion of the land development code relief procedures shall constitute the exhaustion of all administrative remedies available from the city. 
H.  Effect while pending. While an application for land development code relief or appeal of a determination of same is pending before the city, the city will not enforce the subject land development code, rules, policies, and procedures against the property owner, except the city may seek injunctive relief if an imminent threat to the health, safety and welfare of the public is present. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
DIVISION 25. - REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS 

Sec. 55-2510. - Reasonable accommodation procedures. 
A.  Implementation of policy. This section implements the policy of the City of Parkland for processing of requests for reasonable accommodation to its ordinances, rules, policies, and procedures for persons with disabilities as provided by the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.)("FHA") and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Section 12131 et seq.) ("ADA"). For purposes of this section, a "disabled" individual or person is an individual that qualifies as disabled and/or handicapped under the FHA and/or ADA. Any person who is disabled (or qualifying entities) may request a reasonable accommodation with respect to the city's land use or zoning laws, rules, policies, practices and/or procedures (hereinafter, for the purposes of this section, the "land development code") as provided by the FHA and the ADA pursuant to the procedures set out in this section. The city commission shall appoint a special master who shall make final determinations on applications for reasonable accommodations related to relief from land development code regulations. 
B.  Request to be in writing. A request by an applicant for reasonable accommodation under this section shall be made in writing by completion of a reasonable accommodation request form, which form is maintained by (and shall be submitted to) the reasonable accommodation administrator. The reasonable accommodation form shall contain such questions and requests for information as are necessary for processing the reasonable accommodation request. For a reasonable accommodation request involving housing or zoning, the application, shall, at a minimum, require the following information: 
1.  Name and contact information for applicant or applicant's authorized representative; and 
2.  Address of housing or other location at which accommodation is requested; and 
3.  Description of reasonable accommodation required; and 
4.  Description of the accommodation and the specific regulation(s) and/or procedure(s) from which accommodation is sought; and 
5.  Reason(s) the reasonable accommodation may be necessary for the individual(s) with disabilities to use and enjoy the housing or other service; and 
6.  A statement as to whether the applicant is requesting the accommodation in order to house more than three (3) unrelated people in a single-family dwelling; and 
7.  A statement as to whether the applicant is seeking the accommodation in order to make housing and/or provision of housing financially viable, with supporting documentation; and 
8.  A statement as to whether the applicant is seeking the accommodation is therapeutically necessary, with supporting documentation; and 
9.  Proof of satisfactory fire, safety, and health inspections required by F.S. § 397.487, as amended, and other applicable law. 
C.  Medical information; confidentiality. Should the information provided by the disabled individual to the city include medical information or records, including records indicating the medical condition, diagnosis or medical history of the disabled individual(s), such individual(s) may, at the time of submitting such medical information, request that the city, to the extent allowed by law, treat such medical information as confidential information of the disabled individual(s). The city shall thereafter endeavor to provide written notice to the disabled individual(s), and/or their representative, or any request received by the city for disclosure of the medical information or documentation which the disabled individual(s) has previously requested be treated as confidential by the city. The city will cooperate with the disabled individual(s), to the extent allowed by law, in actions initiated by such individual(s) to oppose the disclosure of such medical information or documentation, but the city shall have no obligation to initiate, prosecute or pursue any such action, or to incur any legal or other expenses (whether by retention of outside counsel or allocation of internal resources) in connection therewith, and may comply with any judicial order without prior notice to the disabled individual(s). 
D.  Determination process. 
1.  The special master shall issue a written determination within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of a completed application, except as provided in paragraph 3, below, and may, in accordance with federal law, (1) grant the accommodation request, (2) grant a portion of the request and deny a portion of the request and/or impose conditions upon the grant of the request, or (3) deny the request in accordance with federal law. The reasonable accommodation administrator shall issue a written order on the request which either approves the request, denies the request or approves the request with conditions and/or modifications. If the request is denied, the order shall state the grounds therefore. All written determinations shall give notice of the right to appeal. 
2.  The notice of determination shall be sent to the requesting party (i.e., the disabled individuals or representative) by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
3.  If reasonably necessary to reach a determination on the request for reasonable accommodation, the special master, prior to the end of said sixty-day period, or the city manager or designee may request additional information from the requesting party, specifying in sufficient detail what information is required. The requesting party shall have fifteen (15) days after the date of the request for additional information to provide the requested information. In the event a request for additional information is made, the sixty-day period to issue a written determination shall no longer be applicable, and the special master shall issue a written determination within thirty (30) days after receipt of the additional information or ninety (90) days after the initial receipt of the application, whichever is later. If the requesting party fails to provide all of the requested additional information within said fifteen-day period, the special master or designee shall issue a written notice advising that the requesting party had failed to timely submit the additional information and therefore the request for reasonable accommodation shall be deemed abandoned and/or withdrawn and no further action by the city with regard to said reasonable accommodation request shall be required. 
E.  Criteria for determination. In determining whether the reasonable accommodation request shall be granted or denied, the requesting party shall be required to establish that they are protected under the FHA and/or ADA by demonstrating that they are handicapped or disabled, as defined in the FHA and/or ADA. Further, the requesting party must demonstrate that: 
1.  A physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one (1) or major life activities; a record of having such impairment; or that they are regarded as having such impairment. 
2.  That the proposed accommodations being sought are reasonable and necessary to afford handicapped/disabled persons equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing. The foregoing (as interpreted by the courts) shall be the basis for a decision upon a reasonable accommodation request made by the reasonable accommodation administrator, or designee, or by the city commission in the event of an appeal. 
3.  The requested accommodation would not fundamentally alter the city's zoning scheme. 
The special master may impose conditions or modifications he/she deems necessary to mitigate any factors which would fundamentally alter the residential character of the neighborhood or to protect the public health and safety or are reasonably necessary to assure compliance with his/her order. 
F.  Appeal of determination. Within thirty (30) days after the special master's determination on a reasonable accommodation request is mailed to the requesting party, any other or any order or action of the reasonable accommodation administrator with respect to the application or this section, such applicant may appeal the decision to the city commission. All appeals shall contain a statement containing sufficient detail of the grounds for the appeal. Appeals shall be to the city commission who shall, after public notice and a public hearing, render a determination as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after an appeal has been filed. Where the appeal is based upon a provision of the land development code, the planning and zoning board shall first hold a hearing to make a recommendation on the appeal to the city commission. 
G.  Fees. There shall be no fee imposed by the city in connection with a request for reasonable accommodation under this section or an appeal of a determination on such request to the city commission, and the city shall have no obligation to pay a requesting party's (or an appealing party's, as applicable) attorneys' fees or costs in connection with the request, or an appeal. 
H.  Stay of enforcement. While an application for reasonable accommodation, or appeal or a determination of same, is pending before the city, the city will not enforce the subject zoning ordinance, rules, policies, and procedures against the applicant. 
I.  Miscellaneous provisions. The following general provisions shall be applicable: 
1.  The city shall display a notice in the city's public notice bulletin board (and shall maintain copies available for review in the planning and zoning department, the building/permitting division, and the city clerk's office), advising the public that disabled individuals (and qualifying entities) may request reasonable accommodation as provided herein. 
2.  A disabled individual may apply for a reasonable accommodation on his/her own behalf or may be represented at all stages of the reasonable accommodation process by a person designated by the disabled individual. 
3.  The city shall provide such assistance and accommodation as is required pursuant to FHA and ADA in connection with a disabled person's request for reasonable accommodation, including, without limitation, assistance with reading application questions, responding to questions, completing the form, filing an appeal; and appearing at a hearing, etc., to ensure the process is accessible. 
J.  Revocation of reasonable accommodation. Any reasonable accommodation received shall be deemed revoked if the applicant or the property upon which the accommodation is granted is found in violation of any provision of the order granting the reasonable accommodation by a court of law or by the special master hearing code enforcement cases. 
K.  Recertification. All reasonable accommodation requests approved by the city are valid for no more than two (2) years. Recertification requests must be filed at least ninety (90) days before the conclusion of the end of the two-year period of effectiveness of the reasonable accommodation order. The process for recertification shall follow the same requirements as set forth above for "requests for accommodation", and review of recertification requests shall follow the same procedures as outlined above for new applications. The failure of the applicant to timely apply for annual recertification, or the denial of an application to recertify annually, shall result in the revocation of the approved reasonable accommodation. Recertification requests shall follow the same requirements as set forth above.

    Unless otherwise allowed to continue as a nonconforming use or structure under article 25, nonconforming uses and structures, all existing, proposed and new development or redevelopment and uses of land in the city shall conform strictly to the provisions of this chapter. Except as expressly provided in this chapter, no development or use of land shall be undertaken without prior approval and issuance of a development order or permit.

(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 55-3020. - Criteria for vested rights determination.

A.  A governmental act of development approval was obtained prior to the effective date of these land development regulations or prior to the effective date of an amendment to these land development regulations; 
B.  The property owner has detrimentally relied, in good faith, by making substantial expenditures based upon the governmental act of development approval; 
C.  It would be highly inequitable to deny the property owner the right to complete the development; and 
D.  The adoption of these regulations or any amendments thereto is the cause of the applicant's inability to complete the development. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 55-3030. - Application requirements and procedure. 
A.  Required information. Any property owner claiming to have vested rights under this section must file an application with the planning and zoning director for a vested rights determination within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the initial effective date of any amendment to this land development code. The owner shall request a determination of vested development rights by filing an application with the city upon a form to be provided for that purpose, setting forth the following information: 
1.  The name and address of the applicant; 
2.  A legal description of the property, which is the subject of the application; 
3.  The name, address and telephone number of each owner of the property; 
4.  Identification by specific reference to each provision of the comprehensive plan or land development regulation or other regulation (past or present) which the applicant believes supports the claim to vested development rights and the comprehensive plan provision, land development regulation, or other action (proposed or already taken) of the city which threatens the claimed vested development right; 
5.  The specific vested development right claimed. This shall be a complete statement of the rights claimed by the applicant and the precise relief requested; 
6.  A complete statement of the facts and law (with citations to appropriate statutes or case law where necessary) which the applicant intends to provide in support of the application and which the applicant believes supports the claim; 
7.  Such other relevant information that the planning director may request; 
8.  Such payment of fees as set forth in the land development fee schedule, as amended from time to time; and 
9.  An application pertaining to property owned by more than one (1) person may be executed by any one (1) owner. 
B.  Scheduling commission hearing; distribution of documents to commission members. Upon receipt of the complete application, the city clerk shall set the date and time for a hearing before the city commission and shall distribute to each member of the commission a copy of the application.

At the hearing before the city commission, the applicant may present testimony, and the applicant as well as all other witnesses shall appear and respond under oath to questions by members of the city commission, the planning and zoning director, and the city attorney (or other attorney representing the city), and the applicant may present evidence. The hearing before the city commission shall be recorded and transcribed by a court reporter, who shall provide one (1) copy of the transcript to the city clerk at cost to the applicant. Where the city retains the services of outside counsel to represent either the commission or staff, the applicant shall pay one-half (1/2) the costs of said counsel's fee, including one-half (1/2) of any retainer requested prior to the hearing. 
D.  Commission determination. At the conclusion of the hearing, the city commission shall determine to grant the application in full, grant the application in part or with conditions, or deny the application. In making its determination, the city commission shall be guided by the rule that the right to development of property is found to exist whenever the applicant proves by competent, substantial evidence that under federal or state law, the applicant has vested development rights.

Sec. 60-40. - Standards, guidelines and review criteria. 
    Any use classified as a special exception use must undergo additional review for the satisfaction of standards over and above the standards set forth for permitted uses. Therefore, any proposed special exception use shall demonstrate compliance with the provisions of the land development code and the comprehensive plan. In addition to those criteria, the standards to be applied by the planning and zoning board and the city commission in considering the applications for a special exception use are as follows: 
A.  The compatibility of such use with the existing and permitted use of surrounding properties. An otherwise lawful activity may, because of its location, interfere with the property rights of adjacent landowners by creating an unreasonable disruption to the area by way of increased noise, storage and use of dangerous materials, undesired increase or intensity of development or traffic or other impacts. It is the intent of this article that each application for approval of a special exception use be evaluated in light of the unique characteristics of the neighborhood or area in which it is to be located and the positive and negative effects that it may have on the neighborhood or area, and the community in general. 
B.  Access, traffic generation, road and intersection capacities. Consideration will be given to the design capacity of the roadways and intersections, the particular traffic generation characteristics of the proposed special exception use, including the type of vehicular traffic associated with such use, and traffic generation characteristics of other uses permitted in adjacent zoning districts. 
C.  Availability of and impacts upon the capacity of utilities, community facilities, infrastructure and public services such as police and fire protection, and water and sewer service. 
D.  Compliance with the land development code and conformity to, and compliance with, the stated goals, objectives, policies and land uses established by the city comprehensive plan. 
E.  Whether the proposed use would adversely influence living conditions of the residential neighborhoods affected by the use or impacts directly associated with the use. 
F.  Whether the proposed use would adversely affect property values in the adjacent area. 
G.  Whether the proposed use would be a deterrent to the improvement or development of adjacent property in accordance with existing regulations. 
H.  Any additional factors or considerations which may be reasonably calculated to materially affect public health, safety and welfare. The above factors are to be considered supplemental to and separate from any other development review factors provided for in the land development code and the satisfaction of those requirements shall not be dispositive of whether these supplemental requirements have been met. 
I.  Where the special exception is for a school facility, special consideration shall be given to the following: 
(1)  Whether there are sufficient student drop off areas for motorists that are physically separate from the parking area (supported by a traffic analysis to demonstrate that the size and location of the drop off area are adequate for the facility: and 
(2)  Whether the site plan provides adequate fencing or other security measures to assure the safety of students from drive aisle and parking areas: and 
(3)  Whether the site plan provides adequate additional dedicated parking spaces for buses and provides adequate space and drive isles for use by buses. 
    The applicant shall have the burden of proof as to the standards set forth above.

Sec. 60-60. - Effective period of special exception use permit. 
A.  Expiration. All special exception approvals shall expire unless: 
1.  The applicant submits all development permit applications and construction drawings (if applicable) that are necessary to establish the special exception use within twelve (12) months of city commission approval; and 
2.  The applicant obtains all necessary building and development permits (including payment of all fees) within eighteen (18) months of city commission approval; and 
3.  All building permits remain valid until the project is complete. 
B.  Burden on property owner. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to ensure that a special exception approval does not expire. 
C.  Extensions. The city commission may grant no more than one (1) extension of the time period of special exception approval of up to six (6) months if the applicant submits the extension request within twelve (12) months of the date of city commission approval and the applicant can demonstrate good cause for the delay. Good cause may include, but shall not be limited to, delay caused by governmental action or inaction or other factors beyond the control of the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 60-70. - Requirements; effect of approval; modification. 
A.  Satisfaction of conditions. The use for which a special exception has been granted by the city shall not be commenced until all of the improvements stipulated in the grant of special exception necessary for the orderly use of the property have been accomplished. 
B.  Effect of approval. Approval of a special exception use shall run with the property once established (i.e., not expired or revoked) unless otherwise stipulated as a condition of approval. When a special exception application is for a specified location within a parcel; for example, a bay within a shopping center, the approval shall apply only to the specified location, and not the entire parcel. Any change to the location of the special exception use requires a modification pursuant to subsection D., unless the planning and zoning director determines that the change in location would not result in greater or new impacts to surrounding properties, and thereby qualifies for the city commission call-up procedure pursuant to subsection 30-10.J.2, action by city commission for call-up items. Any such change in the location of a special exception use shall remain subject to the conditions of approval applied to the previously approved location. 
C.  Re-application. Upon denial of an application for special exception, there shall be a two-year waiting period before any applicant may submit an application for the same or substantially similar application and for the same property as that which was initially denied. 
D.  Modification of permit. If the applicant wishes to amend a special exception use approval, the proposed amendment shall be processed and reviewed in accordance with the procedures set forth in this article for new special exception uses.

A.  Required review and approval. 
1.  No building permit shall be issued to erect a building or structure (including signs) or to materially alter a front, rear, or side elevation of any existing building or structure (excluding single-family homes which are not part of a planned community (PUD, PRD or other subdivision developed under unified control) containing more than two (2) lots, without the city commission having first reviewed and approved the proposed project/application for compliance with the city's community appearance standards as set forth herein after review by the DDRP. The DDRP shall provide the CAB with an advisory recommendation for all such projects/applications in accordance with section 75-15. All homes associated with planned unit developments or platted subdivisions with more than two (2) lots shall require compliance with the applicable community appearance standards of this article, and approval by the CAB. Modifications to previously approved CAB applications shall be processed in accordance with the procedures of section 30-100, administration. 
2.  Applicants may obtain CAB approval at either the site plan, master plan (for planned unit developments) or building permit stage in the development review process. To obtain approval at the site plan or master plan stage however, the applicant must provide architectural drawings/elevations and specifications in sufficient detail to enable the CAB to determine compliance with this article. If CAB approval is obtained at the site plan or master plan stage, all subsequent plans and drawings submitted for issuance of a building permit must conform with what was approved at the site plan stage or the applicant will be required to obtain approval of the modifications pursuant to the procedure set forth in section 30-100, administration. 
3.  Applications for building permits for wall signs shall not require CAB approval provided that the CAB has previously approved a uniform sign program for the commercial center where the sign will be located. However if the design of the proposed sign differs in any way from the approved sign program, then a uniform sign plan amendment must be submitted as a CAB application. 
4.  Any repainting of a structure other than a single-family home shall first be approved by the planning and zoning director according to the standards set forth herein before such repainting may commence. The city manager, however, is hereby authorized to promulgate rules applicable to the repainting of structure which may be different from those stated. 
B.  Application requirements. 
1.  It shall be the responsibility of the applicant for a development permit to provide a completed CAB application to permit a determination as to compliance with this article.

Sec. 75-50. - Intent. 
    The intent of the city's community appearance standards is to ensure that all nonresidential developments, residential subdivisions with more than two (2) lots, and multifamily developments are constructed in a quality manner and complement Parkland's existing natural (parklike) and built (small town/village) environment. These standards are not intended to restrict imagination, innovation, or variety, but rather they are to assist in focusing design principles which will result in creative solutions to develop satisfactory visual appearance within the city, preserve taxable values, and promote the public health, safety, and welfare. 
A.  Commercial development. A primary emphasis of any new or expanded commercial development shall be to create an attractive and pedestrian-friendly environment. As such, all new multi-building commercial projects should provide meaningful public gathering spaces (e.g., plazas and courtyards) and walkways as well as other amenities including water bodies, fountains, lush landscaping, decorative lighting, pavers, and other appropriate hardscape. 
B.  Other nonresidential development. A primary emphasis of any other new or expanded nonresidential development shall be to create an attractive development that is compatible and complimentary to existing and future adjacent residential development. 
C.  Residential developments. The primary emphasis of a planned development shall be aesthetic compatibility of the architectural design with the natural (parklike) and small town/village environment of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 75-60. - Desirable general design elements. 
    The city considers the following design features to be desirable elements of all development and the standards and guidelines set forth in subsequent sections of this article are intended to facilitate the incorporation of as many of these features into a proposed project as feasible and appropriate. For new commercial development, it is emphasized that the appearance of a strip center (as defined in section 10-4560, strip centers prohibited) shall be prohibited and shall cause any application to be denied. It is important to note that the images are intended to serve as a general guide and thus need not be followed exactly as depicted. 
A.  Visual compatibility with development on adjacent sites. 
B.  Building scale and mass that is compatible with adjacent or nearby development, especially residential.

C.  Adjacent buildings of different architectural styles shall be made compatible by such means as screens, sight breaks, and materials. 
D.  Attractive landscape transition to adjoining properties shall be provided. 
E.  Multiple buildings in a single project shall create a positive functional relationship to one another. Where possible, multiple buildings within a nonresidential development shall be clustered to achieve a "village" scale. This creates opportunities for plazas and pedestrian areas while preventing long "barracks-like" rows of buildings. When clustering is impractical, a visual link shall be established between buildings with the use of an arcade system, trellis, colonnade, covered walkways, landscaping, enhanced paving, building articulation and detailing, or similar features. 
F.  Orienting some buildings within a multiple-building nonresidential or multiple-family development closer to the street to screen parking in the interior of the site, and provide strong pedestrian connections to buildings is encouraged where appropriate (e.g., does not negatively impact any abutting residential areas). 
G.  If the design of a commercial site does not lend itself to a functional storefront facing a street, all building facades facing streets shall be designed with enhancements comparable to that of the primary facade. Design enhancements may include real and/or faux windows, awnings/pedestrian arcades, outdoor seating/public plaza, landscape features, or other design elements that meet the intent of this subsection. 
H.  Building entrances shall be positioned so they are easily identifiable from the interior drives and parking lots. 
I.  Parking lot areas shall be located away from, and must be well screened and buffered from, any adjacent or nearby residential development.

Sec. 75-90. - Parking area design. 
A.  Large surface parking areas and other expansive areas of paved surfaces should be avoided in favor of a series of smaller parking fields. Smaller parking field can be incorporated by physically separating parking areas with buildings and plazas, and may also be delineated with an on-site circulation system that utilizes uninterrupted drive aisles, landscape islands and planters, pedestrian walkways, or any combination thereof. 
B.  Parking areas shall be fully screened from view from public roads using plantings, building wall extensions, berms, or other innovative design means. 
C.  Designs that provide for on-street parking in front of buildings may be considered if appropriate given the layout of the site. 
D.  Parking lots should have direct pedestrian connections to the building entry points, especially if the parking is located along the side and/or behind the buildings. Designated pedestrian access shall be provided from all parking areas to the primary building entrances. 
E.  Parking lots should be designed to avoid dead-end aisles. 
F.  Parking areas shall be separated from buildings by a landscaped strip or a raised concrete walkway or pedestrian plaza whenever possible. 
G.  Parking aisles should be oriented perpendicular to buildings in order that pedestrians walk parallel to moving cars, and to minimize the need for pedestrians to cross multiple parking aisles and landscape areas. 
H.  The practice of aligning all travel lanes in parking lots in long straight configurations is discouraged. 
I.  Curbed landscaping islands should be used to designate a change in direction of parking stalls and aisles. 
J.  Cross-access easements shall be provided, whenever practical and feasible, between adjacent lots to facilitate the flow of traffic between complementary users. 
K.  Applicants may request that the city consider designs that provide for shared parking between different uses with staggered peak parking demand in order to reduce the total number of spaces within the development. 
L.  Applicants may request that the city consider the use of properly designed grass parking areas for developments that have only periodic parking demand (e.g., places of worship).

A.  Required design elements. All commercial developments with multiple buildings or tenants shall be designed to include one (1) or more of the following features: 
1.  Pedestrian plazas and courtyards that are of such scale, design and/or location to be a focal point of activity and/or interest. Such areas should not just be aesthetically pleasing, but they should also be designed to serve as truly functional and desirable places of public interaction and enjoyment (e.g., providing ample covered/shaded areas). 
2.  Outdoor dining areas and sidewalk cafes that bring activity to plazas and courtyards, optimally placed at the edge of open spaces, or located along building and street frontages. Where feasible, create a sense of enclosure for such outdoor dining areas. 
3.  Walkways and breezeways that provide connections between buildings and other site amenities. When located along storefronts, walkways should be of sufficient width to accommodate potential sidewalk cafes and shall be primarily covered with building overhangs, trellises, awnings, or a combination thereof. 
4.  Water bodies that serve as a site amenity both in terms of design (e.g., size/shape/use of fountains) and interaction with other pedestrian amenities (e.g., outdoor dining areas and walkways). 
5.  A significant architectural landmark feature. 
6.  Restrooms/changing areas. 
B.  Failure to comply; justification required. If the applicant does not propose one (1) or more of these features, a statement must be provided indicating what conditions, if any, inhibit their inclusion in the project. Failure to provide adequate justification for not including the features listed above shall be grounds for denial of applications. 
C.  Open space. Open space areas for pedestrian use shall be aggregated in conspicuous and easily visible areas of high pedestrian activity. 
D.  Pedestrian area enhancements. Commercial developments shall delineate areas designed for pedestrian activity with two (2) or more of the following features:

E.  Landscaping along building facades facing a parking lot or street shall anchor the building to the surrounding environment and soften its appearance. In-ground landscaping should comprise the majority of the landscaping requirement. Raised planters are acceptable when designed to accentuate the architecture and/or enhance pedestrian areas. 
F.  Unity of design shall be achieved by repetition of certain plant varieties and other materials. 
G.  Plant material shall be selected for interest in its structure, texture, and color and for its ultimate growth. Plants that are indigenous to the area and others that will be hardy, harmonious to the design and of good appearance shall be used. Plant material shall be in accordance with the landscape manual maintained by the city. 
H.  Plants shall be protected by appropriate curbs, tree guards, or other devices when susceptible to injury by pedestrian or motor traffic. 
I.  Dense landscaping and/or architectural treatments should be provided to screen unattractive views and features such as storage areas, trash enclosures, utility cabinets and other similar elements. 
J.  Landscaping and accent paving should be used to help define and beautify main project entrances. Entries to multi-tenant projects should be designed as special statements reflective of the character and scale of the project in order to establish identity for tenants, visitors, and patrons. Landscaping should be the predominant component of the design of such entries versus hardscape components such as walls, fountains, and signage. Planting design should have focal points at project entries, plaza areas, and other areas of interest using distinctive planting and/or landscape features. 
K.  Special landscape treatment shall be given to street intersections while taking into account sight-line issues. Improvements should complement driveway entry landscaping and enhance the character/design of the overall development. 
L.  The proposed landscape and irrigation design shall promote water conservation. Water requirements may be reduced by providing for: 
1.  Preservation and reestablishment of native plant communities; 
2.  The use of drought-tolerant, site specific, and shade-producing plants; and 
3.  Design and maintenance of irrigation systems which eliminate waste of water due to over application or loss from damage. 
M.  Trees located within project sites should be properly maintained by pruning from the bottom instead of cutting off the tops. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 75-150. - Exterior lighting. 
A.  Parking area light fixtures should be designed with a concealed/recessed light source that shields light downward and confines light spread within a site's boundaries and does not adversely impact any adjoining residential areas. 
B.  Site lighting should provide consistent levels of illumination, avoiding pockets of very high or low levels of illumination. 
C.  All building entrances and other areas of special security concern should be well lit. 
D.  Adequate and appropriate light levels shall be provided for each site condition. 
E.  Lighting sources shall be color-correct types such as Halogen or metal halide.

H.  The use of light poles that are shorter than the maximums allowed in this code is encouraged, provided that illumination levels meet all intensity and safety requirements. 
I.  Parking lot poles should be located in medians or perimeter buffer areas wherever possible. Landscaping improvements should not conflict with the location of poles. 
J.  Pedestrian-scale lighting, in no case higher than twenty (20) feet above grade, should be provided for walkways, plazas and other areas designed for use by pedestrians. 
K.  Decorative lighting fixtures mounted directly on structures may be allowed when utilized for walkways or plazas near buildings provided the level of illumination is of relatively low-intensity. 
L.  "Wall paks" are permitted only in loading and service areas, and should be down-lit. 
M.  Neon tubing is not acceptable as a building accent or to accentuate a building's form. 
N.  Lighting should be used to highlight entrances, art, terraces, and special landscape features; however, fixtures should be concealed to prevent glare. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 75-160. - Signage for commercial centers. 
A.  The primary function of business signage for any commercial center shall be to identify the location of businesses but not to serve as a supplementary means of advertisement. 
B.  All integrated commercial developments within the city (e.g., multiple tenants or buildings) shall establish a uniform sign program to ensure compatibility between signs throughout the project. 
C.  Such sign programs may provide for the use of on-site wayfinding signs to assist in the location of stores in large commercial centers in accordance with section 100-1530, permanent signs; location, provided said signs are of compatible scale and architectural design. 
D.  Every sign shall be appropriately scaled and proportioned in its visual relationship to buildings and surroundings. 
E.  Every sign shall be designed as an integral architectural element of the building and site to which it principally relates. 
F.  The colors, materials, and lighting of every sign shall be harmonious with the building and site to which it principally relates.

C.  Combine loading docks and service areas between multiple sites. 
D.  Clearly identify service entrances with signs to discourage the use of main entrances for deliveries. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 75-190. - Trash/recycling facilities. 
A.  Trash enclosures and containers shall be sized to accommodate the volume of refuse that is generated. Development design should also take advantage of opportunities to centralize enclosures where there are multiple buildings or users. 
B.  Trash facilities shall be enclosed and landscaped per the requirements of section 95-1525, screening and special landscaping requirements. Enclosure materials and colors shall be consistent with and complementary to the building materials and finishes. 
C.  Trash enclosures shall be located in low-visibility areas. 
D.  Trash enclosures shall be located so not to obstruct drive aisles, pedestrian walkways, and access to parking spaces. They must be located so as to be conveniently accessed by refuse haulers and not infringe on any of the areas noted immediately above. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 75-200. - Maintenance factors. 
A.  Continued good appearance depends upon the extent and quality of maintenance. The choice of materials and their use, together with the types of finishes and other protective measures, must be conducive to easy maintenance and upkeep. 
B.  Materials and finishes shall be selected for their durability and wear as well as for their beauty. Proper measures and devices shall be incorporated for protection against the elements, neglect, damage and abuse. 
C.  Provision for washing and cleaning of building and structures, and control of dirt and refuse, shall be included in the design. Configurations that tend to catch and accumulate debris, leaves, trash, dirt, and rubbish shall be avoided. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 75-210. - Mixed-use supplementary design standards. 
    For the purpose of these guidelines, mixed-use projects are defined as developments which combine retail and service commercial, office, and/or residential uses or structures on a single lot, or as components of a single development. The uses may be combined, either vertically within the same structure or spread horizontally on the site in different areas and structures. The primary design issue related to mixed-use projects is the need to successfully balance the requirements of residential uses, such as the need for privacy and security, with the needs of commercial uses for access, visibility, parking, loading, and possibly extended hours of operation. The following standards are intended to address some of the unique issues associated with mixed-use developments. 
A.  When residential uses are combined with commercial uses, care shall be taken to ensure that adjacent uses will be compatible. For example, apartments above professional offices are a good fit, while apartments above a fast food restaurant will create conflict. 
B.  Vertical integration of uses is preferred. Under those circumstances, development of the ground floor level of a building should encourage pedestrian activity. However, a horizontal separation of uses (e.g., commercial or office development along the front of a property and residential development to the rear) may be appropriate or desirable depending on the size of the site, access, and surrounding property. 
C.  When mixing uses in a horizontal or side-by-side fashion, the backs of uses are often a good location to bring uses together and make a transition with alley access serving residential on one (1) side and commercial on the other. 
D.  Consider placement of commercial equipment and activity areas, such as refrigeration equipment, air handlers, etc., in terms of noise impact on residential uses. 
E.  Separate site access drives and parking facilities shall be provided for residential and nonresidential use. 
F.  When residential and nonresidential uses are provided in the same structure, separate entrances shall be provided for each use. 
G.  Site access drives should incorporate distinctive architectural elements and landscape features to differentiate access to commercial parking areas from residential areas. 
H.  Loading areas and refuse storage facilities should be located as far as possible from residential units and should be completely screened from view of adjacent residential portions of the project. The location and design of trash enclosures should account for potential nuisances and odors. 
I.  Open space intended exclusively for residential use should not be accessible from commercial areas. Open space and courtyards in commercial areas should be accessible to residential occupants, employees, and visitors. 
J.  Public spaces should be designed to encourage the attention and presence to people at all hours of the day and night. 
K.  The architectural style and use of materials should be consistent throughout the entire mixed-use project. Differences in materials and/or architectural details should only occur on a structure where the intent is to differentiate between the residential scale and character of the structure and the nonresidential scale and character. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 75-220. - Determination of compliance. 
    The building official shall require that all building codes are complied with and shall not issue a building permit for development subject to this article, unless the CAB has certified compliance with this article.

Sec. 75-270. - Additional single-family residential development design standards (anti-monotony review). 
A.  Purpose and intent. In order to encourage an attractive and interesting streetscape, single-family detached residential developments shall employ fundamental design principles in order to provide differentiation among adjacent homes. Many elements make up the elevation of a home, including but not limited to architectural style, architectural accent elements, massing, setback, building elevation, color scheme, material and texture, landscape, and hardscape. Combining all or some of these elements in a variety of ways is necessary to provide the desired diversity in architectural style between single-family homes within close proximity. 
B.  Anti-monotony requirements. To ensure this diversity, all detached single-family residential development within a planned unit development or a platted residential subdivision with more than two (2) lots shall be designed and maintained in accordance with the following requirements: 
1.  The city commission appoints the planning and zoning director as the authority to review all applications for building permits that are subject to compliance with this section. The decision of the director shall be appealable to the city commission within ten (10) days of the date it is rendered. Appeals shall be in writing on a form provided by the planning and zoning director or his/her designee. 
2.  Each detached single-family home shall be built and maintained with substantially different primary paint color and elevation design, and preferably different roof tile design or color, from any other detached single-family home that is adjacent on the same side of the street (side-by-side), directly across the street, and diagonally across the street to either side of the house directly across the street. The director shall review all applications for building permit to assure compliance with these requirements. No building permit shall be issued for a single-family detached residence subject to this section without said approval. 
Editor's note- Prior to September 21, 2015, only paint color, roof design and color, or elevation had to be different, and homes located diagonally across the street. 
3.  The planning and zoning director shall establish appropriate application procedures to permit adequate review as required herein or appeals as provided for herein and shall establish a separate fee to assure that the city is reimbursed for the cost of the review. 
4.  Any person or entity selling dwelling units subject to these requirements may apply for an exemption from the procedures for monotony review as set forth in this section. In order to obtain such an exemption the applicant must be selling homes from models. In such case, the applicant must submit elevations of models, available paint colors, roof tile materials and color to the city manager or his/her designee. Along with this material, the applicant must submit a written methodology by which it proposes to ensure compliance with the anti-monotony provisions of this section. The city commission will then review the proposed methodology and elevations of all model homes to be used in the development and, if the city commission determines that said implementation procedures and models will satisfactorily insure compliance with the anti-monotony provisions of this section, the city commission shall then authorize the applicant to use models and those procedures in the sale of dwelling units within that particular subdivision. In such case, there will be no requirement for review as set forth in this section. The applicant shall be required to cooperate with the city manager or his/her designee to develop monitoring procedures so that the city may confirm that the procedure is properly implemented to insure compliance with the anti-monotony provisions of this section. Should the city manager or his/her designee determine that the procedure approved by the city commission is not being properly implemented so as to insure compliance with the anti-monotony provisions of this section then, in that event, he shall inform the city commission and then, after notice to the applicant and the opportunity to be heard, the city commission may revoke the exemption from the review procedures set forth in this section, and require said review for each dwelling unit. A finding of violation of the terms of any approved exemption shall cause the city to deny further building permits until the applicant remedies the violation.

In determining whether or not an application for a certificate of appropriateness should be granted, granted with conditions, or denied, the board shall consider the following criteria: 
1.  The extent to which the applicant's proposal is in conformance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings; 
2.  The extent that the applicant's proposal maintains the historic qualities of the historic landmark structure or the historic landmark site; and 
3.  Safety of the occupants. 
If the board approves the application, a certificate of appropriateness shall be issued. If the certificate of appropriateness is issued, the application shall be processed in the same manner as applications for building or demolition permits. There shall be a delay of ten (10) working days between the board granting of a certificate of appropriateness and the commencement of any work on the site in order to provide time for an appeal in accordance with this ordinance. If the board disapproves the application, a certificate of appropriateness shall not be issued. 
D.  Demolition of buildings on landmark inventory. 
1.  For any building that is approved to be demolished, before a demolition permit is issued there will be a delay of one hundred eighty (180) days to permit the notice action described in this subsection. 
2.  A notice shall be posted by the city on the premises of the building or structure proposed for demolition in a location clearly visible from the street. This notice must remain posted during the notification period and it shall be unlawful to remove same, other than by the city. In addition, the city shall publish a legal notice in a newspaper of general circulation, ten (10) days following the approval of the certificate of appropriateness authorizing demolition of the historically designated property. The purpose of this procedure is to further the purposes of this chapter by preserving significant buildings which are important to the education, culture, tradition, aesthetics and economic values of the city, and to afford the city, interested parties, historical societies or organizations the opportunity to acquire or to arrange for the preservation of such structures and sites. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 80-70. - Maintenance of designated properties. 
    Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the cleaning, ordinary repairs or maintenance of any exterior elements of any building or structure which does not involve a change of design, appearance or material, and which does not require a building permit, nor shall anything is this chapter be construed to prevent the addition, removal or alteration of landscaping, driveways, walkways, pools, fences or other site improvements, except: i) with regard to any designated historic landmark site; or ii) with regard to any designated historic structure when such site improvements are important in defining the overall historic character of the designated historic landmark structure. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 80-80. - Archaeologically significant resources. 
A.  Purpose and intent. A number of archaeologically significant areas have been identified within the city limits. These areas have not been mapped by the city, but have been generally known by city residents and located during field surveys by representatives of the Broward County Historical Commission, State of Florida Division of Historical Resources and other agencies. 
B.  Archaeological survey required. If archaeologically significant areas are present on a site, then the exact location and extent of the archaeologically significant site shall be surveyed by a professional archeologist and coordinated with the Broward County Historical Commission and State of Florida Division of Historical Resources. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 80-90. - Archaeologically significant resources. 
    In order to preserve these important historical resources, the criteria in this section shall apply to the development of parcels containing archaeologically significant areas: 
A.  In-situ or natural state preservation of a site is the preferred method of avoiding damage to an archeological resource. 
B.  Preserving the site is more important than preserving the artifacts alone because the relationship of the artifacts to each other in the site provides valuable information that can be lost when artifacts are removed. Further, preserving the site keeps it available for more sophisticated future research techniques. 
C.  When a residential parcel contains an archaeologically significant site, any development on that site shall be located and designed in such a way that preserves the archaeologically significant areas as common open space. 
D.  When a nonresidential parcel contains an archaeologically significant site, construction shall avoid damage to the site by planning construction to avoid the site. If development planning constraints preclude avoiding the site altogether, then easily removed facilities such as parking lots, tennis courts, or other similar nonpermanent construction may be allowed above the site provided there is "capping" or covering of the archeological site first with a layer of soil to protect the site. Capping may be used where: 
1.  The soils to be covered will not suffer serious compaction; 
2.  The covering materials are not chemically active; 
3.  The site is one in which the natural processes of deterioration have been slowed; and 
4.  The site has been recorded. 
E.  A buffer may be required between the development and the archeological site. The width of the buffer shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the professional archeologist after consultation with representatives of the State of Florida Division of Historical Resources. 
F.  The archeological site, if preserved in situ, shall be protected from construction activity by the use of barriers. 
G.  If deemed appropriate after consultation with representatives of the State of Florida Division of Historical Resources, the site may be mitigated through data recovery. 
H.  If, during the construction phase of a development, an archeological find is made on a parcel not previously identified as an archaeologically significant site, the developer shall cease work within twenty (20) feet in all directions of the find and within five (5) working days shall notify by writing the Department and Representatives of the State of Florida. The developer shall engage a professional archeologist to have an archeological and historical survey prepared. Within ten (10) working days, the archeologist shall determine, after consultation with the State of Florida Division of Historical Resources, whether or not the find is significant and, if so, the actual dimensions of the site. A significant archeological find is one which: 
1.  Is associated with an event or person of recognized significance in Florida or American history or recognized scientific importance in prehistory; 
2.  Can provide information which is both of demonstrable public interest and useful in addressing scientifically consequential and reasonable archeological research questions; 
3.  Has a special or particular quality such as oldest, best example, largest, or last surviving example of its kind; 
4.  Possesses substantial stratigraphic integrity; or 
5.  Involves important research questions that historical research has shown can be answered only with archeological methods. 
I.  If the find is not determined to be significant the developer may resume construction without amendment to the development plan. 
J.  If the find is determined to be significant, the developer shall have the option of revising the development plan so as to comply with this section or mitigating through data recovery. 
K.  If a determination is not made within the ten-working-day time period, then the find shall not be considered significant and the developer may resume construction without amendment to the development plan.

ARTICLE 85. - AFFORDABLE HOUSING SECTION 

Sec. 85-10. - Affordable housing incentive program. 
A.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to provide for and maintain a variety of housing opportunities for present and future residents of the City of Parkland. The provisions of this section shall supersede any conflicting provisions of this land development code. The section is intended to comply with F.S. ch. 163 generally and the Broward County Land Use Plan, Objective 1.07.00 and supporting policies and the City of Parkland Land Use Element. 
B.  Definitions. 
1.  Affordable housing means an owner-occupied or rental dwelling unit that has a mortgage or rental payment, including utilities, not exceeding thirty (30) percent of the gross income of households at or below one hundred twenty (120) percent of the area median income, as adjusted for family size. 
2.  Workforce housing means an owner-occupied or rental dwelling unit that has a mortgage or rental payment, including utilities, not exceeding twenty (20) percent of the annual gross income of households at or below one hundred forty (140) percent of the area median income, as adjusted for family size.

These incentives are listed below, along with the percentage of the units in the entire development which must meet the standards of affordable housing as defined in this land development code. This section of the code shall supersede when in conflict with other articles and sections of the land development code. 
1.  Permit and review fee refunds. All developments committing to fifteen (15) percent affordable housing units shall be eligible for refund of fifty (50) percent of all land development review and building permit fees. Refunding of permit and review shall be funded from a special line item in the budget for said matters or if no special line item exists, from the general fund. Developments will be eligible to request a refund of permit and review fees only for the units designated as affordable, contingent upon the availability of funds. This does not include impact fees, and park and multipurpose trail dedication requirements. Applicants seeking fee refunds shall submit an application on forms provided by the city. 
2.  Affordability agreement. The recipient of any affordable housing incentive shall enter into a deed restriction affordability agreement with the county.

Developments located within any residential or commercial zoning district or future land use category with a density of six (6) units per acre or greater, and with a minimum fifteen (15) percent of units designated as affordable housing, are eligible to apply for a fifteen (15) percent density bonus consistent with the criteria in Broward County Land Use Plan, provided the city has available reserve or flexibility units under the rules and regulations set forth in the Broward County Land Use Plan. To the extent permitted by the Broward County Land Use Plan, an application for a density bonus shall not require a land use plan amendment or rezoning and shall be submitted and evaluated as part of a site plan or plat application. In evaluating the density bonus request, the city shall consider the density and intensity of surrounding land uses and compatibility with neighboring uses in determining the maximum density to allow. A density bonus may be less than the highest density bonus amount permitted. Density bonuses may be considered only within the development site creating the bonus units. 
b.  In addition to the criteria set forth the application of the density bonus shall require consideration of the necessary infrastructure to support the increase in density. 
c.  Density bonus agreement. Any developer obtaining a density bonus shall enter into a land use and deed restriction agreement with the city.

An application for a density bonus, that does not otherwise require a rezoning or amendment to the comprehensive plan by the Broward County Land Use Plan shall be submitted and evaluated in the same manner as a site plan. In evaluating the density bonus request, the city shall consider the density and intensity of surrounding land uses and compatibility with neighboring uses in determining the maximum density to allow. A density bonus may be less than the highest density bonus amount permitted. Density bonuses may be considered only within the development site creating the bonus units. 
2.  Permit and review fee refunds. All developments with workforce housing units shall be eligible for refunds of fifty (50) percent of all development review and building permit fees paid. This does not include impact fees, connection fees or similar fees. The refund shall be paid from a special line item in the budget established for said purposes or if no such fund is established, from the general fund. 
3.  Workforce housing agreement. The recipient of any workforce housing incentive shall enter into deed restriction agreement with the city. The agreement shall provide the number and designation level of workforce units, and period of time as workforce housing, and any other requirements in order to receive housing trust fund monies or units consistent with the written policies and procedures established by the city commission. 
E.  Modification of development standards for affordable and workforce housing. 
1.  Incentives. The following requirements or standards may be reduced by up to fifteen (15) percent for developments committing to a minimum of fifteen (15) percent affordable or workforce housing, provided they do not have negative impacts to the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City of Parkland as determined in the sole discretion of the city commission. These include:

2.  If the application is made in conjunction with development plans submitted for approval, the application will be considered as part of the site plan and no permit shall be issued without site plan approval. 
E.  Issuance. 
1.  Removal. No permit shall be issued for tree removal unless one (1) of the following conditions exists: 
a.  The tree as described above is located in a buildable area, street right-of-way, canal right-of-way, or utility easement where a structure or improvement is to be placed and it unreasonably restricts the use of the property. For the purpose of this subsection, buildable area shall be deemed to include areas necessary for the construction of a pool, accompanying deck, or a patio, but shall not be deemed to include areas necessary for the construction of tennis or other game courts. If certain trees outside the above areas must be removed to allow the operation of equipment, the site plan shall include the exact operation area needed. 
b.  The tree is diseased, injured, in danger of falling too close to existing or proposed structures, interferes with utility service, creates unsafe vision clearance or conflicts with other ordinances or regulations. 
c.  The tree unreasonably restricts bona fide agricultural use of the property. To qualify under this section, the owner must submit to the city a survey showing all trees as described above to be removed, including their exact location, common and botanical names, and caliper size. Should the owner or any future owner of the property wish to develop the property for some use other than agriculture, a quantity of trees will have to be planted on the site which will equal the cumulative caliper dimension of those desirable trees removed. The planting shall be in addition to the required landscaping as outlined in division 15 of this article. If the required trees do not fit on the approved site, an equal caliper shall be planted on city property at the discretion of city staff or an equivalent value per caliper inch be deposited into the City Tree Trust Fund. 
2.  Relocation or replacement. 
a.  As a condition to granting a permit, the city may permit the applicant to relocate or replace a tree being removed at the applicant's expense in lieu of payment of tree removal fee, either within the project site, or in the event that replacement of the tree within the site is not practical, with the concurrence of the city, on public or private land owned by the permit applicant within the city, retaining for future use or donating to any citizen or group of citizens, for any purpose deemed in the public interest by the city commission. A replacement tree shall be a type of species having shade potential and other positive values, at least equal to that of the tree being removed, and shall be a minimum of twelve (12) feet in height when planted. The planted tree shall not be of the nuisance types as defined elsewhere herein. Trees must be relocated or replaced as specified by this section within thirty (30) days of the granting of a tree removal permit; provided, however, if the trees are to be removed to facilitate construction or development activities, said relocation or replacement must be completed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy on the construction, development site or phase of development, as applicable. The trees to be relocated or replaced must be maintained in a healthy growing condition and guaranteed for a period of at least one (1) year. 
b.  For tree replacement requirements of one (1) to five (5) trees, a minimum of thirty (30) percent native species shall be utilized as a replacement tree. For six (6) to ten (10) replacement trees required, a minimum of thirty (30) percent native species shall be utilized. For eleven (11) to twenty (20) replacement trees required, a minimum of thirty (30) percent native species shall be utilized. For twenty-one (21) to fifty (50) replacement trees required, a minimum of thirty (30) percent native species shall be utilized. For fifty-one (51) or more replacement trees required, a minimum of thirty (30) percent native species shall be utilized. 
3.  Maintenance/monitoring requirements for replaced trees. Any owner upon whose property the tree replacement activity occurs shall: 
a.  Maintain the health of a replacement tree for a period of one (1) year from the date of planting. 
b.  Replace within sixty (60) days any replaced tree that dies or is determined to be effectively destroyed within one (1) year of being planted, as determined by the city. The one-year maintenance period shall begin anew whenever a tree is replaced. 
4.  Tree replacement for specimen trees. 
a.  A specimen tree approved for removal as provided herein shall be replaced with a quantity of trees to be planted on site equal to the cumulative caliper dimension to the specimen tree removed. Replacement trees will be a minimum of twelve (12) feet in height at time of planting. 
b.  In the event the replacement of a specimen tree within the site is not practical, a tree appraisal will be performed by the city landscape architect or the ISA Certified Arborist to determine the dollar value of the specimen tree approved for removal. This appraisal shall be pursuant to the "Guide for Plant Appraisal, 9th Edition," as amended, by the council of tree and landscape appraisers. The number of replacement trees will be calculated to equal the appraised value of the specimen tree removed. This calculation shall include the purchase price of the replacement tree, plus installation costs. The applicant will be required to compensate the number of replacement trees indicated for the removal of the specimen trees. 
F.  Tree bank. Where a tree is to be removed and will not be relocated or replaced by the permit applicant under the provisions of this chapter, the city shall have the option to relocate the tree at the owner's expense to city-owned property for planting, either for permanent utilization at the new location, or for future use at other city property in lieu of charging a tree removal fee. In these instances said relocation shall be accomplished within a reasonable period of time and in such a manner so as not to unreasonably delay any construction or development within said property. 
1.  Tree mitigation. 
a.  Designated for conservation. Trees designated for conservation are those trees which have been determined by the city as shown on an approved tree removal/relocation permit or areas within the city which have been determined by Broward County or the City of Parkland as subject to conservation and as stated specifically within the tree removal/relocation permit. 
b.  Tree replacement. The replacement of a removed or damaged tree to compensate for that tree's removal or its damage shall be a tree-for-tree replacement meeting minimum standards as set forth in [this] article 95 of this chapter. The minimums established in [this] article 95 of this chapter for tree planting may not count toward the tree replacement amount established in this section. The replacement species shall be native or trees of similar species to those removed as approved by the city landscape architect. 
c.  Tree-for-tree replacement. The replacement of a removed tree shall be a tree with a minimum of two (2) inches in cumulative trunk diameter at breast height. Where acts of God or other extraordinary circumstances, as identified by the City of Parkland City Commission, Broward County or the State of Florida, create conditions which make this section unduly burdensome will be exempt. The quantity of tree-for-tree replacements (not requiring replacement prior to a certificate of occupancy) must be replaced within the following timeframes: 
Number of Required 
Replacement Trees Minimum 
Replacement 
Timeframe 1-5 30 days 6-15 60 days 16-20 90 days 21+ 120 days  
d.  Optional cash payment. An optional cash payment equal to the fair market value of the required replacement trees paid by the applicant after recommendation from the city of engineering department that replacement of trees on site pursuant to this subsection is not feasible. 
G.  Tree credit. Credit shall be given for the off-site planting of trees meeting the definition of equivalent tree replacement required by this section in accordance with the following terms and conditions: 
1.  A tree planting credit agreement must be executed by the person requesting such credit on a form approved by the city attorney specifying the numbers and location of such trees for which credit is sought. 
2.  This agreement will specify who may utilize the credit and for which properties. The City of Parkland Engineering Department is responsible for issuing tree removal/relocation permits shall maintain the records of how much credit is currently available on the tree planting credit agreement. This record shall include the name of the individual authorized to use such credit, the location where the credit is used, the amount of credit used, and the resulting balance of credit available. 
H.  Bond for tree relocation, replacement. A bond shall be held by the city for one (1) year to insure tree replacement in the event that tree relocation results in the death of any tree subject to a tree removal/relocation permit or for any tree damaged or destroyed in any pre-development or development activities such as surveying. Such bond amount shall be assessed at the fair market value of the required replacement trees or for tree replacement which cannot be effected prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the underlying project. If the developer/builder desires, it may employ a landscape architect to supply revised bonding amounts for city review and engineering department approval if the landscape architect determines that the trees or palms subject to relocation are unlikely to die as a result of the pre-construction or construction activities. Tree bond amounts of under one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) are to be guaranteed through a letter of guarantee rather than through a posting of a cash bond. 
1.  Tree trust fund or tree bank. 
a.  Establishment. A tree trust fund (hereinafter referred to as the Parkland Tree Preservation Account or the "trust") is hereby established as a depository for tree removal fees and penalty monies. Such monies shall be placed in an interest bearing account solely for the purpose of funding tree mitigation projects on public property within the city. 
b.  Term of existence. The trust shall be self-perpetuating from year to year unless specifically terminated by the city commission. 
c.  Trust assets. All monies received pursuant to the provisions of this section from public or private concerns shall be placed in trust to insure the use and benefit of the city and its successors and assigns in interest. 
2.  Trust administration. Monies obtained pursuant to this shall be credited to the trust by the city finance department. 
3.  Disbursal of assets. 
a.  Expenditures of over twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) shall require approval of the city commission. 
b.  Trust funds shall be used for tree mitigation projects and to obtain trees, landscaping, sprinkler systems and any other items or materials necessary and proper for the preservation, maintenance, relocation or restoration of tree ecosystems, on any public land in the city. With city commission approval, these monies may also be utilized to engage support elements, such as landscape architects and additional personnel if deemed necessary in the opinion of the city manager. These monies may also be used to cover the expense of relocation of trees in the city. 
4.  Appeal. Should any person decide to appeal any staff decision made based on this section can be done so to the planning and zoning advisory board sitting as the Parkland Tree Board. 
I.  Tree protection. 
1.  During the land clearing and construction stage of development, the developer shall clearly mark all trees to be maintained and shall erect and maintain protective barriers as described in the "Tree Protection Manual for Builders and Developers," by the Florida Department of Agricultural and Consumer Services, to the "drip line" (wherever practical as determined by the city landscape architect) around such trees or group of trees. 
2.  General requirements include:

DIVISION 15. - LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL NEW AND EXISTING RESIDENTIAL AND NON-RESIDENTIAL USES 

Sec. 95-1505. - Parklike setting. 
A.  Parklike setting characteristics. All applications for site plan approval or building permit shall be reviewed and evaluated to conform to the requirements of a "parklike setting," defined as follows: 
1.  The landscaping and natural areas of the parcel are the major visual element of the overall design as viewed from the exterior of the parcel. This aspect of the parklike setting requirement shall be the major visual element of the site plan review and it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to submit a landscaping plan which is fully integrated so as to create this effect. 
2.  The elements of the vegetation, landscaping, water and natural environment are the major visual element of the parcel of land when viewed together with other design aspects. 
3.  The spatial scale and character of the landscape design shall be visually consistent and proportionate to the intensity and character of adjacent development. Natural vegetative buffers shall project the parklike look to adjacent development. 
4.  Special design emphasis shall be placed on the landscape enhancement of ingress and egress points and screening of parking areas from public view. 
5.  Entrances to residential subdivisions and nonresidential developments (e.g., commercial projects) shall be landscaped such that vegetation (e.g., trees and shrubs) is the predominant feature as opposed to any proposed hardscape elements (e.g., walls, fountains, and signs). The appearance of any proposed hardscape elements shall be softened by the planting of vegetation of appropriate scale and mass in front of, behind, and around such elements. 
B.  Performance standard. The parklike setting requirement is a mandatory performance standard that all properties must satisfy. This performance standard takes precedence over the minimum quantitative standards of this division. To implement these parklike setting requirements, the applicant shall meet or exceed all landscaping requirements specified herein. An applicant who has satisfied the minimum standards for quantities and dimensions set forth herein shall be in compliance with this division only if a parklike setting has been achieved, as determined by the city. Accordingly, the city may require additional landscaping in order to ensure creation of a parklike setting as set forth above if the standards contained below do not adequately achieve that effect for the particular application. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 95-1510. - General requirements. 
A.  Lawns. On all developed lots, lawns or other landscape material shall be placed on all areas not covered by main and accessory structures, pavement, and nursery growing areas, horse arenas, and water bodies. Active pastures must be covered by eighty (80) percent natural green vegetation, natural grassy plants or the entire pasture must be screened from view. Hedges, when required, shall be a minimum of twenty-four (24) inches at planting or prior to certificate of occupancy or a bond will be required in the amount of the installed shrub materials. Hedges shall be maintained at a height of between four (4) and five (5) feet. Lawns shall extend to any abutting street pavement edge and to the mean waterline of any abutting canal, lake or waterway (not to exceed thirty (30) feet from said waterline to property line). Landscape material shall be used and installed in such a manner as to allow reasonable maintenance. Where existing bank slopes are steeper than four (4) to one (1), they shall be cut back at the time of construction to result in a slope of four (4) to one (1) or less. No bank slope shall be changed without approval of the city engineer and the appropriate governmental agency responsible for water management. 
B.  Sight distance at intersections. On all lots, sight distance at intersections must be maintained in conformance with the Florida Department of Transportation, Roadway Design Criteria, as amended from time to time.

3 Includes commercial recreation use. 
B.  Buffer landscape and hardscape. 
1.  The buffers shall contain three (3) layers of plantings, walls or mounding at three (3) levels to assure opacity. For each buffer of thirty (30) feet wide or less, each one hundred (100) linear feet of landscaped buffer area, shall provide a minimum of four (4) staggered trees, each a minimum of fourteen (14) feet in height with a minimum of six-foot spread, and six (6) staggered understory trees, each a minimum of six (6) feet in height with a minimum of four-foot spread, (all heights measured at planting) shall be installed or preserved. In addition, a minimum of one hundred (100) shrubs and bushes and fifty (50) groundcover plants or equivalent plant material shall be installed for each one hundred (100) linear feet of landscape buffer area. 
2.  Each additional ten (10) feet of buffer width or portion thereof, beyond thirty (30) feet shall contain an additional two (2) staggered trees, three (3) understory trees, fifty (50) shrubs and twenty-five (25) groundcover. The trees and understory size minimums will be the same as the in the preceding sentence. Palm species can also be used to create a parklike setting and substituted for the trees per section 95-1545, installation, maintenance and materials, subsection C.3.e. The plant material shall be placed in such a manner to support a parklike setting. In addition, the landscaping plan shall incorporate a combination of at least two (2) of the following: Mounding, fencing, walls, or supplemental planting, to further promote a parklike setting and to create a visual buffering level between the higher tree canopy and ground cover/shrubs. Screening of parking areas or internal roadways shall be accomplished by a combination of plant materials, opaque fencing, opaque walls, (natural materials wherever possible) mounding, or other landscape materials, installed at a total minimum height of sixty (60) inches above the average grade of the vehicular use area, with at least three (3) feet of flat surface. All requirements are minimums and the city may require additional landscaping in order to create a parklike setting and opaque screening of parking lots and vehicular use areas. Vegetation shall not be planted in straight lines, but designed to create visual interest and depth and to maximize the screening effect for neighboring properties. Additional trees shall be required in locations appropriate to shield adjacent residential areas from lighting fixtures. 
3.  The required buffer for a nonresidential and nonagricultural development or use adjacent to a residential district or use shall include a continuous, unpierced masonry wall of at least six (6) feet in height, finished on both sides with two (2) coats in cement stucco, painted to match buildings.

Palms that have a minimum of five (5) feet of clear trunk or a caliper dimension of six (6) inches at a point at least eighteen (18) inches above the root ball and achieve a twelve-foot crown spread singularly, or when grouped in threes, may be counted one (1) for one (1) as trees complying with the provisions of this chapter. If palms are so used, they shall make up no more than twenty-five (25) percent of the total required trees, unless noted otherwise. 
f.  Shrubs shall have a minimum height of eighteen (18) inches with a spread of eighteen (18) inches, when measured immediately after planting. 
g.  Hedges, where required, shall be planted at twenty-four (24) inches on center and maintained so as to form a visual screen. Shrubs used as hedges shall be Florida Department of Agriculture Grade No. 1 or better, with a minimum height of twenty-four (24) inches and a minimum spread of eighteen (18) inches when measured immediately after planting. Where larger material is used, spacing may be increased and planted so as to provide a continuous barrier, but not so close as to be detrimental to the plant material. 
4.  Grass areas shall be planted with an approved species that is certified disease and insect free for South Florida. Lawn areas shall be sodded; however, lawns may be seeded or sprigged with approval of the city landscape architect. Sod provided must be viable, reasonable free of weeds, and capable of growth and development. In general, sod strips shall be aligned with tightly fitted staggered joints and no overlap of butts or sides. Subgrade of lawn area after finished grading shall be reasonably free of all stones, sticks, roots and other matter prior to the placement of sod. New lawns shall be watered immediately after planting and shall be maintained in a living condition. 
5.  Ground covers and mulch used in lieu of grass, in whole or in part, in natural areas shall be planted or laid in such a manner as to present a finished appearance and complete coverage. Except in agricultural and estate districts, and parks, ground covers in lieu of grass areas are subject to the approval of the city landscape architect pursuant to section 95-1575, variances.

Sec. 95-1555. - Removal of existing plant material. 
A.  In instances where healthy plant material exists on a site, and is to be retained, the city landscape architect may adjust the application of the minimum requirements to allow a maximum of fifty (50) percent credit for a consideration of such plant material, if such an adjustment is in keeping with and will preserve the intent of this division. In such cases, a survey as provided in section 95-1010, general requirements - tree removal and tree preservation, subsection C., shall be provided to the building department specifying the species, approximate height and caliper dimension, as well as the location and condition of any plant material used as a basis for requesting this adjustment. Any adjustment shall be based on unique circumstances applicable to the lot in question with the object of such adjustment being to preserve existing vegetation or to maintain a tree canopy. 
B.  No existing desirable or protected plant material shall be destroyed or removed, without tree removal and land permits as described elsewhere in this chapter, unless such plant material creates an immediate danger to the public safety through disease, damage or the like. This section shall not apply to exotic species such as Brazilian pepper or Melaleuca. 
C.  Any vegetation that encroaches onto or destroys public property, or without permission private property, or limits visibility through the public right-of-way shall be removed from the property at the landowner's expense. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015)

B.  Requirements for permit. No permit shall be granted unless the applicant provides a plan, signed and sealed by a registered landscape architect, which plan provides for additional landscaping which will assure that there shall be no decrease in the opacity of the landscaping on the buffer and that the opacity provided for in the landscaping plan shall be comparable to that existing on the buffer at the time the permit is sought. The city commission must approve any such plan prior to issuance of the permit. 
C.  Fee. The city commission does hereby impose a fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). 
D.  Violation. Any violation of this section shall be punishable by a fine of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00). A violation of this section shall be considered to be the removal or excessive trimming of the landscaping referred to herein within the buffer, as well as each day thereafter that the buffer continues to exist with the removed or excessively trimmed or hat-racked landscaping, as prohibited in this section so that the fine shall be five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 95-1565. - Plan approval. 
A.  Plan required. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, a landscape plan prepared by a landscape architect, registered in the State of Florida, shall be submitted to and approved by the city landscape architect, or agents thereof, subject to the review and approval of such other agencies as may be deemed advisable. 
B.  Scale, contents. The landscape plan shall be drawn to a one (1) inch equals twenty (20) feet scale minimum, or as required by the city, to clearly show the design intent, including dimensions, areas and distances, and clearly delineate the existing and proposed parking spaces or other vehicular use areas, access aisles, driveways, sight visibility triangles (using grayscale), utility and drainage easements, coverage of required irrigation systems, water outlet locations and the location and size of buildings. On projects of more than five (5) acres in size, the applicant may request verbal approval from the city landscape architect that plans be drawn at a smaller scale. 
C.  Tabulations. The plan shall also designate on the plan and in tabular form, the quantity by name, size and location, of the plant material to be installed, or if existing, to be used in accordance with the requirements hereof. No permit shall be issued for such building unless such landscape plan complies with the provisions herein. The landscape plan shall be legible and drawn to a suitable scale to show required information and shall include tabular data regarding the number of required and provided trees, shrubs and groundcovers. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 95-1570. - Nonconforming sites. 
    No existing properties shall be permitted to increase the degree of nonconformity as it pertains to this chapter. Wherever developments have required landscaped areas, said areas are to conform to this chapter. 
A.  Existing development shall have one (1) year from the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived to conform as required above. 
B.  This section does not require removal of healthy plant material.

(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 95-1575. - Variances. 
A.  Intent. The city recognizes that there may be situations where flexibility in species specification, quantity or design may be considered desirable by the city in order to provide a "park-like setting," particularly in cases where special circumstances or natural features make literal application of this division a hardship, and an alternate landscape plan may be a reasonable alternative. 
B.  Scope of relief. The city commission, may approve or, approve with conditions, a variance from the species, height, spread, or quantity, design or location of landscape material (including street trees or lawn area) required by this chapter based upon the circumstances described in subsection A., and a showing by the applicant that the alternate proposal which varies from minimum requirements of this division meets or exceeds the requirement of a "park-like setting," as defined in this chapter. 
C.  Process. The applicant shall follow the variance procedures set forth in article 55, division 5, variances, except as provided in this section. The application shall be reviewed by the planning and zoning board, sitting as the Parkland Tree Board, which shall make a recommendation to the city commission. 
D.  Criteria. The criteria listed below shall replace the criteria of section 55-530, variance standards, guidelines and review criteria: 
1.  There are special and unique conditions which create an undue hardship, which conditions do not apply generally to other types of trees or other properties; 
2.  Any alleged hardship is not self-created; 
3.  The variance sought is the minimum required to alleviate the hardship; 
4.  The granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the general intent and purposes of this division, and specifically section 95-1505, parklike setting. 
5.  The variance sought shall be compatible with the natural landscaping existing within the surrounding area. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 95-1580. - Penalty. 
    Any person who shall violate any provisions of this article or fail to comply therewith or with any other requirements hereof shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), and each day said violation shall exist or be permitted to exist shall constitute a separate offense. Further, with respect to trees, each incident involving each tree shall be considered a separate violation of this article punishable by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00). 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 95-1585. - Parkland tree board. 
A.  The planning and zoning board of the city shall enforce the terms of this section and sit as the Parkland tree board. 
B.  The Parkland tree board shall have as its duties and responsibilities to study, investigate, council and develop as well as promote the care, preservation, pruning, planting, replanting, removal or disposition of trees and shrubs in parks, recreation, and open space as well as along streets and thoroughfares and in other public areas. The board, when requested by the city commission, shall consider, make finding, report and recommend upon any special matter of question being within the scope of its jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 95-1590. - Arbor streets. 
A.  Designation criteria. An arbor street shall be a street designated by the city commission, as set forth herein, based upon the existence of extensive vegetation bordering the street. For designation as an arbor street, the vegetation must be dense in character, contain vegetation or trees in excess of fifteen (15) feet in height for substantial lengths of the road, and creates a rural feel for significant lengths of the road. The city does hereby find that Holmberg Road is an arbor street for its entire length within the city. Other streets may be designated as arbor streets by resolution of the city commission, provided the city makes a specific finding that the requirements set forth above have been met. 
B.  Effect. Where a street has been designated as an arbor street, no vegetation of any type whatsoever shall be removed from the right-of-way for the arbor street without the specific permission of the city. 
C.  Permit procedure for removing landscape material. Said permission must be granted by the city commission after review by the planning and zoning board. All applications shall first be reviewed by the city landscape architect, who shall make a recommendation with regard to the application. The city shall process any completed application within ninety (90) days of submittal. This provision may be waived by the city manager in cases deemed to be a public emergency. No removal shall be permitted, notwithstanding the fact that there exists in the area an exotic species which would normally be unregulated if the removal of that species or, any other species, would cause the character of the vegetation along the arbor street to be materially changed. The standard for granting permission for a private party to remove vegetation outside of the right-of-way shall be whether the removal of the vegetation shall cause these to be a material diminution in the amount, size, density or quality of this vegetation bordering the road and whether there are commitments to replace the vegetation which maintains the rural and vegetated feel of the road. Replacement buffer shall be installed in no more than ninety (90) days from removal and achieve opaqueness in no more than one (1) year from date of installation. 
D.  Trimming restrictions. Unless approved by the city landscape architect in writing, no trimming of vegetation on the right-of-way of an arbor street or within fifteen (15) feet of an arbor street or any undertaking which has the effect of threatening the health of the vegetation on the arbor street or in the case of trees in excess of fifteen (15) feet of height reduces the height of said tree by more than ten (10) percent or, in the opinion of the city landscape architect, is not necessary for the health of the tree. In the case of shrubbery, no trimming of shrubbery in excess of six (6) feet in height may be undertaken which reduces the height of said shrubbery by more than one (1) foot or, in the opinion of the city landscape architect, endangers the health of the shrubbery. The city landscape architect shall provide application forms for obtaining permission to undertake the trimming herein prescribed. The standard for granting permission for a private party to trim vegetation outside of the right-of-way shall be whether the removal of the vegetation shall cause these to be a material diminution in the amount, size, density or quality of vegetation bordering the road, whether there are commitments to replace the vegetation with vegetation which maintains the rural and vegetated feel of the road. 
E.  Violations. Any violation of this article shall be punishable by a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or sixty (60) days in prison. Where a violation occurs, each day that the violation continues to exist without immediate remedial action aimed at prompt restoration of the previous condition, shall be considered a separate violation of this article, punishable by a five hundred dollar ($500.00) fine. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 95-1595. - Temporary relief from landscape standards. 
A.  Scope of relief. The time for installation of landscaping required by this article may be temporarily extended, in individual cases, by the planning and zoning director in accordance with this section. Where acts of God or other extraordinary circumstances, as identified by the City of Parkland City Commission, Broward County or the State of Florida, create conditions which make their immediate application unduly burdensome, the temporary relief from landscape requirements, as approved by the landscape plan, shall be for a limited period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days from the date of agreement issuance. 
B.  Application for relief. An application of temporary relief from landscape standards shall be submitted prior to the final landscape inspection request, accompanied by a landscape plan, identifying the plantings that have been postponed, the proposed planting schedule and the costs of the suspended planting. Planting cost estimates may be independently verified by the City of Parkland Planning Department at the applicant's expense. The hourly landscape plan review fee will be applied for all review and cost estimate verification. 
C.  Surety. Pending the review of the application of temporary relief from landscape standards, the property owner shall enter into an agreement, as approved by the city attorney, with the City of Parkland to allow issuance of the permit, certificate of occupancy or certificate of completion, only if the property owner provides adequate guarantee or surety that the terms of this section are met. The guarantee shall consist of a performance bond or other surety acceptable to the city attorney in an amount equal to one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the direct costs of materials, labor and any other costs, as determined by the city landscape architect, for completing the installation of the required landscaping. Performance bonds or other guarantees required pursuant to this section shall name the City of Parkland as a beneficiary and specify the time frame for the completion of the landscape installation. If the owner defaults under the agreement, the city may access the bond and hold the proceeds for the purposes of doing the work where access to the property will be required, or as a penalty at the city's sole discretion. Additionally, the fact that the city accepts the bond and keeps the funds as a penalty shall not relieve the owner from the obligation to comply with the landscape requirements, and the city may prosecute the owner for failure to comply with those requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
ARTICLE 100. - SIGNAGE 
DIVISION 5. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 100-510. - Scope, purpose, and intent. 
A.  Scope. 
1.  The provisions of this article shall govern the number, size, location, and character of all signs which may be permitted either as a main or accessory use under the terms of this article. No signs shall be permitted on a plot or parcel either as a main or accessory use except in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
2.  This article does not regulate government signs on government property, including, but not limited to, city signs on property owned by the city, the county or the State of Florida, and traffic control devices. 
3.  In the event of any conflict between this article and any declaration of covenants, bylaws, or other restrictions applying to any property within the city, the language affording the more restrictive interpretation shall apply. 
4.  The city specifically finds that these sign regulations are narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling and substantial governmental interests of traffic safety and aesthetics, and that there is no other way for the city to further these interests. 
B.  Purpose. 
1.  Florida Constitution. Article II, Section 7 of the Florida Constitution provides that "[i]t shall be the policy of the state to conserve and protect its natural resources and scenic beauty..." A beautiful environment preserves and enhances the desirability of the city as a place to live and to do business. Implementing the Florida Constitution is a compelling governmental interest. 
2.  Florida Statutes. Florida law require cities to adopt comprehensive plans and implement them through land development regulations (also known as zoning regulations) and approval of development orders that are consistent with the comprehensive plan. See F.S. ch. 163, pt. II. Florida law specifically requires that the city adopt sign regulations. See F.S. 163.3202(2)(f). Complying with state law is a compelling governmental interest. 
3.  City comprehensive plan. The city's comprehensive plan has numerous provisions that require the city to ensure the aesthetic character of the city and to ensure traffic safety on roads within the city through the regulation of signs, as set forth in detail below. Implementing the city comprehensive plan is a compelling governmental interest. 
a.  City comprehensive plan elements. The existing land use conditions in the city are described in the city's comprehensive plan as follows: "Parkland is largely residential in nature with some commercial development along SR 7/US 441 and near the old City Hall site (located on Parkside Drive). The City is characterized by its semirural, upscale single family neighborhoods and comparatively high average income and home values." According to the transportation element, "Growth and Development Activity," the city "is an upscale residential community with small scale commercial villages located in the northwest corner of Broward County. The City is made up of approximately 11.14 square miles, which is primarily residential with a few small areas of institutional, commercial and agricultural land uses scattered throughout... Due to the semi-isolated location of the City in proximity to the surrounding roadway network, through traffic has been and will continue to be discouraged while the mobility of City residents is promoted." The city also provides for the non-vehicular transportation needs of its residents and visitors, as described in "existing pedestrian, bicycle and horse facilities," "Schools, libraries, parks, shopping places, employment centers, and bus stops often generate pedestrian and bicyclist traffic. To maintain the mobility of a multimodal transportation system, it is important that the City of Parkland have a well-connected system for pedestrians, bicycles and horses, along with the existing roadway system. The City of Parkland is working to develop and maintain a thorough network of multi-use trails that serve pedestrians, bicyclists and horses. The multi-use trails are essentially six-foot wide, paved, meandering trails, which are set back a substantial distance from vehicular roadways. The city plans to expand and maintain the multi-use trail system throughout the city. The existing multi-use trail system is shown on Map 3-8." 
b.  City comprehensive plan goals, objectives and policies. Several goals, objectives and policies of the city's comprehensive plan require the city to maintain its scenic beauty and traffic safety through its land development regulations and actions: 
GOAL I. Growth And Development In Parkland Should Be Planned To Achieve A Quality Community Which Is Sensitive To The Uniqueness Of The City's Environment, Continues The City's Semi-Rural Character, And Yet Provides For The Full Needs Of Its Residents. 
Objective 1.1: Future growth and development will be managed through the implementation and enforcement of land development regulations in accordance with Chapter 163 F.S. Annually, review development permits to determine if those permits and their effects on the City's infrastructure are consistent with policies 1.1.1 through 1.1.3. 
Policy 1.1.1: Land development regulations will, at a minimum: ... 
f)  Regulate signage; ... 
Policy 1.1.4: The City shall ensure that all new development is compatible with the character of the City and with adjacent zoning, development and uses, and issue no development orders or permits deemed to be incompatible with the character of the City and with adjacent zoning, development and uses. 
Policy 1.1.5: The City shall establish a policy framework/foundation upon which land development regulations addressing signage may be based by December 2008. 
Objective 1.3: The City will ensure that land uses found to be inconsistent with the Community's character will not be permitted. Annually, review development within the City to determine any uses or development inconsistent with the community's character. 
Policy 1.3.3: Commercial development should emphasize planning of the total site as a whole in a cohesive form and linear or strip commercial sites will not be allowed. All commercial development shall be consistent with the architectural standards adopted by the City and shall be designed so as to be compatible with neighboring uses, developments, land uses and zoning. 
Policy 1.3.10: Preserve the character of existing residential neighborhoods: the BBB Ranches, Pine Tree Estates, Cypress Head, Country's Point, Riverside Acres and Cypress Trails, and all new developments. 
Policy 1.3.14: The City's Land Development Codes and Regulations shall protect existing and planned residential areas including single family neighborhoods, from disruptive land uses and nuisances. 
Policy 1.7.4: The City shall review for and require development which will maintain and facilitate a park like setting when appropriately designating land use categories or reviewing for land development permits. 
Policy 1.7.5: The City shall implement Land Development Regulations which require all non-single family residential development and all non-residential developments to be designed in a park-like setting. 
Policy 2.3.5: Principles and criteria for guiding the location of special residential housing shall include compatibility of housing with surrounding residential or non-residential uses, proper access to the site to ensure the adequacy of existing or proposed road systems, aesthetic controls of both signage and architecture to alleviate negative inconsistency impacts upon adjacent areas, security concerns of the proposed facilities, proper buffering through site plan review based on the traffic intensity of the activities at the facility, and proximity guidelines to ensure adequate distances between facilities. 
GOAL 3: A Safe, Convenient And Efficient Motorized And Non-Motorized Transportation System Shall Be Available For All Residents And Visitors To The City, Which Minimizes Through Traffic Within The City And Does Not Negatively Impact Residential Development. 
Objective 3.1: The City's transportation system will emphasize safety, efficiency and aesthetics and protection of residential areas. 
Policy 3.1.4: The City shall adopt and enforce criteria for landscaping and signs along roadways. All roadways adjacent to residential development shall be heavily buffered. 
Objective 3.5: The City will utilize all possible methods to discourage and prevent external traffic flow through the City, through Holmberg Road, or Riverside Drive. Holmberg Road shall remain a local two lane road whose primary aim will be to serve the residents of the City. All attempts to widen Holmberg Road shall be discouraged and resisted. Vehicular use of Riverside Drive shall terminate at Holmberg Road and Riverside Drive shall remain a four lane road. All attempts to widen or extend Riverside Drive as a vehicular thoroughfare north of Holmberg Road shall be discouraged and resisted. Consider right-of-way north of Holmberg Road in the former Riverside Drive extension for use as non-vehicular recreational thoroughfare. Annually, review the transportation system to determine if any actions have been approved which promote through traffic within the City. 
Policy 8.1.26: To enhance its rural image and flavor, the City shall consider the adoption and implementation of a uniform signage plan for all City parks, recreation facilities, and multipurpose trails. 
4.  Caselaw. In accordance with the U.S. Supreme Court's cases on sign regulation, the regulations in this article are not intended to regulate or censor speech based on its content or viewpoint, but rather to regulate the secondary effects of speech that may adversely affect the City's substantial and compelling governmental interests in preserving scenic beauty and community aesthetics, and in vehicular and pedestrian safety in conformance with the First Amendment. These cases and their holdings include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Reed v. Town of Gilbert, ___U.S.___, 135 S. Ct. 2218, 192 L. Ed. 2d 236 (2015) on the topic on noncommercial temporary signs; 
b.  Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981) on the topic of commercial signs and off-premise signs; 
c.  City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43 (1994) on the topic of political protest signs in residential areas; 
d.  Linmark Assocs., Inc. v. Township of Willingboro, 431 U.S. 85 (1977) on the topic of real estate signs in residential areas; 
e.  Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191 (1992) on the topic of election signs near polling places; 
f.  Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, 447 U.S. 557 (1980) on the topic of regulation of commercial speech; and 
g.  City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) on the topic of signs on public property. 
5.  Impact of sign clutter. Excessive signage and sign clutter impairs the legibility of the environment, and undermines the effectiveness of governmental signs, traffic control devices and other required signs (such as nameplate sign, noncommercial onsite directional sign, identification sign, onsite or on-premises wayfinding sign, and warning sign) that are essential to identifying locations for the delivery of emergency services and other compelling governmental purposes. The intent of these sign regulations is to enhance the visual environment of the city, ensure that city residents and visitors can safely navigate through the city to their intended destinations, and promote the continued well-being of the city. It is therefore the purpose of this article to promote aesthetics and the public health, safety and general welfare, and assure the adequate provision of light and air within the city through reasonable, consistent and nondiscriminatory standards for the posting, displaying, erection, use, and maintenance of signs that are no more restrictive than necessary to achieve these governmental interests. 
6.  Specific legislative intent. More specifically, the sign regulations in this article are intended to: 
a.  Encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the City; 
b.  Maintain and enhance the scenic beauty of the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; 
c.  Ensure pedestrian and traffic safety; 
d.  Minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; 
e.  Foster the integration of signage with architectural and landscape designs; 
f.  Lessen the visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation, excessive height, and excessive area of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and are not necessary to aid in wayfinding; 
g.  Allow signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation, while precluding the placement of signs that contribute to sign clutter or that conceal or obstruct adjacent land uses or signs; 
h.  Encourage and allow signs that are appropriate to the zoning district in which they are located, consistent with and serving the needs of the land uses, activities and functions to which they pertain; 
i.  Curtail the size and number of signs to the minimum reasonably necessary to identify a residential or business location, and the nature of such use, and to allow smooth navigation to these locations; 
j.  Establish dimensional limits and placement criteria for signs that are legible and proportional to the size of the lot and building on which the sign is to be placed, or to which it pertains; 
k.  Regulate signs so that they are effective in performing the function of identifying and safely directing pedestrian and vehicular traffic to a destination; 
l.  Preclude signs from conflicting with the principal permitted use of the lot and adjoining lots; 
m.  Regulate signs in a manner so as to not interfere with, obstruct the vision of, or distract motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians; 
n.  Except to the extent expressly preempted by state or federal law, ensure that signs are constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner, and protect the public from unsafe signs;

K.  Installation at outermost boundary of city public rights-of-way. Where a superior site design results from placement of a communications facility at or near the outermost boundary of the city's public right-of-way, the farthest distance practicable from the centerline of the public right-of-way and edge of pavement is encouraged. To the extent that the location of the sidewalk or multi-purpose trail within the city's public right-of-way precludes achievement of a superior site design or otherwise precludes compliance with all other requirements of this article, then the city engineer or registrant may propose and the registrant may include in the permit application a proposed re-routing of the sidewalk or multi-purpose trail at its own expense, in order to achieve such superior site design or otherwise meet other requirements of this article. Communications facilities otherwise prohibited by this section shall be permitted if installed on an existing structure or repurposed structure located in these restricted areas, subject to any future relocation of the existing structure or repurposed structure to accommodate the sidewalk or multi-purpose trail. 
L.  Distance separation between communications facility poles and wireless support structures in city public rights-of-way. Communications facility poles and wireless support structures in the city's public rights-of-way must be spaced a minimum of five hundred (500) linear feet apart from each other, along the line of general vehicular travel, except that no distance requirement shall apply to collocations or existing structures. 
M.  Site triangles. Except on existing structures, no new communications facility shall be constructed or installed within a triangular shaped area of land, known as a "site triangle", and measured in accordance with FDOT standards. 
N.  Emphasis on arterial or collector roadways. Registrants seeking to place or maintain a communications facility pole or a wireless support structure in the city's public rights-of-way shall locate their facilities in arterial or collector roadways, whenever possible. An application for a permit to place a communications facility pole or a wireless support structure in a city public right-of-way other than arterial or collector roadways shall explain why the applicant is unable to locate the facilities in an arterial or collector roadway and shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city engineer the need to locate the facilities in the areas proposed in the application. The preceding sentence shall not apply to applications for small wireless facilities. Upon delegation to the city of the regulatory authorities in this article by the county, state or U.S. Department of Transportation or all of the foregoing entities, then the city may enforce such regulations in this article within the corporate boundaries of the city to the extent such authority has been delegated to the city as stated above. 
O.  Prohibition against placement in a front yard within residential zoned districts; distance from residential structures. No communications facility pole or wireless support structure (excluding repurposed structures) shall be placed within a city public right-of-way that abuts any front yard in a residential zoned district.

P.  Limitation on placement in comer yards within residential zoned districts. A communications facility pole or a wireless support structure within the city public rights-of way abutting a corner yard of a corner lot within a residential zoned district shall not be placed any closer than ten (10) feet from the side property line of the lot abutting and adjacent to the comer lot. 
Q.  Not significantly impair view from principal structures within residential zoned districts. All communications facility poles or a wireless support structures shall be located such that views from principal structures within residential zoned districts are not significantly impaired. Where possible, newly installed communications facility poles or wireless support structures should be located in areas with existing foliage or other aesthetic features in order to obscure the view of the communications facility pole or wireless support structure within residential zoned districts. The requirements of this subparagraph shall not apply to existing structures, when there is a one-to-one use or repurposing of an existing structure. 
R.  Waiver of the requirements of this section by city commission. Nothing in section 105-40 shall be construed to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral use of city public rights-ofway by communications service providers, communications facility providers or pass-through providers, in violation of federal or state law. The waiver provisions listed in this subsection apply in those circumstances where a communications service provider, communications facility provider or pass-through provider's competitively use of city public rights-of-way is impaired by strict application of the requirements of this section 105-40. The city commission shall have the jurisdiction to grant or deny waivers as set forth in this subsection.

(2)  Contents. The request for waiver shall contain each subsection within section 105-40 for which a waiver is sought. A request for a waiver shall include all information described in this subsection (R) and any other information the city may reasonably require to process the waiver request. The city commission may deny the request for a waiver if it does not comply with the requirements of this section 105-40(R). 
(3)  Factors. The city commission shall consider the following factors and information, which shall be supplied by the applicant in the waiver request, in determining whether to grant a waiver: 
(i)  A detailed explanation, with supporting engineering or other data, as to why a waiver from the requirements of section 105-40 is required in order to allow the registrant/applicant to have nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral use of the city's public rights-of-way; 
(ii)  Availability of collocation opportunities; 
(iii)  Size and height of the proposed facilities; 
(iv)  Location and separation distances of the proposed facilities; 
(v)  Nature and characteristics of surrounding neighborhood; 
(vi)  Adjacent and nearby topography, tree coverage and foliage of surrounding neighborhood; 
(vii)  Design of the proposed facilities with particular reference to achieving compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood and elimination of adverse visual impacts of such facilities on the surrounding neighborhood; 
(viii)  Any other factors the city determines to be relevant and that may be considered under applicable law. 
(4)  Conditions. In granting any waiver, the city commission may impose conditions to the extent the city commission concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed facility on the surrounding neighborhood or to protect the health, safety and welfare of the city and its residents. 
(5)  Four-fifths vote required; criteria. The city commission shall have authority to grant a waiver upon a four-fifths (?) vote of the city commission if the applicant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that each of the below criteria have been met in the application for a waiver:

B.  Remedies. Nothing in this article shall affect or limit the remedies the city has available under applicable law. 
C.  Conditional use of public rights-of-way. In the event registrant desires to use its existing facilities or to construct new facilities for the purpose of providing other utility or non-utility services to existing or potential consumers or resellers, by providing any other services other than the provision of communications service, or for providing any other use to existing or potential consumers, a registrant shall seek such additional and separate authorization from city for such activities as may be required by applicable law. 
D.  Lawful exercise of city's rights. To the extent that any person or registrant leases or otherwise uses the facilities of a person that is duly registered or otherwise authorized to place or maintain facilities in the public rights-of-way of the city, such person or registrant shall make no claim, nor assert any right, which will impede the lawful exercise of the city's rights, including, but not limited to, requiring the removal of such facilities from the public rights-of-way of the city, regardless of the effect on registrant's ability to place or maintain its own communications facilities in public rights-of-way of the city.

The umbrella or excess liability shall have an aggregate limit not less than the highest "each occurrence" limit for commercial general liability, business auto liability or employer's liability. The city shall be specifically endorsed as an "additional insured" on the umbrella or excess liability, unless the certificate of insurance states the umbrella or excess liability provides coverage on a "follow-form" basis. 
h.  Self-insurance. Registrant may satisfy the insurance requirements and conditions of this section under a self-insurance plan and/or retention. Registrant agrees to notify the city, and/or indicate on the certificate of insurance, when self-insurance is relied upon or when a self-insured retention exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00).

3.  Right to review. The city reserves the right to review, modify, reject or accept any required policies of insurance or self-insurance, including limits, coverages, or endorsements, herein from time to time throughout the life of this section. The city reserves the right, but not the obligation, to review and reject any insurer or self-insurer providing coverage because of its poor financial condition or failure to operate legally. 
B.  No waiver of rights; insurance requirement. This section shall not be construed to affect in any way the city's rights, privileges and immunities as set forth in F.S. § 768.28. Insurance under this section shall run continuously with the presence of the registrant's facilities in the public right-of-way and any termination or lapse of such insurance shall be a violation of this section and subject to the remedies as set forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may, in its sole discretion, require increased or decreased levels of insurance for any other object placed in the city's rights-of-way. 
C.  Indemnification. By virtue of its use of city rights-of-way, a registrant shall, at its sole cost and expense, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, hold harmless and defend the city, its officials, boards, members, agents and employees, against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, judgments for damages or equitable relief, and costs and expenses incurred by the city arising out of the placement or maintenance of its communications system or facilities in public rights-of-way, regardless of whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by this article, provided, however, that a registrant's obligation hereunder shall not extend to any damages caused solely by the negligence, gross negligence or wanton or willful acts of the city. This provision includes, but is not limited to, the city's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit or proceedings. The city agrees to notify the registrant, in writing, within a reasonable time of city receiving written notice, of any issue it determines may require indemnification. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city from participating in the defense of any litigation by its own counsel and at its own cost if in the city's reasonable belief there exists or may exist a conflict, potential conflict or appearance of a conflict. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted: 
1.  As denying to either party any remedy or defense available to such party under the laws of the State of Florida; 
2.  As consent by the city to be sued; or 
3.  As a waiver of sovereign immunity beyond the waiver provided in F.S. § 768.28, as it may be amended. 
D.  Bond. 
1.  Prior to performing any permitted work in the public rights-of-way, the city may require the registrant to establish in the city's favor a construction bond to secure the restoration of the public rights-of-way and to ensure the registrant's faithful performance of the construction or other work in the public rights-of-way, in accordance with applicable sections of the city Code. In the event a registrant subject to such a construction bond fails to complete the work in accordance with the provisions of the permit and this article, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the registrant, or the cost of completing the work, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney's fees, up to the full amount of the bond. 
2.  No less than twelve (12) months after completion of the construction and satisfaction of all obligations in accordance with the bond, the registrant may request the public works/utilities director or designee to remove the requirement to continue the construction bond and the city shall release the bond within ten (10) days. Notwithstanding, the city may require a new bond for any subsequent work performed in the public rights-of-way. 
3.  The construction bond shall be issued by a surety having a minimum rating of A-1 in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition; shall be subject to the approval of the city attorney; and shall provide that: 
"Unless released by the city, this bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until thirty (30) days after receipt by the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew." 
4.  The rights reserved by the city with respect to any construction bond established pursuant to this section are in addition to all other rights and remedies the city may have under this section, or at law or equity, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to the construction bond will affect any other right the city may have. 
E.  Fees, costs and bond amounts. To the extent permitted by law, the registrant shall reimburse the city for all costs of consultants, contractors, or legal counsel incurred in the registration process and any reviews and inspections and legal documents required as part of this process. The city may also impose a reasonable fee, adopted by resolution, to the extent permitted by law. Permit fees and bonds shall be calculated in accordance with article 145, permits, fees and bonds.

Sec. 105-80. - Enforcement remedies. 
A.  Remedies.

2.  In addition to or instead of any other remedy, the city may seek legal or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
3.

B.  No waiver of rights. Failure of the city to enforce any requirements of this article shall not constitute a waiver of the city's right to enforce that violation or subsequent violations of the same type or to seek appropriate enforcement remedies. 
C.  Registrant's opportunity to respond. In any proceeding before the city where there exists an issue with respect to a registrant's performance of its obligations pursuant to this article, the registrant shall be given the opportunity to provide such information as it may have concerning its compliance with the terms and conditions of this article.

Sec. 105-100. - Abandonment of a communications facility. 
A.  Upon abandonment of a communications facility owned by a registrant in the public rights-of-way, the registrant shall notify the city of such abandonment within ninety (90) days. The city may direct the registrant by written notice to remove all or any portion of such abandoned facility at the registrant's sole expense if the city determines that the abandoned facility's presence interferes with the public health, safety or welfare, which shall include, but shall not be limited to, a determination that such facility: 
1.  Compromises safety at any time for any public rights-of-way user or during construction or maintenance in public rights-of-way. 
2.  Prevents another person from locating facilities in the area of public rights-of-way where the abandoned facility is located when other alternative locations are not reasonably available.

Sec. 105-120. - Small wireless facilities. 
A.  Registration required; application. A person that desires to place or maintain a small wireless facility in public rights-of-way within the city shall first register with the city in accordance with section 105-20 of the city Code. As part of any permit application to place a new or replace an existing small wireless facility in the public rights-of-way, the registrant shall provide a proposal to the city that includes the information required under subsection 105-30(B) of the city Code, to the extent such information may be requested under applicable state law, and information documenting compliance with the applicable codes, including, but not limited to, the design standards applicable to small wireless facilities. 
B.  Location; alternative location procedure. Small wireless facilities shall not be subject to the minimum separation distances set forth in section 105-40 of the city Code, except as expressly permitted by law. Within fourteen (14) days after the date of filing a complete application for a small wireless facility, the city may request that the proposed location of a small wireless facility be moved to another location in the right-of-way and placed on an alternative city utility pole or support structure or may place a new utility pole. The city and the applicant may negotiate the alternative location, including any objective design standards and reasonable spacing requirements for ground-based equipment, for thirty (30) days after the date of the request. At the conclusion of the negotiation period, if the alternative location is accepted by the applicant, the applicant must notify the city of such acceptance and the application shall be deemed granted for any new location for which there is agreement and all other locations in the application. If an agreement is not reached, the applicant must notify the city of such non-agreement and the city shall grant or deny the original application within ninety (90) days after the date the application was filed. A request for an alternative location, an acceptance of an alternative location, or a rejection of an alternative location must be in writing and provided by electronic mail. 
C.  Collocation application process. Within fourteen (14) days after receiving an application for a permit to collocate a small wireless facility, the city shall determine and notify the applicant by electronic mail as to whether the application is complete. If an application is deemed incomplete, the city shall specifically identify the missing information. An application is deemed complete if the city fails to provide notification to the applicant within fourteen (14) days. Pursuant to F.S. § 337.401(7), as amended from time to time, a complete application to collocate a small wireless facility is deemed approved if the city fails to approve or deny the application within sixty (60) days after receipt of the application. If the city does not use the thirty-day negotiation period provided in subsection (B) above, the parties may mutually agree to extend the sixty-day application review period. The city shall grant or deny the application at the end of the extended period. A permit issued pursuant to an approved collocation application shall remain effective for one (1) year unless extended by the city. 
D.  Consolidated application. An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities within the city may, at the applicant's discretion, file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the collocation of up to thirty (30) small wireless facilities.

E.  Written approval or denial. The city shall notify the applicant of approval or denial by electronic mail. The city shall approve a complete application unless it does not meet the applicable codes. If the application is denied, the city shall specify in writing the basis for denial, including the specific code provision(s) on which the denial was based, and send the documentation to the applicant by electronic mail on the day the city denies the application. The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the city and resubmit the application within thirty (30) days after notice of the denial is sent to the applicant. The city shall approve or deny the revised application within thrity (30) days after receipt or the application is deemed approved. Any subsequent review shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial. 
F.  Basis for denial. The city may deny a proposed collocation of a small wireless facility in the public rights-of-way if the proposed collocation: 
(1)  Materially interferes with the safe operation of traffic control equipment; 
(2)  Materially interferes with sight lines or clear zones for transportation, pedestrians, or public safety purposes; 
(3)  Materially interferes with compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar federal or state standards regarding pedestrian access or movement: 
(4)  Materially fails to comply with the 2010 edition of the Florida Department of Transportation Utility Accommodation Manual; or 
(5)  Fails to comply with applicable codes. 
G.  Height. The height of a small wireless facility shall not exceed ten (10) feet above the utility pole or structure upon which the small wireless facility is to be collocated. The height for a new utility pole is limited to the tallest existing utility pole as of July 1, 2017, located in the same right-of-way, other than a utility pole for which a waiver has previously been granted, measured from grade in place within five hundred (500) feet of the proposed location of the small wireless facility. If there is no utility pole within five hundred (500) feet, the height of the utility pole upon which the small wireless facility is to be collocated shall not exceed fifty (50) feet and shall only be as high as reasonably necessary to achieve its intended purpose. 
H.  Collocation on city utility poles. 
(1)  The rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a city utility pole shall be one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per pole annually, or the maximum amount permitted under applicable law, whichever is greater. 
(2)  The city may reserve space on city utility poles for future public safety uses. If replacement of the city utility pole is necessary to accommodate the collocation of the small wireless facility and the future public safety use, the pole replacement is subject to make-ready provisions and the replaced pole shall accommodate the future public safety use. 
(3)  For a city utility pole that supports an aerial facility used to provide communication services or electrical service, the city and applicant shall comply with the process for make-ready work under 47 U.S.C. § 224 and implementing regulations. The good faith estimate of the city for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation will include pole replacement, if necessary. 
(4)  For a city utility pole that does not support an aerial facility used to provide communications services or electric service, the authority shall provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation, including necessary pole replacement, within sixty (60) days after receipt of a complete application. Make-ready work, including any pole replacement, shall be completed within sixty (60) days after written acceptance of the good faith estimate by the applicant. Alternatively, the city may require the applicant seeking to collocate a small wireless facility to provide a make-ready estimate at the applicant's expense for the work necessary to support the small wireless facility, including pole replacement, and perform the make-ready work. If pole replacement is required, the scope of the make-ready estimate is limited to the design, fabrication, and installation of a utility pole that is substantially similar in color and composition. 
(5)  The make-ready work specified in subsections (3) and (4) above shall be subject to the city's usual construction restoration standards for work in the right-of-way. The replaced or altered city utility pole shall remain the property of the city. 
I.  Design standards. The city's design standards set forth in this article and the applicable codes may be waived by the city commission upon a showing that the design standards are not reasonably compatible for the particular location of a small wireless facility or that the design standards impose an excessive expense for a small wireless facility. The waiver shall be granted or denied within forty-five (45) days after the date of the request. 
J.  Micro wireless facilities. City approval shall not be required for the installation, placement, maintenance or replacement of micro wireless facilities that are suspended on cables strung between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable codes by or for a communications services provider authorized to occupy the public rights-of-way and who is remitting taxes under F.S. ch. 202. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may require a right-of-way permit for work that involves excavation, closure of a sidewalk or closure of a vehicular lane. 
K.  Permitting. An applicant for installation of a small wireless facility shall obtain a right-of-way permit from the city, except to the extent applicable law prohibits the city from requiring a permit. 
L.  Airport airspace. A structure granted a permit and installed pursuant to this section shall comply with F.S. ch. 333, and federal regulations pertaining to airport airspace protections. 
M.  No application to locations subject to HOA restrictions. This section does not authorize a person to collocate small wireless facilities or micro wireless facilities on a city utility pole or erect a wireless support structure in a location subject to covenants, conditions, restrictions, articles of incorporation, and bylaws of a homeowners' association. 
N.  Prohibition against placement in location where facilities are placed underground.

ARTICLE 110. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT - ADMINISTRATION 

Sec. 110-10. - General. 
A.  Title. These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of The City of Parkland, hereinafter referred to as "this ordinance." 
B.  Scope. The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including, but not limited to, the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
C.  Intent. The purpose of this ordinance and the flood load and flood-resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
1.  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
2.  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
3.  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
4.  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
5.  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
6.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
7.  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
8.  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
D.  Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This ordinance is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
E.  Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this ordinance. 
F.  Disclaimer of liability. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of city commission of the City of Parkland or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 110-20. - Applicability. 
A.  General. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable. 
B.  Areas to which this ordinance applies. This ordinance shall apply to all flood hazard areas within the City of Parkland, as established in section 110-20.C. of this ordinance. 
C.  Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. The Flood Insurance Study for Broward County, Florida, and Incorporated Areas, dated August 18, 2014, and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this ordinance and shall serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that establish flood hazard areas are on file at the Building Department, 6600 North University Drive. 
D.  Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas. To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to section 110-50 of this ordinance the floodplain administrator may require submission of additional data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the community indicates that ground elevations: 
1.  Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this ordinance and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
2.  Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 
E.  Other laws. The provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law. 
F.  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This ordinance supersedes any ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances including, but not limited to, land development regulations, zoning ordinances, stormwater management regulations, or the Florida Building Code. In the event of a conflict between this ordinance and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern. This ordinance shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject to such interests shall also be governed by this ordinance. 
G.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this ordinance, all provisions shall be: 
1.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
2.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
3.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

6.  The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
7.  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
8.  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
9.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
10.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
H.  Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
1.  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this ordinance or the required elevation standards; 
2.  Determination by the City of Parkland City Commission that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
3.  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
4.  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Editor's note- The attachment referenced in this section is not included herein but is available in the office of the city clerk. 
Sec. 125-20. - Drainage plan. 
    As a condition precedent to the granting of any building permit, an applicant must submit for approval a drainage plan designed to effect a runoff of all surface water to the side and main drainage swales on applicant's lot in accordance with original Pine Tree Estates Swale and Drainage Plan. In effectuating a main drainage plan, clean fill, free of organic or foreign material, must be used; however, nothing herein shall be construed to prevent an owner from utilizing existing fill on his/her lot so long as said fill is not considered deleterious material or mucky so as to prevent proper water percolation. The city engineer shall have the authority to require said drainage plan to be signed and sealed by a State of Florida Professional Engineer if at the city's engineer's discretion said signature and seal are warranted, in which case plans shall be accompanied by applicable supporting calculations. These calculations and designs shall be in compliance with the South Florida Water Management District's Permit Information Manual as revised from time to time, Permit Critical Manual for Stormwater Management Regulations, standards and procedures for the Pine Tree Water Control District (PTWCD), and/or City of Parkland drainage standards as revised from time to time, whichever is more stringent. In addition, the city engineer may require any other documentation including, but not limited to, permits and licenses issued by any agency having jurisdiction. 
    Plans must be submitted to the Pine Tree Water Control District for review. A non-objection letter from the district must be provided to the city as a condition to obtain a building permit.

After the city manager or designee has determined that the application is ready to be processed, the application shall be forwarded, as applicable, depending on the type of application, to the appropriate staff, the planning and zoning board, and the city commission pursuant to the requirements of this article, in accordance with applicable law. The city commission shall consider the application, the recommendation planning and zoning board, conduct a community appearance review where applicable, the city manager or designee's recommendation, and any additional evidence presented by the applicant, city staff and the public. 
5.  Any decision of the city commission to deny an application shall authorize the city manager or designee to set forth in writing the city commission's reasons for the denial. It is the intent of this section to establish a procedure for compliance with the "written decision" and "substantial evidence" requirements of the Telecommunications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(B)(iii). 
6.  The city shall grant or deny each properly completed application for a collocation based on the application's compliance with this article, applicable provisions of the City Code and any other applicable regulations, and within the normal timeframe for a similar building permit review but in no case later than forty-five (45) business days after the date the application is determined to be properly completed. This timeframe shall not apply to lease negotiations for collocation on city-owned property. Eligible facilities shall be subject to the requirements set forth in section 150-130, installations on municipal property. 
7.  The city shall grant or deny each properly completed application for any other wireless communications facility based on the application's compliance with this article and any other applicable law, including, but not limited to, the City Code and within the normal timeframe for a similar type of review, but in no case later than ninety (90) business days after the date the application is determined to be properly completed. This timeframe shall not apply to lease negotiations for wireless communications facilities on city-owned property. 
8.  An application is deemed submitted or resubmitted on the date the application is received by the city. If the city does not notify the applicant in writing that the application is not completed in compliance with the city's regulations within twenty (20) business days after the date the application is initially submitted or additional information resubmitted, the application is deemed, for administrative purposes only, to be properly completed and properly submitted. However, the determination shall not be deemed as an approval of the application. If the application is not completed in compliance with the city's regulations, the city shall so notify the applicant in writing indicating with specificity any deficiencies in the required documents or deficiencies in the content of the required documents which, if cured, would make the application properly completed. Upon resubmission of information to cure the stated deficiencies, the city shall notify the applicant, in writing, within the normal timeframes of review, but in no case longer than twenty (20) business days after the additional information is submitted, of any remaining deficiencies that must be cured. However, if applicant does not cure the application deficiencies within twenty (20) business days after receiving the notice of deficiencies, the application shall be considered withdrawn or closed unless an extension due to reasonable circumstances of the time to cure is requested by the applicant prior to the expiration of the twenty-day period and such extension is granted by the city manager. 
9.  The timeframes specified above may be extended, only to the extent that the application has not been granted or denied, because the city's procedures generally applicable to all other similar types of applications require action by the city commission and/or planning and zoning board, and such action has not taken place within the specified timeframes. Under such circumstances, the city commission or planning and zoning board, as applicable, shall either grant or deny the application at its next regularly scheduled meeting, or, otherwise, the application shall be deemed automatically to be approved; accordingly, the city manager or designee may by letter to the applicant extend the timeframe for a decision until the next available scheduled meeting date of the city commission and/or planning and zoning board as to whether to grant or deny an application for a permit taken pursuant to this article. 
10.  The city may request, but not require, a waiver of the timeframes by the applicant, except that, with respect to a specific application. The city may require a one-time waiver in the case of a declared local, state, or federal emergency that directly affects the administration of all permitting activities of the city. 
11.  The city may enter into an entry and testing agreement with the wireless communications facility owner, applicant and/or operator, in a form approved by the city attorney, without approval of the city commission. 
12.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city and an applicant may voluntarily agree to waive the timeframes set forth above. 
13.  Appeal. If an application is denied by the city manager or designee for noncompliance with the requirements of this article then the applicant may appeal this decision to the city commission within ten (10) business days of the decision to be appealed. The appeal shall set forth the grounds for the appeal in writing. The city commission shall hear the appeal within fifteen (15) business days of its filing and rule on the appeal within three (3) days of the hearing on the appeal. 
14.  Modification of development standards. If an applicant seeks a modification to the wireless communications facility development standards antenna, antenna array, attachment device, equipment enclosure and/or any ancillary equipment provided in this division, the applicant shall provide the nature of the specific relief sought and the legal or engineering justification to demonstrate that, without such relief, applicability of the regulations would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of reliable and feasible personal wireless services. The application shall be heard by the city commission within thirty (30) days of the day it is filed. There shall be no fee charged for seeking this relief except for payment of any expert the city is required to retain to review the request.

Additional standards are set forth in section 150-90, standards for telecommunications towers, and section 150-100, standards for antennas, below and elsewhere in this article. 
B.  The development, construction, maintenance and repair of wireless communications facilities are subject to the regulatory supervision of the city to the full extent permitted by applicable law and shall be performed in compliance with all laws, ordinances and practices affecting such facility including, but not limited to, zoning codes, building codes, and safety codes, and as provided in this article. Unless excepted herein or by applicable state or federal law, no application for development or construction of a wireless communications facility shall be approved by the city unless and until, pursuant to F.S. § 365.172(12)(b)(l), all applicable requirements relating to aesthetics, landscaping, land use based location priorities, structural design, setbacks, and all other applicable regulations have been addressed by the applicant and reviewed and approved by the city. 
C.  All proposed telecommunications towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, including emissions standards, and any other agency of the local, state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas prior to issuance of a building permit by the city. If such applicable standards and regulations are revised and require that existing facilities adhere to such revised standards, then the owners of telecommunications towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within ninety (90) calendar days of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is established by the controlling agency or other applicable law. Failure to bring into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the telecommunications tower, antenna or wireless communications facility at the owner's expense. 
D.  To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications towers installed, the owner shall construct and maintain telecommunications tower in compliance with the applicable building code, and all other applicable codes and standards. A statement shall be submitted to the city by an engineer licensed to practice in the state or by an engineer exempt from such requirement under state law certifying compliance with this section upon completion of construction and/or subsequent modification. Where an existing structure or pole is requested as a stealth facility, the stealth facility, and all modifications thereof, shall comply with all requirements as provided in this article and all other applicable standards as may be amended from time to time. 
E.  Inspections. 
1.  The city reserves the right to conduct annual inspection of wireless communications facilities at the owner's expense, to ensure compliance with this article and other applicable codes and regulations. The city may conduct more frequent inspections of wireless communications facilities, should there be an emergency or extraordinary conditions. 
2.  If, upon inspection, the city concludes that a wireless communications facility fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner, the owner shall commence work within thirty (30) calendar days to bring such wireless communications facility into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such wireless communications facility into compliance within sixty (60) calendar days of notice, which may be extended up to ninety (90) days by the city manager if the owner is working in good faith to cure, shall constitute grounds for requiring the removal of the facility at the owner's expense. 
3.  The city reserves the right to require additional inspections if there is evidence that a tower or a wireless communications facility has a safety problem or is exposed to extraordinary conditions. 
F.  Wireless communications facilities in residential and agricultural zoning districts. The city prohibits the placement of a wireless communications facility in a residential zoning district unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city that it cannot reasonably provide its personal wireless service to the residential area or zone from outside the residential area or zone. In such a case, the city and the applicant shall cooperate to determine an appropriate location for a wireless communication facility of an appropriate design within the residential area or zone. The applicant shall reimburse any and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city for this cooperative determination, including attorney's fees. Such application for cooperation shall be accompanied by an application fee in the same amount as for a new tower. The cooperation application shall not be subject to the timeframes contained in this article for granting and denying applications, but the city and the applicant shall cooperate to complete the review within a reasonable amount of time. In any case, even if required to be permitted, the tower shall be a stealth tower. This section does not prohibit attached wireless communication facilities on multifamily residential buildings to the extent permitted in section 150-50, attached wireless communications facilities. 
G.  Hierarchy of zoning districts and siting alternatives. Development of a wireless communications facility shall be permitted in the following preferred zoning districts and in accordance with the following siting alternatives hierarchies. 
1.  For towers, the preferred zoning districts order of ranking, including public rights-of-way in any such zoning district, is from highest one (1) to eleven (11). Where a lower ranked alternative is proposed, the applicant must demonstrate in its application that higher ranked options are not available. The availability of a less expensive lease on a lower ranked site is not sufficient in and of itself to justify using the lower ranked alternative where a higher ranked alterative is otherwise available. 
a.  I-1 Industrial. 
b.  C-R Commercial Recreation District. 
c.  Utilities. 
d.  CF, Community Facilities District. 
e.  OS Recreation/Open Space.

C.  [Unstaffed equipment building dimensions.] Any related unstaffed equipment building shall not contain more than three hundred (300) square feet of gross floor area but may be up to four hundred (400) square feet in gross floor area if the city approves placement of a generator within such equipment facility, but should not be more than ten (10) feet in height; 
D.  Aircraft hazard. Prior to the issuance of a permit by the city, the application shall provide evidence that the telecommunications tower or antenna is in compliance with FAA regulations. Where an antenna will not exceed the highest point of the existing structure upon which it is to be mounted, such evidence shall not be required. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 150-110. - Special provisions for certain eligible facilities modifications. 
A.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the city shall not deny any eligible facilities' request for a modification to an existing wireless tower or base station which does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station provided the procedure and requirements set forth in B. below are satisfied, 
B.  In order to obtain approval under this subsection the applicant shall file an application on a form provided by the city and shall be obligated to demonstrate conclusively that the proposed modification satisfies the standards set forth above and that the modification shall meet all applicable building codes. The application shall provide an accurate visual representation of the effect of the proposed modification to the tower or the base station. 
C.  The city shall act on any such request within forty-five (45) days of receipt of a completed application which satisfies the requirements set forth above. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 150-120. - Use of public rights-of-way (ROW). 
A.  A service provider that desires to place or maintain a wireless communications facility in the public rights-of-way in the city shall first register with the city in accordance with subsection 105-20.D. Any wireless communications facilities subsequently constructed or installed shall comply with this article. 
B.  No telecommunications towers or equipment facilities may be installed or placed in the ROW, with the exception that a stealth antenna may be placed on any pole that has already been installed or placed in the ROW with the consent of the pole owner, subject to the standards in this section provided the height of the stealth antenna does not extend more than eight (8) feet above the top of such pole. An existing pole may be modified, replaced or re-built in substantially the same location to accommodate a stealth antenna so long as the height of such pole is not increased by more than eight (8) feet from its existing height. Associated equipment facilities shall be placed as forth below. Modified, replaced or re-built poles including the stealth antennas shall not exceed twenty-five (25) feet above grade level. 
C.  No telecommunications towers or equipment facilities shall be permitted on city-owned property with the exception of a stealth antenna on a pole permitted by the city in a license agreement approved at a public hearing noticed as provided herein. The city shall have no obligation to enter into a license agreement. The standards below for stealth antennas in the ROW shall apply to any license together with any additional conditions imposed by the city in the license agreement. 
D.  Development standards. 
1.  Stealth antennas to be installed in the ROW, including any accompanying equipment facilities, shall be subject to all requirements of this article and all site plan review and permitting requirements of the city. 
2.  When installing a stealth antenna on a pole, any and all associated equipment facilities shall be placed in any of the following areas: 
a.  Underground in the ROW; or 
b.  On an adjacent property, with the consent of the property owner provided that all the wiring is underground and all setback requirements are met; or 
c.  Above ground flush-mounted on the pole, provided the equipment facilities do not exceed the diameter or width of the pole at point of mounting, subject to review and approval by the community appearance board; or 
d.  Equipment cabinets to service antennas placed in the rights-of-way of may be placed in proximity to the pole within the rights-of-way, but must be no larger than three (3) feet by three (3) feet by six (6) feet and must be designed, and/or screened to aesthetically conform to landscaping and building structures in the immediate vicinity of such installation and shall be partially buried or otherwise camouflaged in such a manner as the city manager or designee may dictate. Equipment cabinets shall be placed underground if it is not commercially impracticable to do so. Mini-cellular technology shall be used to eliminate the need for equipment cabinets on the ground where it is not commercially impracticable to do so. The placement of equipment cabinets shall not cause a conflict with other public and private utilities in such right-of-way and shall be located in a manner that will allow public and private utilities to share such right-of-way with such equipment cabinets. 
3.  Before installing any stealth antenna on any pole already installed in the ROW, an applicant must complete the antenna application pursuant to this article and must also comply with the other applicable sections of this article. An application pursuant to this section shall not be deemed a collocation application. 
4.  No antenna may be installed under this section until the applicant fully complies with all the indemnification and insurance requirements of this article. 
5.  The city commission may grant a special exception to the prohibition on new poles to accommodate wireless communication facilities in cases where the applicant can demonstrate: the location of the utility poles is necessary to cover existing deficiencies in coverage or capacity and where it can demonstrate the collocation is not feasible, and that based on such showing, it has a right under existing state or federal law to locate a new pole within public right-of-way. 
a.  Notwithstanding any federal or state requirements with respect to placement wireless communications facilities in the right-of-way, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within the public rights-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests to place and maintain facilities in that area of the public rights-of-way, for the protection of existing facilities in the public rights-of-way, or to accommodate city plans for public improvements or projects that the city determines are in the public interest and to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or where there the request will interfere with the public's use of the right-of-way, or where the facility would pose a threat to public safety. 
b.  All wireless communications facilities shall be placed and maintained so as not to interfere in any material way with the use of the public rights-of-way by the public and so as not to cause materially interference with the rights and convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the public rights-of-way. The applicant shall endeavor to install all wireless communications facilities underground to the extent feasible; the height or size of any wireless communications facility shall be limited to the extent feasible. To the extent not inconsistent with public service commission regulations, the city may require the use of trenchless technology (i.e., directional bore method) for the installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way as well as joint trenching or the co-location of facilities in existing conduit. In making such requests, the city shall take into consideration several factors including inconvenience to the public and other users of rights-of-way and the economic and technical feasibility of such requests. The applicant shall be liable for the displacement, damage or destruction of any property, irrigation system or landscaping as a result of the placement or maintenance of its facility within the public rights-of-way. The applicant shall be required to site any approved facility to minimize the visual effect of the facility. The appropriate city official may issue such rules and regulations concerning the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way as may be consistent with this article and other applicable law. 
c.  Any tower or pole shall be stealth and shall not exceed twenty-five (25) feet in height. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 150-130. - Installations on municipal property. 
    Applications for a new telecommunications tower on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the city, except for public rights-of-way, shall require a license agreement approved by the city commission and executed by the city and the owner of the proposed wireless communications facility. The approval must be by resolution. This requirement shall not apply to collocations or ground space licenses where the ground space is less than four hundred (400) square feet. A license agreement for a new tower on municipal property shall only be effective if approved by the city commission after notice to all property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the parcel upon which the tower is to be located. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 150-140. - Interference with public safety communications. 
A.  To the extent not inconsistent with applicable federal law, all providers of personal wireless services and all owners and/or operators of wireless communications facilities, shall not cause interference with the operations of public safety communications services. Should any such interference occur, it shall be the responsibility of the owner of the wireless communications facility to rectify the interference immediately. 
B.  To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, if a provider of personal wireless services or the owner or operator of a wireless communications facility, refuses to stop the interference or to cease transmitting signals as required herein, the city may file a complaint with the FCC for resolution and/or seek an injunction against it pursuant to F.S. § 843.025, that makes it unlawful for any person to deprive a law enforcement officer of his or her radio or to otherwise deprive the officer of the means to summon assistance, or pursue any other remedy authorized by applicable law. Any person who is found to have violated this section shall be punished as provided by applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 150-150. - Replacement or modification of a wireless communications facility. 
A.  A telecommunications tower that is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna shall be of the same telecommunications tower type as the existing telecommunications tower, unless the city allows reconstruction as a monopole pursuant to this section. 
B.  An existing telecommunications tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height to accommodate an additional antenna. Such modification or rebuild of the telecommunications tower shall require the approval of the city commission. The new height shall comply with the requirements of this article. 
C.  A telecommunications tower that is being rebuilt to accommodate an additional antenna and which requires movement on-site from its existing location shall require an application for a new tower. After the telecommunications tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation, only one (1) telecommunications tower may remain on the site. A relocated onsite telecommunications tower shall continue to be measured from the original telecommunications tower location for purposes of calculating separation distances between towers pursuant to this section. The relocation of a telecommunications tower pursuant to this section shall not be deemed to cause a violation of the separation requirements contained herein. 
D.  Modification of existing wireless communications facility. Minor modification of a wireless communications facility shall not require an additional approval so long as the modification does not change the height of the telecommunications tower, enlarge the antenna array, enlarge the equipment facility and does not involve any collocation. All other modifications shall require approval pursuant to the requirements of this article. 
E.  Any pre-existing tower, including a nonconforming tower, may be structurally modified to permit collocation or may be replaced through no more than administrative review for compliance with this article and building permit review, and is not subject to public hearing review, if the overall height of the tower is not increased and, if the replacement tower is a monopole tower or, if the pre-existing tower is a stealth tower, the replacement tower is a similar stealth tower. 
F.  Rebuilding damaged or destroyed nonconforming towers or antennas. Legal nonconforming telecommunications towers or antennas that are damaged or destroyed may be rebuilt subject to the provisions of this article. Building permits to rebuild the facility shall comply with the then applicable building codes and shall be obtained within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days from the date the facility is damaged or destroyed. If no permit is obtained or if the permit expires, the telecommunications tower or antenna shall be deemed abandoned as specified herein. 
(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 2(Exh. A), 9-21-2015) 
Sec. 150-160. - Indemnification, insurance, security funds, and violations. 
A.  Indemnification. The city shall not enter into any lease agreement with any provider for the use of city-owned property for installation of wireless communications facilities until and unless the city obtains an adequate indemnity from such provider. The indemnity must at least: 
1.  Release the city from and against any and all liability and responsibility in or arising out of the construction, operation or repair of the wireless communications facility. 
2.  Indemnify and hold harmless the city, its trustees, elected and appointed officers, agents, servants and employees, from and against any and all claims, demands, or causes of action of whatsoever kind or nature, and the resulting losses, costs, expenses, reasonable attorneys' fees, liabilities, damages, orders, judgments, or decrees, sustained by the city or any third party arising out of, or by reason of, or resulting from or of each wireless communications facility operator, or its agents, employees, or servants negligent acts, errors, or omissions. 
3.  Provide that the covenants and representations relating to the indemnification provision shall survive following the term of any agreement and continue in full force and effect for at least one (1) year following the termination of the party's agreement as to the party's responsibility to indemnify. 
4.  In no event shall the city indemnify a service provider and/or the owner or operator of a wireless communications facility. 
B.  Insurance. The city shall not grant or approve an application for the installation of a tower, antenna and/or wireless communications facility on city-owned property and shall not enter into any lease agreement for city-owned property until and unless the city obtains assurance that such applicant or lessee (and those acting on its behalf) has adequate insurance. The insurance requirements of this section may be satisfied by evidence of self-insurance acceptable to the city. At a minimum, the following requirements must be satisfied: 
1.  A wireless communications facility owner shall not commence construction or operation of the facility without obtaining all insurance required under this section and approval of such insurance by the city manager, nor shall a wireless communications facility operator allow any contractor or subcontractor to commence work on its contract or sub-contract until all similar such insurance required of the same has been obtained and approved. The required insurance must be obtained and maintained for the entire period the wireless communications facility is in existence. If the operator, its contractors or subcontractors do not have the required insurance, the city may order such entities to stop operations until the insurance is obtained and approved. 
2.  Certificates of insurance, reflecting evidence of the required insurance, shall be filed with the city. For entities that are entering the market, the certificates shall be filed prior to the commencement of construction and once a year thereafter, and as provided below in the event of a lapse in coverage. 
3.  These certificates shall contain a provision that coverage afforded under these policies will not be canceled until at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice has been given to the city. Policies shall be issued by companies authorized to do business under the laws of the state. The city may amend its requirements pertaining to insurance from time to time and may require additional provisions pertaining to such insurance in a lease. 
4.  In the event that the insurance certificate provided indicates that the insurance shall terminate or lapse during the period of the lease agreement with the city, then in that event, the wireless communications facility operator shall furnish, at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the date of such insurance, a renewed certificate of insurance as proof that equal and like coverage for the balance of the period. 
C.  Comprehensive general liability. A wireless communications facility operator and its contractors or subcontractors engaged in work on the operator's behalf, shall maintain adequate insurance to cover liability, bodily injury and property damage in the minimum amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) or in such greater amount as reasonably determined by the city at the time of application. Exposures to be covered include premises, operations, and those certain contracts relating to the construction, installation or maintenance of the wireless communications facility. Coverage shall be written on an occurrence basis. Certificates of insurance reflecting evidence of the required insurance shall be filed with the city. 
D.  [Cash security fund or irrevocable letter of credit required.] Prior to any construction on city-owned property, every service provider, shall establish a cash security fund, or provide the city with an irrevocable letter of credit subject to the city attorney's approval, in the amount specified in an agreement, permit, or other authorization as necessary to ensure the provider's faithful performance of construction and compliance with this division. The minimum amount of the security fund for each telecommunications tower shall be twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) and the minimum amount for each antenna shall be five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). 
E.  [Bond in lieu of cash security fund or letter of credit.] In the alternative, at the city's discretion, a service provider may, in lieu of a cash security fund or letter of credit, file and maintain with the city a bond in the same amounts as required in subsection (1). The provider and the surety shall be jointly and severally liable under the terms of the bond. The bond shall be issued by a surety having a minimum rating of A-1 in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition; shall be subject to the approval of the city attorney; and shall provide that: 
"This bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until 60 days after receipt by the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew." 
F.  Rights reserved by city. The rights reserved by the city with respect to any security fund or bond established pursuant to this section are in addition to all other rights and remedies the city may have under this article, a lease, or at law or equity. 
G.  Penalties. Any person, firm or corporation who knowingly breaches any provision of this division [article] shall upon receipt of written notice from the city be given a time schedule to cure the violation. Failure to commence to cure the violation within thirty (30) days and to complete cure, to the city's satisfaction, within sixty (60) days, or such longer time as the city may specify, shall result in revocation of any permit or license and the city shall seek any remedy or damages to the full extent of the law. This shall not preclude other penalties allowed by law. 
H.  Violations. 
1.  In addition to revoking any permit for placement of a wireless communications facilities in the city for violation of this article and any other remedies available at law including, but not limited to, F.S. § 166.0415 and F.S. ch. 162, or at equity or as provided in this article, the city may apply any one (1) or combination of the following remedies in the event an applicant or service provider violates this article, or applicable local law or order related to placement of such facilities in the city: 
a.  Failure to comply with the provisions of this article or other applicable law may result in imposition of penalties to be paid by the applicant or service provider to the city as provided in F.S. ch. 162, and the City Code, as they may be amended. 
b.  In addition to or instead of any other remedy, the city may seek legal or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
2.  No waiver. Failure of the city to enforce any requirements of this article shall not constitute a waiver of the city's right to enforce that violation or subsequent violations of the same type or to seek appropriate enforcement remedies.
