PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Madeira Beach, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1983 Code, as supplemented through June 1, 1999, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1983 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and William Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Denise M. Schlegel, City Clerk, Kim D. Leinbach, former City Manager, Andrew J. Salzman, City Attorney, and the other members of the city staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(d)  The failure of any member of the planning commission to attend three consecutive meetings of the planning commission or failure to attend four meetings of the planning commission in any contiguous 12-month period shall be cause for removal. However, the board of commissioners may take into consideration the reason for such absences, and may excuse the member for a reason deemed valid by the board of commissioners. 
(e)  Appointments shall be made, consistent with the Charter § 12.2 on the basis of demonstrated experience or interest in the subject matter. 
(f)  The members of the planning commission shall, in October of each year, elect a chairman, first vice-chairman and a second vice-chairman from among its members who shall be voting members. 
(g)  Members of the planning commission shall meet on the first Monday of each month, as necessary.

(f)  In order to effectuate the giving of notice by letter, the bidding authority may, in its discretion, establish procedures whereby bidders may notify the bidding authority that they wish to be notified of bids by letter. However, in no event shall any such procedures established by the bidding authority constitute a representation of any kind relating to notice by posting or advertisement. Any such procedures established by the bidding authority shall in no way constitute a waiver by the bidding authority or the city of the provision that notice, no matter how received, is given and taken subject to everything contained in notices by advertisement or posting.

In this case, the bidding authority shall prepare guidelines setting forth the object for which bids are being sought, any standards or criteria which must be observed and all other things which are necessary so that bidders can prepare proposals for alternate plans, specifications, materials, or methods. 
(d)  All plans, specifications, descriptions and guidelines shall include a section dealing with all terms, conditions and provisions which the city shall require to be included in any contract awarded a successful bidder.

(c)  Where the bidding authority indicates that the bidder is to submit proposals for alternate plans, specifications, materials and methods, or where the bidding authority does not specify in its plans and specifications the manner in which work is to be done or the methods and materials to be used, all bids submitted shall clearly indicate the manner in which work shall be done, including, where applicable, the materials and methods to be used. 
(d)  Failure to submit bids in the manner prescribed by the bidding shall be a sufficient reason for the bidding authority not to award the contract to the bidder. Where the bidding authority determines in its discretion that a bid is not sufficiently definite, the bidding authority may refuse to consider the bid in making its award, or, at its discretion, invite a clarification from the bidder. 
(Code 1983, § 18-107) 
Sec. 2-188. - Security. 
(a)  No contract may be awarded a bidder unless the bidder submits, at the time the contract is awarded, a performance bond for the amount of the contract. In its discretion, the bidding authority may waive this requirement or allow the bidder to submit a certified check or a cashier's check for the amount of the contract in lieu of a performance bond. 
(b)  The successful bidder shall be required to obtain a penal bond as required by Florida Statutes § 255.05, or as may be required by any other law or successor statute. 
(c)  The bidding authority shall have the discretion to require that all bids be submitted under the bid bond and to determine the amount of such bond. However, the bidding authority must make the determination that a bid bond is required prior to giving notice by advertisement or posting and inform all bidders of the requirement. Where the bidding authority determines that a bid bond is required, the bond shall be required of all bidders on a particular contract.

In addition, if the violation is a violation as described in subsection 2-375(d), the special magistrate shall notify the city administration which may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant with this section. If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this subsection, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. If, after due notice and hearing, a special magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in subsection (b). 
(b)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation and shall not exceed $500.00 per day for a repeat violation, and in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to subsection (a). However, if a special magistrate finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per violation. 
(c)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the special magistrate shall consider the following factors:

(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
(3)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(d)  The special magistrate may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this section. 
(e)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records of the county and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this division shall continue to accrue until the violations comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this division, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the city and the city may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section. After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the special magistrate may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on the lien or to sue to recover a money judgment for the amount of the lien plus accrued interest. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this division may be foreclosed on real property which is homestead under Section 4, Article X of the State Constitution. The money judgment provisions of this section shall not apply to real property or personal property which is covered under Section 4(a), Article X of the State Constitution. 
(f)  If the city attorney or a member of the city administration prevails in prosecuting a case before the special magistrate, the city shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case before the special magistrate. As used in this article, the term "prevails" includes, but is not limited to, those cases in which the special magistrate finds that a violation existed at the time the citation was issued without regard to whether the violation was subsequently corrected. The fine for the violation and/or costs to repair the damages from the violation is separate and district from the recovery of expenses. The special magistrate may, by written order recorded in the official records of the county, impose a lien against the property upon which the violation occurred as well as all other real and personal property of the violator in the amount of the costs incurred by the city in prosecuting the case.

Sec. 2-379. - Duration of lien.

In an action to foreclose on a lien or for a money judgment, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, to include a reasonable attorney's fee that it incurs in the foreclosure. The city shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien affected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded.

Sec. 2-504. - Powers.

(2)  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, and determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this division after public notice has been given and a public hearing has been held. 
(3)  To hear and decide special exception uses to the terms of this division upon which the special magistrate is required to pass as required therein. 
(4)  To authorize upon appeal, after public notice has been given and a public hearing held, in specific cases such variance from the terms of this division as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the land development regulations, subpart B of this Code will result in unnecessary hardship. 
(5)  To table or continue a hearing on an application if additional information is needed or requested by the special magistrate. 
(Ord. No. 1019, § 1, 5-25-04; Ord. No. 1071, § 3(Exh. A, § 2), 2-28-06) 
Sec. 2-505. - Application to appeal; public hearing. 
(a)  Applications. Applications to appeal to the special magistrate may be made by any person aggrieved or affected by any decision made by any officer or administrative official of the city under any provision of the city land development regulations, or by any person requesting a special exception use or variance, to the provision of any section or article of the land development regulations. The special magistrate may decide such appeal only after public notice has been given and a public hearing has been held. 
(b)  Staying of work on premises. An appeal to the special magistrate stays all work on the premises and all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the official from whom the appeal was taken shall certify to the special magistrate, by reason of the facts stated in the certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings or work shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by the special magistrate or a court of competent jurisdiction, on application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. 
(c)  Procedure. Any person appealing any decision of an administrative official shall make such appeal within 30 days after rendition of the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from in writing to the special magistrate and file the appeal, with supporting facts and data with the building and zoning official. This does not, however, restrict the filing of a request for a special exception use or variance by any person at any time except as provided for elsewhere in the city land development regulations. Upon receipt of such appeal, the building and zoning official shall examine such appeal or request application and endorse his recommendation thereon together with all documents, plans, papers or other material constituting the record upon which the action appealed was taken and transmit such record to the special magistrate. 
(d)  Reimbursement of expenses. The applicant shall provide for reimbursement of all expenses incurred by the city, deemed necessary by the city manager or his/her designee, to review and process an administrative appeal. 
    Expenses may include, but are not limited to any technical, engineering, planning, landscaping, surveying, legal or architectural services, and advertising. 
    Within 30 days of the date of receipt of any invoice for such services, the applicant shall reimburse the city for such costs. Failure by the applicant to make such reimbursement when due shall delay the release of a development permit until paid. 
(Ord. No. 1019, § 1, 5-25-04; Ord. No. 1071, § 3(Exh. A, § 2), 2-28-06; Ord. No. 1072, § 2, 3-28-06) 
Sec. 2-506. - Special exception uses. 
(a)  The special magistrate shall hear and decide special exception uses; decide such questions as are involved in determining if special exception uses should be granted; and grant special exception uses with appropriate conditions and safeguards; or to deny special exception uses when not in harmony with the purpose and intent of the city land development regulations. 
(b)  In considering an application for special exception use, the special magistrate shall consider the "specific requirements" as outlined in chapter 110, article IV. 
(c)  In granting any special exception use, the special magistrate shall find that such grant will not adversely affect the public interest. Such decision shall be reached only after receipt of a written report from the local planning agency and the holding of a public hearing. Failure of the local planning agency to submit a written report within 30 days after a referral from the special magistrate shall be deemed as an approval of the application by the local planning agency. In granting any special exception use, the special magistrate, in addition to the standards enumerated in chapter 110, article IV, may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this division. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the special exception use is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Code. The special magistrate may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the special exception use is required shall be begun or completed or both. 
(Ord. No. 1019, § 1, 5-25-04; Ord. No. 1050, § 3, 8-9-05; Ord. No. 1071, § 3(Exh. A, § 2), 2-28-06) 
Sec. 2-507. - Variances. 
(a)  The purpose of a variance is to ensure that no property, because of the special circumstances applicable to it, shall be deprived of privileges commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zone and vicinity. Variances shall be reviewed and may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied by the special magistrate. 
(b)  The special magistrate shall authorize, upon application to appeal, after public notice has been given and public hearing held, such variance from the terms of the city land development regulations as not being contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the land development regulations, subpart B of this Code will result in unnecessary and undue hardship. In order to authorize any variance from the terms of the city land development regulations, the special magistrate shall consider the following criteria and shall find that the criteria has been substantially satisfied and that a hardship exists: 
(1)  Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, building, or other structures for which the variance is sought and which do not apply generally to the lands, building, or other structures in the same district. Special conditions to be considered shall include, but are not limited to, the following circumstances: 
a.  Substandard or irregular-shaped lot. If the site involves the utilization of an existing lot that has unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity of shape, narrowness, shallowness, or the size of the lot is less than the minimum required in the district regulations; 
b.  Significant vegetation or natural features. If the site contains significant native vegetation or other natural features; 
c.  Residential neighborhood character. If the proposed project promotes the established historic or traditional development pattern of a block face, including setbacks, building height, and other dimensional requirements; 
d.  Public facilities. If the proposed project involves the development of public parks, public facilities, schools, or public utilities; 
e.  Architectural and/or engineering considerations. If the proposed project utilizes architectural and/or engineering features that would render the project more disaster resistant. 
(2)  The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant. A self-created hardship shall not justify a variance. 
(3)  Granting the variance will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied to other lands, buildings or structures in the same zoning district. 
(4)  Literal interpretation would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the terms of the land development regulations, subpart B of this Code and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant. 
(5)  The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land. 
(6)  The granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the city land development regulations, and that such variance will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
(c)  In granting any variance, the special magistrate may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the city land development regulations. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted shall be deemed a violation of this Code. The special magistrate may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be begun or completed or both. Under no circumstances except as specified in subsection (a) shall the special magistrate grant a variance to allow a use not generally or by special exception use permitted in the applicable zoning district of the city land development regulations. A nonconforming use of neighborhood lands, structures or buildings in the same zoning district shall not be considered grounds for the authorization of a variance. Financial loss standing alone is not sufficient justification for a variance. 
(Ord. No. 1019, § 1, 5-25-04; Ord. No. 1071, § 3(Exh. A, § 2), 2-28-06; Ord. No. 2012-06, § 1, 9-25-12) 
Sec. 2-508. - Reapplication. 
    An application for the reconsideration or rehearing of an application which has been previously acted upon by the special magistrate may be made in the same manner as provided for at original consideration or hearing. However, no appeal or petition by applicant requesting the same relief or approval for the same property shall without a substantial change as determined by the special magistrate, be accepted for reconsideration or rehearing for a period of three months following the date of any action taken by the special magistrate. 
(Ord. No. 1019, § 1, 5-25-04; Ord. No. 1071, § 3(Exh. A, § 2), 2-28-06) 
Sec. 2-509. - Appeals. 
    An aggrieved party, including the local governing authority, may appeal a final administrative order of the special magistrate to the circuit court. Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo, but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before the special magistrate. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the execution of the order to be appealed. 
(Ord. No. 1019, § 1, 5-25-04; Ord. No. 1071, § 3(Exh. A, § 2), 2-28-06) 
Sec. 2-510. - Conflict of interest provisions. 
(a)  No person who is or may become a party or a witness to a hearing before the special magistrate shall communicate with him concerning variances or special exception uses except at the hearings provided for in this division. This restriction shall extend to any person appearing or interceding on behalf of a party, whether or not such person may have a direct, personal or financial interest in the property which is the subject of the alleged violation. 
(b)  The special magistrate shall not communicate with any party, witness, representative of a party, or interceding person concerning any variance or special exception use except at the hearings provided for in this division. 
(c)  Failure on the part of the special magistrate to comply with the provisions of this section may constitute grounds for his removal.

f.  The presiding chairperson shall control the conduct of the review and shall limit statements and questions to the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident upon which the declaration of viciousness is based. Further, the presiding chairperson shall prevent testimony based upon hearsay or any grounds other than direct knowledge or observation. 
(c)  Subsequent violation by animal declared to be vicious. 
(1)  Upon the written, sworn complaint of any person averring that an animal previously declared vicious has actually bitten or attacked any person or animal while in violation of the provisions of the declaration of viciousness, the city manager or his designee shall investigate the incident, and if he determines that the complaint is true, he shall impound the animal immediately. The animal may be impounded from the owner's property, and such impoundment may be made with or without the consent of the owner. 
(2)  The city manager shall thereafter give notice to the owner or keeper of the animal by personal service or by certified mail return receipt requested, advising of the animal's impoundment. The notice shall advise the owner or keeper that he has 20 days from the day of service or 30 days from the date of impoundment, whichever is greater, within which to remove the animal permanently from the boundaries of the city or to appeal the decision of the city manager and the act of impoundment to a court of competent jurisdiction. The city manager shall make reasonable effort to notify the animal's owner or keeper of the impoundment by telephone. If the animal is not removed from the city or a proper appeal of the impoundment is not filed in an appropriate court of law within the time period specified, the animal shall henceforth be destroyed in a humane manner. 
(d)  Failure to keep animal out of city. 
(1)  Any animal declared to be vicious and released to its owner or keeper for permanent removal from the city pursuant to the subsection (c) of this section, if found thereafter within the city limits, shall be seized immediately and destroyed.

Provided, however, the granting or denying of consent as set forth shall be within the sole discretion of the board of commissioners; and providing further, the granting of such authority on one occasion shall not be a precedent for the granting of such authority at a different time even if the facts and circumstances shall be the same or similar.

Except when the pavement is to be replaced before the opening of the cut to traffic, the fill above the bottom of the paving slab shall be made with suitable material well tamped into place and this fill shall be topped with a minimum of at least one inch of bituminous mixture which is suitable to maintain the opening in good condition until permanent restoration can be made. The crown of the temporary restoration shall exercise special care in making such temporary restorations and must maintain such restorations in safe traveling condition until such time as permanent restorations are made. The asphalt which is used shall be in accordance with the specifications of the city manager. If in the judgement of the city manager it is not expedient to replace the pavement over any cut or excavation made in the street upon completion of work allowed under such permit by reason of the looseness of the earth or weather conditions, he may direct the permittee to lay a temporary pavement of wood or other suitable material designated by him over such cut or excavation to remain until such time as the repair of the original pavement may be properly made. 
(c)  Permanent restoration. Permanent restoration of the street shall be made by the permittee in strict accordance with section 58-74.

Sec. 58-131. - Title. 
    This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the City of Madeira Beach Communications Rights-of-Way Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 949, § 1, 8-7-01) 
Sec. 58-132. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is the intent of the city to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by: providing for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way within the city; adopting and administering reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with state and federal law, including F.S. § 337.401 (2000), as it may be amended, the city's home-rule authority, and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other federal and state law; establishing reasonable rules and regulations necessary to manage the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way by all communications services providers; and minimizing disruption to the public rights-of-way. In regulating its public rights-of-way, the city shall be governed by and shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws. 
(Ord. No. 949, § 1, 8-7-01) 
Sec. 58-133. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this article, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meanings given. Where not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future tense, words in the plural number include the singular number, and words in the singular number include the plural number. The words "shall" and "will" are mandatory, and "may" is permissive. Words not otherwise defined shall be construed to mean the common and ordinary meaning. 
    Abandonment shall mean the permanent cessation of all uses of a communications facility; provided that this term shall not include cessation of all use of a facility within a physical structure where the physical structure continues to be used. By way of example, and not limitation, cessation of all use of a cable within a conduit, where the conduit continues to be used, shall not be "abandonment" of a facility in public rights-of-way. 
    City shall mean the City of Madeira Beach, Florida. 
    Communications services shall mean the transmission, conveyance or routing of voice, data, audio, video, or any other information or signals to a point, or between or among points, by or through any electronic, radio, satellite, cable, optical, microwave, or other medium or method now in existence or hereafter devised, regardless of the protocol used for such transmission or conveyance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this article "cable service", as defined in F.S. § 202.11(2) (2000), as it may be amended, is not included in the definition of "communications services," and cable service providers may be subject to other ordinances of the city. 
    Communications service provider shall mean any person including a municipality or county providing communications services through the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in a public rights-of-way. "Communications service provider" shall also include any person including a municipality or county that places or maintains a communications facility in public rights-of-way but does not provide communications services. 
    Communications facility or facility or system shall mean any permanent or temporary plant, equipment and property, including but not limited to cables, wires, conduits, ducts, fiber optics, poles, antennae, converters, splice boxes, cabinets, hand holes, manholes, vaults, drains, surface location markers, appurtenances, and other equipment or pathway placed or maintained or to be placed or maintained in the public rights-of-way of the city and used or capable of being used to transmit, convey, route, receive, distribute, provide or offer communications services. 
    FCC shall mean the Federal Communications Commission. 
    In public rights-of-way or in the public rights-of-way shall mean in, on, over, under or across the public rights-of-way. 
    Ordinance shall mean this article. 
    Person shall include any individual, children, firm, association, joint venture, partnership, estate, trust, business trust, syndicate, fiduciary, corporation, organization or legal entity of any kind, successor, assignee, transferee, personal representative, and all other groups or combinations, and shall include the all city, county, state or other public entities to the extent the said public entities act as a communications services provider. 
    Person shall include any individual, children, firm, association, joint venture, partnership, estate, trust, business trust, syndicate, fiduciary, corporation, organization or legal entity of any kind, successor, assignee, transferee, personal representative, and all other groups or combinations, and shall include the all city, county, state or other public entities to the extent the said public entities act as a communications service provider. 
    Place or maintain or placement or maintenance or placing or maintaining shall mean to erect, construct, install, maintain, place, repair, extend, expand, remove, occupy, locate or relocate. A communications service provider that owns or exercises physical control over communications facilities in public rights-of-way, such as the physical control to maintain and repair, is "placing or maintaining" the facilities. A person providing service only through resale or only through use of a third party's unbundled network elements is not "placing or maintaining" the communications facilities through which such service is provided. The transmission and receipt of radio frequency signals through the airspace of the public rights-of-way does not constitute "placing or maintaining" facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
    Public rights-of-way shall mean a public right-of-way, public utility easement, highway, street, bridge, tunnel or alley for which the city is the authority that has jurisdiction and control and may lawfully grant access to pursuant to applicable law, and includes the surface, the air space over the surface and the area below the surface. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include private property. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include any real or personal city property except as described above and shall not include city buildings, fixtures, poles, conduits, facilities or other structures or improvements, regardless of whether they are situated in the public rights-of-way. 
    Registrant shall mean a communications services provider that has registered with the city in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
    Registration or register shall mean the process described in this article whereby a communications services provider provides certain information to the city. 
(Ord. No. 949, § 1, 8-7-01) 
Sec. 58-134. - Registration for placing or maintaining communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(a)  A communications service provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall first register with the city in accordance with this article. Subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in this article, a registrant may place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(b)  A registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the public rights-of-way. Registration under this article governs only the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way. Other ordinances, codes or regulations may apply to the placement or maintenance in the public rights-of-way of facilities that are not communications facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications service provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the city or another person's facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications service provider from complying with all applicable city ordinances, code or regulations, including this article. 
(c)  Each communications service provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall file a single registration with the city which shall include the following information: 
(1)  Name of the applicant; 
(2)  Name, address and telephone number of the applicant's primary contact person in connection with the registration, and the person to contact in case of an emergency; 
(3)  For registrations submitted prior to October 1, 2001, the applicant shall state whether it provides local service or toll service or both; 
(4)  Evidence of the insurance coverage required under this article and acknowledgment that registrant has received and reviewed a copy of this article, which acknowledgment shall not be deemed an agreement; and 
(5)  The number of the applicant's certificate of authorization or license to provide communications services issued by the Florida Public Service Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or other federal or state authority, if any. 
    For an applicant that does not provide a Florida Public Service Commission certificate of authorization number, if the applicant is a corporation, proof of authority to do business in the State of Florida, such as the number of the certificate from or filing with the Florida Department of State. 
(d)  The city shall review the information submitted by the applicant. Such review shall be by the city manager or his designee. If the applicant submits information in accordance with subsection (c) above, the registration shall be effective and the city manager or his designee shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the city determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with subsection (c) above, the city shall notify the applicant of the non-effectiveness of registration, and reasons for the non-effectiveness, in writing. The city shall so reply to an applicant within 30 days after receipt of registration information from the applicant. Non-effectiveness of Registration shall not preclude an applicant from filing subsequent applications for registration under the provisions of this section. 
(e)  A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the city and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(f)  Registration does not in and of itself establish a right to place or maintain or priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the city but shall establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by the city. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this article and further subject to any additional city ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted. 
(g)  A registrant shall renew its registration with the city by April 1 of even numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this article, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even numbered year. Within 30 days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection 3, except, as of October 1, 2001, subsection (c)(3), a Registrant shall provide updated information to the city. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services provider has complied with the registration requirements of this article. 
(h)  A communications services provider that has registered with the city, pursuant to section 58-134 that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way must obtain a permit. An effective registration shall be a condition of obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall apply. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met. 
(Ord. No. 949, § 1, 8-7-01) 
Sec. 58-135. - Notice of transfer, sale or assignment of assets in public rights-of-way. 
    If a registrant transfers, sells or assigns its assets located in public rights-of-way incident to a transfer, sale or assignment of the registrant's assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to comply with the terms of this article. Written notice of any such transfer, sale or assignment shall be provided by such registrant to the city within 20 days after the effective date of the transfer, sale or assignment. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee is not required to re-register. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is not a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee shall register as provided in section 58-134 within 60 days of the transfer, sale or assignment. If permit applications are pending in the registrant's name, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall notify the city manager or his designee that the transferee, buyer or assignee is the new applicant. 
(Ord. No. 949, § 1, 8-7-01) 
Sec. 58-136. - Placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(a)  A registrant shall at all times comply with and abide by all applicable provisions of the state and federal law and city ordinances, codes and regulations in placing or maintaining a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(b)  A registrant shall not commence to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way until all applicable permits, if any, have been issued by the city or other appropriate authority, except in the case of an emergency. The term "emergency" shall mean a condition that affects the public's health, safety or welfare, which includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of a pre-existing service. Registrant shall provide prompt notice to the city of the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the event of an emergency and shall obtain an after-the-fact permit if a permit would have originally been required to perform the work undertaken in public rights-of-way in connection with the emergency. Registrant acknowledges that as a condition of granting such permits, the city may impose reasonable rules or regulations governing the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. Permits shall apply only to the areas of public rights-of-way specifically identified in the permit. The city may issue a blanket permit to cover certain activities, such as routine maintenance and repair activities that may otherwise require individual permits. 
(c)  The communications service provider wishing to obtain a permit shall submit an application for permit containing the following: 
(1)  Plans showing the location of the proposed facilities, including a description of the facilities to be installed, where the facilities are to be located, and the approximate size of facilities that will be located in public rights-of-way; 
(2)  A description of the manner in which the facility will be installed (i.e. anticipated construction methods or techniques); 
(3)  A maintenance of traffic plan for any disruption of the public rights-of-way; 
(4)  Information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed facility, if available (such information shall be provided without certification as to correctness, to the extent obtained from other persons); 
(5)  If appropriate given the facility proposed, an estimate of the cost of restoration to the public rights-of-way; 
(6)  The timetable for construction of the project or each phase thereof, and the areas of the city which will be affected; and 
(7)  Such additional information as the city finds reasonably necessary with respect to the placement or maintenance of the communications facility that is the subject of the permit application to review such permit application. 
(d)  To the extent not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within a particular area of public rights-of-way. 
(e)  All communications facilities shall be placed or maintained so as not to unreasonably interfere with the use of the public rights-of-way by the public and with the rights and convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the public rights-of-way. The use of trenchless technology (i.e., directional bore method) for the installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way as well as joint trenching or the co-location of facilities in existing conduit is strongly encouraged, and should be employed wherever feasible. The community services director or city engineer may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations concerning the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way consistent with this article and other applicable law. 
(f)  All safety practices required by applicable law or accepted industry practices and standards shall be used during the placement or maintenance of communications facilities. 
(g)  After the completion of any placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way or each phase thereof, a registrant shall, at its own expense, restore the public rights-of-way to its original condition before such work. If the registrant fails to make such restoration within 30 days, or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required under the circumstances, following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the city may perform restoration and charge the costs of the restoration against the registrant in accordance with F.S. § 337.402 (2000), as it may be amended. For 12 months following the original completion of the work, the registrant shall guarantee its restoration work and shall correct any restoration work that does not satisfy the requirements of this article at its own expense. 
(h)  Removal or relocation at the direction of the city of a registrant's communications facility in public rights-of-way shall be governed by the provisions of F.S. §§ 337.403 and 337.404 (2000), as they may be amended. 
(i)  A permit from the city constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities in public rights-of-way in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. 
(j)  A registrant shall maintain its communications facility in public rights-of-way in a manner consistent with accepted industry practice and applicable law. 
(k)  In connection with excavation in the public rights-of-way, a registrant shall, where applicable, comply with the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act set forth in F.S. ch. 556 (2000), as it may be amended. 
(l)  Registrant shall use and exercise due caution, care and skill in performing work in the public rights-of-way and shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard work site areas. 
(m)  Upon request of the city, and as notified by the city of the other work, construction, installation or repairs referenced below, a registrant may be required to coordinate placement or maintenance activities under a permit with any other work, construction, installation or repairs that may be occurring or scheduled to occur within a reasonable timeframe in the subject public rights-of-way, and registrant may be required to reasonably alter its placement or maintenance schedule as necessary so as to minimize disruptions and disturbance in the public rights-of-way. 
(n)  A registrant shall not place or maintain its communications facilities so as to interfere with, displace, damage or destroy any facilities, including but not limited to, sewers, gas or water mains, storm drains, pipes, cables or conduits of the city, Pinellas County or any other person's facilities lawfully occupying the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(o)  The city makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or availability of city's public rights-of-way for the registrant's communications facilities and any performance of work, costs incurred or services provided by registrant shall be at registrant's sole risk. Nothing in this article shall affect the city's authority to add, vacate or abandon public rights-of-way, and city makes no warranties or representations regarding the availability of any added, vacated or abandoned public rights-of-way for communications facilities. 
(p)  The city shall have the right to make such inspections of communications facilities placed or maintained in public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(q)  A permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way shall include plans showing the location of the proposed installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way. If the plans so provided require revision based upon actual installation, the registrant shall promptly provide revised plans. The plans shall be in a hard copy format or an electronic format specified by the city, provided such electronic format is maintained by the registrant. Such plans in a format maintained by the Registrant shall be provided at no cost to the city. 
(r)  The city reserves the right to place and maintain, and permit to be placed or maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and other types of facilities, cables or conduit, and to do, and to permit to be done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may be deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way occupied by the registrant. The city further reserves without limitation the right to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation, or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the city and within said limits as same may from time to time be altered. 
(s)  A registrant shall, on the request of any person holding a permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its communications facilities to permit the work authorized by the permit. The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of facilities shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the registrant shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The registrant shall be given not less than 30 days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary relocation. 
Wireless facility: 
    A wireless facility that is a portion of a communication facility, such as an antenna ("wireless facility(ies)"), which is attached to a legally maintained vertical structure in the public rights-of-way, such as a light pole or utility pole ("vertical structure(s)"), shall be subject to the following criteria: 
(1)  Such wireless facilities may not extend more than 20 feet above the highest point of the vertical structure; 
(2)  Such wireless facilities that are attached to a vertical structure located in public rights-of-way that is five feet or less in width and is located adjacent to real property used as a single family residence shall be flush mounted to the vertical structure;

(7)  Any accessory equipment and related housing in the public rights-of-way that are used in conjunction with such a wireless facility shall comply with any applicable local rules, regulations, ordinances, or laws governing the placement and design of such equipment. 
    Vertical structures, such as towers, whose sole purpose is to serve as a mounting device for antennae, are expressly prohibited from being placed in the public rights-of-way unless applicable zoning and land use laws or regulations allow such structures to be placed within the zoning district in which such public rights-of-way are located or to which they are adjacent. 
(Ord. No. 949, § 1, 8-7-01) 
Sec. 58-137. - Suspension of permits.

In the event of (2), the city may require the third person to coordinate with the registrant that owns the existing facility for joint removal and placement, where agreed to by the registrant.

(2)  Reasonable accommodation. The city manager or designee may also grant an administrative waiver to the site planning or development standards of the LDR in compliance with this section, based on the finding that the waiver is necessary to accomplish a reasonable accommodation of the needs of a disabled person, in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

(Code 1983, § 20-901) 
Sec. 90-2. - Definitions. 
    Development order means any order granting, denying, or granting with conditions, an application for development. 
    Deficient facility means a road operating at peak hour level of service E or F, and/or a volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio of 0.9 or higher with no mitigating improvements scheduled within three years. 
    Land Development Regulatory System means the coordinated system of plans (e.g., comprehensive plans), regulations, code provisions and related status reports (e.g., concurrency test statement and transportation system report) that provide standards and guidance for land development related activities. 
    Mobility plan means the framework providing for a countywide approach to managing the traffic impacts of development projects and to increasing mobility for pedestrians, bicyclists, transit users and motor vehicles through the implementation of the Multimodal Impact Fee Ordinance and the transportation provisions of this section through the site plan review process. 
    New peak hour trip refers to a vehicle trip added to the major road network from and to a developed parcel of land during the weekday peak hour. This excludes "passer-by" or "diverted" trips, whereby the site is accessed as a secondary trip. 
    Peak hour, in describing traffic conditions, means the 100th highest volume hour of the year in the predominant traffic flow direction. 
    Public schools interlocal agreement means the interlocal agreement executed by the city on November 6, 2012 between the Pinellas County School Board, Pinellas County, and the 12 municipalities within Pinellas County. 
    Pre-existing use refers to the land use that occupied a parcel of land prior to the submittal of a permit/site plan application. In accordance with the Pinellas County Transportation Impact Fee Ordinance (TIFO), development projects are entitled to a credit equivalent to the impact fee assessment of any land use activity that existed on the property as of June 30, 1986, the original adoption date of the TIFO. The applicant must provide the necessary documentation to verify any pre-existing use activity not reflected in the current records of the Pinellas County Property Appraiser's Office. 
    Renovations, as defined in the Florida Building Code, Chapter 4, Section 423.5., means the rejuvenating or upgrading of existing facilities by installation or replacement of materials and equipment. The use and occupancy of the spaces remain the same. 
    Residential approval means a residential site plan approval or a final residential subdivision approval. 
    School district means the unit for the control, organization, and administration of schools in Pinellas County. The responsibility for the actual operation and administration of all schools needed within the district in conformity with rules and minimum standards prescribed by the state, and also the responsibility for the provision of any desirable and practicable opportunities authorized by law beyond those required by the state, are delegated by law to the school officials of the Pinellas County School District. 
    Transportation management plan, as developed by an applicant representing a proposed development, is submitted in conjunction with individual site plans seeking to utilize transportation management strategies to address their development impacts, protect roadway capacity and to increase mobility. These strategies include, but are not limited to, density/intensity reductions, project phasing, access controls, capital improvements and/or incentives encouraging mass transit, bicycle or pedestrian travel, ride-sharing or roadway improvements. Strategies that are standard site plan review requirements would not be eligible for inclusion in a transportation management plan. Transportation Management Plans must be submitted to the planning department for review and approval. 
    Transportation management system refers to the management of development impacts on transportation facilities and implementation of mobility improvements pursuant to the mobility plan. (Note: This is intended to replace references to concurrency management system pertaining to transportation).

Sec. 90-10. - Transportation management plan. 
(a)  Transportation management plans are to be submitted by applicants of development projects in conjunction with their site plans. Transportation management plans are required for development applications seeking to utilize transportation management strategies/improvements to address their development impacts. The extent of the strategies/improvements included in an approved transportation management plan in terms of the scale of the project(s) and roadway capacity and/or mobility benefits provided shall be based primarily on the projected impact of the development project on the surrounding traffic circulation system. Specific conditions of the deficient road corridor impacted by the development will also be considered. Transportation management plan strategies/improvements applicable to development projects within deficient road corridors will be determined at the time of site plan review. Should the impacts of the development project impact a road under the jurisdiction of an adjacent local government or FDOT, the identification of appropriate TMP strategies shall be coordinated with the affected jurisdiction(s). Transportation management plans must be developed by the applicant and accepted by the [local government]. Transportation management plan strategies/improvements include, but are not limited to those listed below. 
(1)  Intensity reduction. The intensity of the proposal may be reduced through an across-the-board reduction of the permitted floor area ratio, as it would otherwise normally apply to the proposal. Other such corrective actions that would reduce the intensity of the proposal may also apply. 
(2)  Density reduction. The density of the proposal may be decreased by a reduction in the number of units per acre below that which would otherwise normally apply to the proposal. 
(3)  Project phasing. A project may be divided into logical phases of development by area, with later phases of the development proposal's approval withheld until the needed facilities are available. 
(4)  Outparcel deletion. Those portions of the proposal characterized as outparcels that create separate and unique impacts may be deleted from the total proposal. 
(5)  Physical highway improvements. A project may construct link capacity improvements, acceleration/deceleration lanes, intersection improvements or frontage roads. 
(6)  Operational improvements (signal). This includes efforts involving signal removal or signal timing improvements. 
(7)  Access management strategies. These include access management controls such as the preclusion of a direct connection to a deficient facility, right-in/right-out driveways, alternative driveway locations, reduction of a driveway, single point access, shared access or the implementation of median controls. 
(8)  Mass transit initiatives. A project may implement a plan to encourage transit (e.g., employer-issued bus passes). Other mass transit initiatives may include, but are not limited to, direct route subsidies, provision of feeder service or the construction of bus stop amenities, bus pull-off areas and dedication of park and ride parking spaces. 
(9)  Demand management/commuter assistance. These include efforts to encourage ride-sharing (e.g., designated parking spaces for carpools, employer-sponsored carpool program, participation in transportation management organization/initiative programs), and to implement flexible work hour and telecommuting programs. 
(10)  Bicycle/pedestrian improvements. These would involve structural improvements or construction of a bikeway or sidewalk connecting an existing bikeway/sidewalk network or providing access to a school, park, shopping center, etc. These improvements may also include pedestrian treatments in parking areas, sidewalks connecting developments with adjacent land uses, trail improvements and bicycle rack and on-street bicycle lane installations, and the planting of trees to provide shade canopy along sidewalks. 
(11)  Intelligent transportation system improvements. This includes improvements pertaining to computerized traffic signal systems that automatically adjust to maximize traffic flow and to permit emergency vehicles to pass through intersections quickly. It also includes freeway management systems, such as electronic message signs, and electronic fare payment on public buses that reduce passenger boarding time. 
(12)  Livable community site design features. These include, but are not limited to, implementation of pedestrian friendly site design features such as orienting buildings toward the street and parking lots to the side or rear of buildings. 
(b)  Transportation management plans seeking to implement strategies that do not involve structural improvements, such as ride-sharing and transit incentive programs, must include a monitoring program to ensure the strategies are carried out in accordance with the plan, as developed by the applicant and accepted by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2016-07, § 9, 10-11-16) 
Editor's note- See Editor's Note § 90-9. 
Sec. 90-11. - Deficient road corridors, transportation management plan strategies applied. 
(a)  Deficient road corridors include parcels within one-half mile of the centerline or terminus of a facility operating under a deficient level of service. 
(b)  In support of the provisions of this section regarding deficient road corridors, policies in the comprehensive plan seek to discourage future land use map (FLUM) amendments that allow for an increase in automobile trips generated from sites proposed for amendment. 
It is recognized that exceptions to this provision may apply within road corridors where the local government comprehensive plan is seeking increased densities and intensities for planning purposes. 
(c)  Development projects located within deficient road corridors that generate between 51 and 300 new peak hour trips are classified as tier 1. 
(1)  Developers of tier 1 projects are required to submit a transportation management plan designed to address their impacts while increasing mobility and reducing the demand for single occupant vehicle travel. 
(2)  The cost of transportation management strategies implemented for tier 1 projects are creditable toward their multimodal impact fee assessment in accordance with the Multimodal Impact Fee Ordinance. If the cost of the improvement exceeds the assessment, the development project would not be subject to payment of the fee. 
(d)  Development projects located within deficient road corridors that generate more than 300 new peak hour trips are classified as tier 2. Developers of tier 2 projects are required to conduct a traffic study and submit an accompanying report. The report shall include the results of the traffic study and a transportation management plan identifying improvements necessary to mitigate the impacts of the project. The report shall be submitted to the planning department for review. The cost of transportation management strategies implemented for tier 2 projects may be applied as credit toward the project's multimodal impact fee assessment in accordance with the Multimodal Impact Fee Ordinance or payment of the fee could be included as part of a transportation management plan. 
(e)  Development projects that generate less than 51 new peak hour trips are required to pay a multimodal impact fee in accordance with the Multimodal Impact Fee Ordinance. They are not required to submit a transportation management plan or traffic study. A traffic study and corresponding transportation management plan for a land development project generating more than 50 new peak hour trips outside a deficient road corridor may be required if through the site plan review process the local government determines that operational improvements such as intersection or median modifications are necessary to accommodate the additional trips generated by the proposed land use. 
(Ord. No. 2016-07, § 10, 10-11-16) 
Sec. 90-12. - Methodology applied 
    Determination of trip generation shall be based on the Pinellas County Transportation Impact Fee Ordinance fee schedules and latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual.

(2)  Determination by the Special Magistrate that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and chapters; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

The drainage plan shall include an up-to-date survey of the proposed land to be developed, redeveloped or graded and land balanced showing the number and location of existing trees, adequate elevations or contours to determine the existing and proposed drainage patterns, and all ditches, canals, streams, storm sewers, and all other key topographic features located within or directly adjacent to or serving the land to be developed or cleared. The calculations for runoff, detention and pipe sizes shall also be included. The city may require such additional information as may be deemed necessary to determine whether the plan meets the requirements of this article. The drainage plan shall also contain the following: 
(1)  The name, address, and telephone number of the owner and the developer, and the legal description of the property. 
(2)  A plan for the control of erosion and sedimentation which specifies in detail the type and location of control measures, the stage of development at which they will be put into place or used, and provisions for the maintenance thereof. 
(Code 1983, § 20-509(C)) 
Sec. 98-34. - Exemptions. 
    The following shall be exempt from the requirements of this article. 
(1)  Single-family homes, duplexes and triplexes. The owner of an individual single-family home, duplex or triplex is exempted from the requirements of this article, except that: 
a.  The placement, installation or construction of impervious surfaces shall not exceed 60 percent of the lot and/or parcel area; and 
b.  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged, any increase in stormwater, surface water or roof runoff to the detriment of adjacent property owners. 
(2)  Minor additions, alterations or improvements to existing development. Minor additions and alterations to an existing development are exempted from the requirements of this article. For the purpose of this exemption, a minor addition, alteration, or improvement is defined as additions which do not increase existing gross floor area by more than five percent or vehicular use areas by more than ten percent, or alterations and repairs, the aggregate cost of which does not exceed 25 percent of the fair market value is determined: 
a.  Immediately before the first improvement is started; or 
b.  Immediately before any damage resulting from fire or casualty. 
(Code 1983, § 20-509(D); Ord. No. 961, § 1, 7-23-02) 
Sec. 98-35. - Certificate of compliance required. 
(a)  Upon completion of improvements and request of the owner or developer, the city shall inspect the site for compliance with the approved plan. If the property is found to be in compliance with the approved plan, a certificate of compliance shall be issued. 
(b)  No certificate of occupancy for any related structure may be issued and no paved access (curb cuts) to public streets from the site may be granted until the certificate of compliance is issued. 
(Code 1983, § 20-509(E)) 
Sec. 98-36. - Control requirements for stormwater runoff. 
    Drainage plans shall be approved only if they establish that the proposed development or grading and land balancing comply with the following standards: 
(1)  No development or grading and land balancing subject to this article, shall be allowed to discharge more stormwater onto adjacent right-of-way or property than is discharged from the site in its natural unimproved state. 
(2)  No proposed development or grading and land balancing shall cause erosion or flooding of adjacent areas during or after construction. 
(3)  Runoff should not be discharged directly into open waters. Instead, vegetated buffers, swales, vegetated watercourses, wetlands, underground drains, catch basins, ponds, porous pavements and similar systems for the detention, retention, treatment and percolation of runoff should be used as appropriate to increase time of concentration, decrease velocity, increase infiltration, allow suspended solids to settle and remove pollutants. 
(4)  The first one inch of runoff from impervious surfaces should be retained on the site of development. 
(5)  Runoff from parking lots should be treated to remove oil and sediment before it enters receiving waters. 
(6)  Erosion should be minimized and sediment should be retained on the site of development. 
(7)  The area of land disturbed by development should be the minimum feasible. Those areas which are not to be disturbed should be protected from construction activity by an adequate barrier. Wherever possible, natural vegetation shall be retained and protected. 
(8)  Natural watercourses should not be filled, dredged, cleared, deepened, widened, straightened, stabilized or otherwise altered. 
(9)  Intermittent watercourses, such as swales must be vegetated. 
(10)  Artificial watercourses should be designed, considering the soil type, so the velocity of flow is low enough to prevent erosion. 
(11)  Detention and retention areas should be designed so shorelines are sinuous rather than straight and so the length of shoreline is maximized, thus offering more space for the growth of littoral (shoreline) vegetation. 
(12)  The banks of detention and retention areas should slope at a gentle grade into the water as a safeguard against personal injury, to encourage the growth of littoral vegetation and to allow the alternate flooding and exposure of areas along the shore. 
(13)  Wetlands should not be altered, relocated, damaged or used as detention ponds. 
(14)  Excavation activities shall not adversely impact the quality of groundwater on surrounding property. 
(15)  Vegetated buffer strips should be created or, where feasible, retained in their natural state along the banks of all watercourses, water bodies or wetlands. The width of the buffer should be sufficient to prevent erosion, trap the sediment in overland runoff, provide access to the water body and allow for periodic flooding without damage to buildings, roads or other structures. 
(16)  Erosion and sedimentation control devices should be installed between the disturbed area and water bodies, watercourses and wetlands before grading, cutting or filling is begun. 
(17)  Land which has been cleared for development and upon which construction has commenced should be protected from erosion by appropriate techniques designed to stabilize soil and revegetate the area. Adequate protective measures include hay bales, baffles, sodding and sandbagging. 
(18)  Wetlands and other natural water bodies should not be used as sediment traps during development. 
(19)  Upon completion of land alteration activities, exposed soils shall be vegetated. Areas may be sodded, plugged, sprigged or seeded or covered with other vegetation as desired. In areas where erosion is likely, such as slopes greater than five to one or areas of erosion-prone soils, the city may determine that sodding is required. 
(20)  Erosion and sedimentation facilities should receive regular maintenance to ensure proper functioning. 
(Code 1983, § 20-509(F)) 
Sec. 98-37. - Protection of environmentally sensitive areas. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to provide a buffer adjacent to wetlands to further protect water quality and quantity and associated wildlife from adjacent development impacts. Such impacts include siltration, eutrophication, noise, artificial light and human and domestic animal intrusion. These buffers will also provide preservation of upland wildlife habitat. 
(b)  Upland setback requirements. Upland setback requirements shall be as follows: 
(1)  Setbacks required from wetlands are as follows: 
a.  Isolated wetlands. Creeks, channels, ditches, canals and other waterways which are not designated as preservation land use areas and are connected with waters of the state as defined in the Florida Administrative Code: 15 feet outside the top of a bank of contiguous wetlands, whichever is greater. 
b.  All other wetlands: 30 feet. 
(2)  No environmental setback shall be required landward of a seawall constructed on or prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
(3)  The setbacks must be shown on a site plan and must be preserved during site development. 
(4)  Removal of vegetation within the required setback is discouraged and may be restricted or prohibited by the city to protect water quality. 
(5)  No filling, excavating or placing of permanent structures or other impervious surfaces shall be allowed within a required setback.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 102-1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose and intent of this chapter is to establish a set of standards for the structural design, fabrication and erection, use, maintenance, and alteration of signs, symbols, markings or advertising devices within the city. The standards of this chapter are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of persons within the city by providing regulations which allow and encourage creativity, effectiveness, and flexibility in the design and use of such devices while promoting traffic safety and avoiding an environment that encourages visual blight. The sign regulations in this section are not intended to censor speech or to regulate viewpoints, but instead are intended to regulate the secondary effects of speech and especially insofar as those secondary effects may adversely affect aesthetics and traffic and pedestrian safety, and to accomplish the following: 
    Encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communications in the city: 
(1)  Maintain and enhance the visual and aesthetic environment and thereby the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth, including enhancing the tourism industry; 
(2)  Foster the integration of signage with architectural and landscape designs; 
(3)  Preserve, conserve, protect, and enhance the aesthetic quality, historic resources, and scenic beauty of the city; 
(4)  Lessen the visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation, excessive height, and excessive size (area) of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic; 
(5)  Minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; 
(6)  Regulate the appearance and design of signs in a manner that promotes and enhances the beautification of the city and that compliments the natural surroundings in recognition of this city's reliance on its natural surroundings and beautification efforts in retaining economic advantage for its resort community, as well as, for its major office and industrial parks, gateways, downtown and waterfront areas, and overlay districts; 
(7)  Allow signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation, while precluding the placement of signs that contribute to sign clutter or that conceal or obstruct adjacent land uses or signs; 
(8)  Improve pedestrian and traffic safety; 
(9)  Regulate signs in a manner so as to not interfere with, obstruct the vision of or distract motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians; 
(10)  Except to the extent expressly preempted by state or federal law, ensure that signs are constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner, and protect the public from unsafe signs; 
(11)  Encourage and allow signs that are appropriate to the land use atlas district in which they are located and consistent with the category of use and function to which they pertain; 
(12)  Curtail the size and number of signs to the minimum reasonably necessary to identify a residential or business location and the nature of any such business; 
(13)  Establish sign size in relationship to the scale of the lot and building on which the sign is to be placed or to which it pertains; 
(14)  Preclude signs from conflicting with the principal permitted use of the site and adjoining signs; 
(15)  Allow for traffic control devices consistent with national standards and whose purpose is to promote highway safety and efficiency by providing for the orderly movement of road users on streets and highways, and that notify road users of regulations and provide warning and guidance needed for the safe, uniform and efficient operation of all elements of the traffic stream; 
(16)  Protect property values by precluding to the maximum extent possible sign types that create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other properties as a result of their size, height, illumination, brightness, or movement; 
(17)  Protect property values by ensuring that sign types as well as the number of signs, are in harmony with buildings, neighborhoods, and conforming signs in the area; 
(18)  Streamline the approval process by requiring master signage plans; and 
(19)  Enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations.

ARTICLE III. - NONCONFORMANCES 

Sec. 110-91. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  It is the intent of this article to provide for the continuance of lawful nonconformities, without unduly restricting the owners ability to maintain or improve their property, but to restrict further investment which would make the nonconformity more permanent. This article is intended to permit lawful nonconforming uses and structures created by the adoption of this Code to continue, until removed by economic or other forces. This article is intended to discourage the continuation of nonconformities as they are incompatible with the provisions of the city comprehensive plan and this Code. 
(b)  All rights and obligations associated with a nonconforming status run with the property, are not personal to the present ownership or tenant, and are not effected by a change of ownership or tenancy, unless abandoned. 
(Code 1983, § 20-611(A)) 
Sec. 110-92. - Classification. 
(a)  Nonconformities are classified as follows: 
(1)  Lots. 
(2)  Uses of land and structures. 
(3)  Structures. 
(4)  Characteristics of use. 
(b)  A nonconformity may also be created where lawful public taking or actions pursuant to a court order create violations of the land development regulations. 
(Code 1983, § 20-611(B)) 
Sec. 110-93. - Intent concerning nonconforming property, structures and uses. 
    It is the intent of the land development regulations that these nonconformities shall be considered to be incompatible with the permitted uses within the city districts. Such nonconformities shall not be enlarged or extended in any respect. 
(1)  Nonconforming lots. 
a.  Use of single, nonconforming lots for residential districts. Notwithstanding the maximum density requirements of the comprehensive plan, in residential districts, the single-family and customary accessory structures may be erected, reconstructed, occupied and used on separate nonconforming lots of record which are not in continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership in accord with other requirements applying in the separate districts. 
b.  Use of single, nonconforming lots for nonresidential uses. In other than residential districts, a nonconforming lot of record which is not in continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership, may accommodate uses permitted within that district in accordance with other requirements applying in that district. 
c.  Rules concerning combination of contiguous nonconforming lots in same ownership and with continuous frontage. 
1.  Where nonconforming status was created at enactment or amendment of this Code or of the comprehensive plan. Where more than one nonconforming lot of record in single ownership and with continuous frontage exists, they shall be combined and considered a single zoning lot. The zoning administrator shall authorize their use only when the lot area and lot width requirements for the district in which the lots are located are satisfied. Full setback requirements shall apply to all of the newly created lots. 
2.  Combination not required where nonconformity created by public taking or court order. Where the nonconforming lots were created by public taking action or as a result of a court order, a combining of the individual lots shall not be required. 
(2)  Nonconforming uses. Nonconforming uses of land shall be brought into conformance as soon as reasonably possible, but may continue provided: 
a.  There shall be no replacement, enlargement, increase in activity or alterations to any nonconforming use, permanent structure or both. 
b.  No such nonconforming use shall be relocated or moved to any portion of the lot other than that occupied at the time that the nonconforming status was created. 
c.  When a nonconforming use is changed, modified or diversified to meet requirements of a conforming use, the building or structure in which the use is located shall conform to the development standards and regulations as set forth in this Code. 
d.  If any nonconforming use, or any portion thereof, ceases for any reason for more than one year (365 days), the grandfather status of the nonconforming use shall terminate and all subsequent uses shall conform to the regulations of the district in which such use is located. 
(3)  Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the time of the passage or amendment of the land development regulations which could no longer be built under the terms of the land development regulations by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, or other characteristics of the structure or location on lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
a.  That any addition, alteration or renovation to the structure shall not increase the degree of nonconformity or result in the conversion of a nonconforming carport, garage, screen enclosure, patio roof, storage area or other non-habitable area into a habitable area unless specifically approved by the special magistrate. Structural changes which decrease the degree of nonconformity shall be permitted. Structures that are nonconforming due solely to their flood elevation may be altered in accordance with the provisions of chapter 94. 
b.  A nonconforming structure or portion thereof, if damaged by fire, natural elements or force to an amount equal to or greater than 50 percent of its current fair market value as of the day immediately preceding such damage, may only be reconstructed in accordance with the provisions of article V of this chapter regarding district regulations for the district in which it is located and the floodplain management regulations established in chapter 94 of this Code or as otherwise provided in section 110-95. 
c.  Should the damage be less than 50 percent of its current fair market value, then repairs may be made under the "grandfathered" zoning district regulations, provided that they shall be made within 18 months after such damage. All repairs must be made to comply with current building codes and not be in violation of the provisions of the floodplain management regulations and other applicable codes of the city. In the event that the repairs have not been completed within 18 months, the structure shall not be further repaired or rebuilt, except in conformity with the entire requirements of this Code. 
d.  Routine repairs and maintenance of nonconforming structures, fixtures, wiring and plumbing, or the repair or replacement of non-load bearing walls shall be permitted. 
e.  Owners of nonconforming residential structures in an R-1 or R-2 zoning district that wish to elevate their existing structure with the lowest habitable floor at or above base flood elevation shall be exempt from the setback provisions of article V of this chapter regarding district regulations, so long as the structure remains within the existing footprint. 
f.  In recognition of the narrow lot dimensions and the preexisting development patterns in some older neighborhoods, the following exceptions can be considered by the planning commission for approval for lots of 50 feet in width or less: 
1.  Legal nonconforming residential structures in an R-2 or R-3 zoning district with side yard encroachments may extend along the line of the existing encroachment without increasing the depth of the encroachment into the setback as long as a minimum of three feet of setback from the structural wall is retained on one side of the house and a minimum of five feet of clearance remains on the other side of the house (no permanent improvement of any kind, including mechanical equipment or storage units may exist or be placed or installed in the five feet clearance along the entire side of the structure nor can the area be obstructed by landscaping that prevents access across/through the clear area, although the area may be fenced as long as it is accessible by way of a gate). Additionally, the property that is the subject of reduced setbacks must be improved with drainage systems including but not limited to roof gutter systems adequate to carry all runoff and direct it away from the neighboring property in a manner that ensures no impact upon the neighboring property. The required clearance area is not a reduction of setback but a minimum clear path of access between the front and rear yard. Furthermore, extensions along an existing encroachment line can be approved only if the neighbor on the extending encroached side indicates support for the extension by notarized statement. Nothing in this provision can be used to approve the creation of a new nonconformity. 
2.  Legal nonconforming uses and structures in an R-1, R-2 or R-3 zoning districts with a front or rear yard setback encroachment may extend the encroachment to an average of that encroachment on lots adjoining and facing it. 
3.  Additions of a second floor to legal nonconforming structures in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 districts is permitted as long as the extension/addition does not create any new encroachment, does not violate the height restrictions, provides a minimum of 18? clearance between any building element and the property line, and does not increase the depth into any existing encroachment. Approval of such additions require the neighbor on the side or facing property where the encroachment is proposed to be heightened to indicate by notarized statement their support for the addition. 
4.  Approval of such additions require pre-hearing notice to adjoining property owners who may indicate their support for the addition by notarized statement or submittal of written or oral objections prior to or during the planning commission hearing. 
5.  Appeals of planning commission approvals may be brought to the city commission by filing a notice of appeal within 30 days of the signed planning commission decision. 
(4)  Nonconforming characteristics of use. Nonconforming characteristics of use which may include, but not limited to inadequate parking and loading facilities, inappropriate landscaping, lighting, emissions, etc., may continue to operate but shall not be expanded, altered, changed or relocated in such a manner as to increase the degree of nonconformity.

Sec. 110-94. - Nonconforming structures unsafe for reasons other than lack of maintenance. 
    Nonconforming structures or portions thereof which are declared unsafe by the building and zoning official or other competent authority, but not because of lack of maintenance, may be repaired and restored except as provided in subsection 110-94(3). 
(Code 1983, § 20-611(D)) 
Sec. 110-95. - Reestablishment of uses after an involuntary loss. 
(a)  In the event that any residential or hotel/motel structure is damaged greater than 50 percent or destroyed by a hurricane, tornado, fire, flood, wind, storm, natural disaster, or other unintended, involuntary action; it can be repaired or reconstructed in a manner which guarantees that each dwelling unit, tourist unit and all permitted accessory uses can be restored to the same square footage which existed the day immediately preceding such damage. 
(b)  Nothing contained herein shall be construed to permit more dwelling units or an increase in square footage of the structure than existed prior to the day immediately preceding such damage. The burden of proof as to what existed prior to the disaster shall rest with the property owner. Each property owner shall provide the city with a site plan, as-built surveys, or architecturally-sealed floor plans. The plans or surveys shall provide enough information to determine the existing legally permitted development on the site prior to the day immediately preceding such damage. 
(c)  Local business tax receipt required. Failure to have a current required local business tax receipt, where applicable, in force at the time of declared disaster will prevent this section from applying to that property.

(3)  Multifamily in R-1 and R-2 on a nonconforming lot. Multifamily in R-1 and R-2 on a nonconforming lot shall be the same as duplexes and triplexes, except they must comply with the parking regulations as contained in their pre-damage certificate of occupancy. 
(4)  Multifamily, hotel, motel, motor lodges. Multifamily, hotel, motel and motor lodges may be rebuilt to same density, height and side setbacks, but must comply with the front setback, the county coastal construction control line, floodplain regulations, fire codes, and parking regulations as contained in their certificate of occupancy and any other requirements effective at the time of building permit application. 
(5)  Commercial. Commercial may be rebuilt within the same footprint and having the same parking spaces available at the time of disaster, but would have to meet minimum FEMA regulations for elevated structures and/or floodproofing to the required height per the National Flood Rate Insurance Map for its commercial location. 
(6)  Occupational license required. Failure to have a current required occupational license in force at the time of declared disaster will prevent this section from applying to that property.

Any decision to deny such an extension may be appealed to the board of commissioners by filing a written notice of appeal with the city manager within ten days which shall include the fee established by the board of commissioners for such appeals. The appeal shall be processed pursuant to the provisions of the Code regarding appeals to the board of commissioners.

The adult entertainment establishment permit shall remain valid unless it expires or unless the business is voluntarily discontinued for a period of 30 days or more. The adult entertainment establishment permit is not a local business tax receipt and the receipt of the adult entertainment establishment permit shall not relieve the adult entertainment establishment from obtaining a local business tax receipt. Failure to obtain an adult entertainment establishment permit by October 1 of each year will subject the permittee to a penalty of ten percent of the permit fee per each month of delinquency. 
(d)  Decisions by the city manager to revoke an otherwise valid adult entertainment establishment permit for voluntary discontinuance may be appealed to the board of commissioners by filing a written notice of appeal with the city manager within ten days which shall include the fee established by board of commissioners.

Sec. 110-881. - Request for variance; scheduling of hearing. 
(a)  If a proposed use is in violation of the locational requirements of this division the applicant may file with the city manager a written request for a variance from the locational restriction. If an applicant has received a certification of noncompliance because the location of the proposed adult entertainment establishment is in violation of the locational requirements of this division, then the applicant may file with the city manager a written request for a variance from the locational restrictions. Such requests shall be accompanied by the fee established by board of commissioners. Filing of such a request not later than ten calendar days after receiving notice of the certification of noncompliance shall preserve the pending status of the application for purposes of the review of conflicting applications. If the written request is filed more than ten calendar days after receiving such notice, then the date of filing such request shall be used for the purposes of the review of conflicting applications. 
(b)  If a written request is filed with the city manager, a public hearing before the special magistrate shall be scheduled to consider the request for a variance. The city manager shall schedule a date for the hearing to be held within 60 days from the date the written request is received.

Public notice shall be given pursuant to the requirements for variance requests to the special magistrate and shall include property owners of record as shown by the tax rolls of the property appraiser within 300 feet of the proposed location. 
(b)  The special magistrate may, in his discretion, grant a variance, with reasonable conditions, from the locational restrictions of this division if he makes the following findings: 
(1)  That a sufficient physical barrier separates the use for which a variance is being sought from the land use or adult entertainment establishment which has caused the use not to be in compliance with the distance requirements of this division, so as to substantially fulfill the purpose of the distance requirements in effectively buffering the nonadult entertainment establishment. Such physical barriers include, but are not limited to, limited access streets or highways, major streets, walls, buildings or other structures, natural or manmade waterways, or that the actual distances between the buildings is sufficiently in excess of the distance requirement. Where the adult entertainment establishment was legally in existence upon the effective date of the ordinance from which this division was derived, the special magistrate may also consider the history of the site including criminal activity in the area and compliance with city codes, the length it has been at that location and other economic considerations. 
(2)  That the strict application of the provisions of this division will work an undue hardship unique to the applicant for a particular location. 
(3)  That all other applicable provisions of this division and the codes and ordinances of the city will be observed.

DIVISION 14. - MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES 

Sec. 110-940. - Intent 
    With the approval of Florida Constitutional Amendment #2 (Use of Marijuana for Debilitating Medical Conditions), the city commission believes it is in the best interest of the citizens of Madeira Beach to ban medical marijuana treatment center dispensing facilities from being located with the city of Madeira Beach, because there are significant safety and security issues that exist for any establishment involved in the dispensing of medical marijuana, because they maintain large drug inventories and are compelled to conduct business in cash, and because their activities have not yet been sanctioned by federal law. Further, such businesses are inherently attractive targets for criminals, and it is therefore essential that the city prohibit such facilities to protect businesses and the community, to protect and advance the public health, safety and welfare, and to prevent the creation of attractive nuisances. The prohibition of medical marijuana treatment center dispensing facilities contained herein shall be enforced, unless preempted by state law or regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2017-09 , § 2, 11-14-17) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2017-09 , § 2, adopted Nov. 14, 2017, repealed § 110-940 and enacted a new § 110-940, as set out herein. The former § 110-940 pertained to medical marijuana dispensaries and derived from Ord. No. 2015-03, § 3, adopted Feb. 24, 2015. 
Sec. 110-941. - Prohibition. 
    Medical marijuana treatment center dispensing facilities as defined in Florida Statutes ch. 381 are prohibited from siting, locating, opening or operating within the incorporated limits of the city of Madeira Beach, Florida, as may be amended from time to time through annexation.

ARTICLE VII. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING[6] 
Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Cross reference- Stopping, standing and parking generally, § 66-51 et seq. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 110-951. - Intent. 
    It is the intent of this article to: 
(1)  Encourage the appropriate location of off-street parking and off-street loading to provide the needed levels of service to the city; 
(2)  Avoid undue congestion on the streets, to protect the capacity of the street system to move traffic; 
(3)  Avoid unnecessary conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians; 
(4)  Encourage the use and preserve and enhance the designated pedestrian activity areas within the city; and 
(5)  Facilitate access from streets to off-street parking lots and structures. 
(Code 1983, § 20-602(A)) 
Sec. 110-952. - Applicability. 
    The provisions of this article shall apply to all development within the city commencing with the effective date of the ordinance from which the land development regulations were derived. The provisions of this section shall apply to redevelopment or amendments to existing development approvals as follows: 
(1)  Nonresidential development. A change in the permitted use of nonresidential property, building or structure or the conversion of an existing residential use to a nonresidential use shall require that the total parking requirement for the new use be met. An increase in total floor area of a building or structure shall require that the total parking requirement, based upon the existing floor area of structure and the increased floor area be met. 
(2)  Residential development. Changes to approved development plans which result in an increase in the number of dwelling units shall include provisions for the total parking requirement specified in this article. 
(3)  Status of prior approvals. Projects with approved development plans prior to the date of the ordinance from which the land development regulations were derived must meet all parking requirements in effect at the time of the development plan approval. However, should the development plan be amended or expire, the total parking requirements shall be met as stated in this article. 
(Code 1983, § 20-602(B)) 
Sec. 110-953. - Maintenance. 
(a)  Generally. All off-street parking areas shall be well maintained, free of pot holes, debris, weeds, broken curbs and broken wheel stops, clearly striped, and with all lighting in working condition. 
(b)  Exception. Where alternative surface materials have been approved by the building official and striping is inappropriate, this requirement may be waived by the building official. 
(Code 1983, § 20-602(C)) 
Sec. 110-954. - Special parking areas. 
(a)  This section provides for safe and efficient parking while recognizing the unique conditions in these redeveloping areas. Some internal capture of vehicle trips results from the mixture of commercial uses in close proximity. This capture combined with the public on-street parking improvements allows a reduced off-street parking requirement for comparable uses in conventional zoning districts. 
(1)  Madeira Way Town Center Parking Area shall include all property bounded by Gulf Boulevard, 154th Avenue, 149th Avenue, and the Intracoastal Waterway and zoned C-3, C-4, R-3 and PD. 
(2)  John's Pass Village Parking Area shall include all property bounded by John's Pass Channel, Gulf Boulevard, 131st Avenue, Pelican Lane and East End Lane; and zoned PD, C-1 and C-2. 
(b)  The minimum number of parking spaces provided by a principal use in a designated special parking area shall be equal to 50 percent of the minimum off-street vehicle parking spaces required in section 110-971. 
(Ord. No. 1099, § 1(Exh. A), 11-28-06) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1099, § 1(Exh. A), adopted November 28, 2006, added a new § 110-954, and subsequently renumbered the former § 110-954 as 110-955. See note at § 110-955. 
Sec. 110-955. - Methods of providing required parking. 
(a)  Required off-street parking facilities shall be located on the same zoning lot as the use they are intended to serve. However, required off-street parking facilities may be on a different zoning lot as the use the parking facilities are intended to serve if the applicant for an off-site parking facility demonstrates to the city: 
(1)  Practical difficulties prevent the location of the parking facilities on the same zoning lot. 
(2)  A safe, pedestrian route exists, or will be provided, for the safety of pedestrians traveling between the premises and the off-site parking facilities. 
(b)  The approval by the city of the off-site parking facility shall be documented as an off-site parking agreement between the city and the applicant(s) in a form acceptable to the city attorney and shall provide: 
(1)  The land comprising the parking facilities shall not be disposed of except in conjunction with the sale of the premises which the parking area serves, so long as the facilities are required; 
(2)  The owner(s) agrees to bear the expense of recording the agreement and agrees that the agreement shall bind their heirs, successors and assigns; and the owner(s) shall agree to be responsible for the cost of any pedestrian safety devices or improvements. The written agreement shall be voided by the city if other off-street facilities are provided in accordance with these regulations. 
(3)  The use being served by the off-street parking shall be a permitted principal use in the zoning district within which the zoning lot containing such parking is located. 
(4)  The off-street parking shall not be located in an R-1 or R-2 zoning district. 
(5)  The off-street parking shall be located within 300 feet walking distance of a public entrance to the structure or land area containing the use for which such spaces are required. Special parking areas, as identified in section 110-954 may establish off-street parking anywhere within the same identified geographical area. A safe, direct, attractive, lighted and convenient pedestrian route shall be provided between the off-street parking and the use being served. 
(Ord. No. 1099, § 1(Exh. A), 11-28-06) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1099, § 1(Exh. A), adopted November 28, 2006, redesignated the former § 110-954 as § 110-955, and subsequently amended § 110-955 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, § 110-954 pertained to methods of required parking, and derived from the Code of 1983, § 20-602(D). 
Sec. 110-956. - Shared parking facilities. 
(a)  Two or more non-residential uses located on the same or separate zoning lots may provide for shared parking facilities, upon receiving the approval of the city manager or his/her designee. The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city manager or his/her designee that the uses upon the zoning lot(s) are able to share the same parking spaces because their parking demands occur at different times (for example if one use operates during evenings or weekdays only). The applicant shall be required to demonstrate to the city manager or his/her designee that the type of uses(s) indicates that the periods of usage will not overlap or be concurrent and that a reduction in the total number required off-street parking spaces is justified. The applicant shall submit documentation supporting the request for shared parking spaces that shall, at a minimum, include: 
(1)  The uses proposed to share parking and the number of parking spaces required for those uses by this article; 
(2)  The location and number of parking spaces that are being shared including a legal description of the property upon which the uses are located and upon which the shared parking spaces are located; 
(3)  An analysis showing that peak parking times of uses occur at different times and that parking area(s) will have a sufficient number of parking spaces to meet the minimum anticipated demands of all uses sharing the joint parking area(s); and 
(4)  If the shared parking spaces are location off-site then the applicant shall also demonstrate that a safe pedestrian route exists, or will be provided, for the safety of pedestrians traveling between the premises and the off-site parking facilities. 
(b)  The approval by the city manager or his/her designee shall be documented as a shared parking agreement between the city and the applicant(s) in a form acceptable to the city attorney and which: 
(1)  Provides access to the shared parking spaces for all uses identified; 
(2)  Requires the processing of an amendment to the parking agreement for any substitution of uses not identified; 
(3)  Requires the owner(s) to bear the expense of recording the parking agreement and agree that the parking agreement shall bind their heirs, successors and assigns; 
(4)  Requires the parking agreement to be recorded in the public records of the clerk of the circuit court of Pinellas County prior to the issuance of the first building permit or certificate of occupancy for the project and may be voided by the city if other off-street facilities are provided in accordance with these regulations; and 
(5)  Requires the termination of the parking agreement in the event of a violation of any of the following; a provision of this Code, any condition of a related development approval, of any term of condition contained in the agreement, upon provision of reasonable notice to the property owner. 
(c)  A second type of shared parking facility may be requested for two or more non-residential uses located on separate zoning lots, upon receiving the approval of the city manager or his or her designee. Instead of demonstrating justification for a reduction in the total number of required off-street parking spaces as required in subsection (a), the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city manager or his or her designee that the total number of such parking spaces, when combined or used together, shall not be fewer than the sum of the requirements computed separately. The applicant shall submit documentation supporting the request for the shared parking spaces that shall, at a minimum, include: the data required in subsections (a)(1), (2) and (4). The approval by the city manager or his or her designee shall be documented as a shared parking agreement between the city and the applicant(s) in a form acceptable to the city attorney and which shall address the matters enumerated in subsection (b).
