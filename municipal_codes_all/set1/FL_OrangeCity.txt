PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Orange City, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the 2004 republication were the 1996 Code, as supplemented through September 24, 2002, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. There has been no renumbering of sections retained from the city's 1981 and 1996 Codes. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The 1996 publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. This 2004 republication was completed under the supervision of Tassy W. Spinks, Editor.

Sec. 2-8. - Procedures for naming of city buildings, parks and trails. 
(a)  Intent and purpose; findings. The intent and purpose of this section is to establish a uniform method and procedure to assist the city council in naming certain city buildings, parks and trails. The city council hereby finds that the authority to name city buildings, parks and trails is solely vested in the city council. Nothing herein shall be construed as a delegation of any authority to name a city building, park or trail to any other person or entity. The naming of city buildings, parks and trails shall be determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the city council. The city council may name or rename any city building, park, or trail, by resolution, with a simple majority vote of the city council. However, naming or renaming any city building, park or trail after a living individual will require a super majority vote of the city council. 
(b)  Generally. The naming of a city building, park or trail shall be determined by the city council either based on its own initiative or as part of city council approval of a new land development project which consists of a new city building, park, or trail pursuant to the city's land development regulations. 
(c)  Definitions. 
(1)  Naming. The permanent name assigned by the city council via resolution to a given city building, park or trail. 
(2)  Building shall mean any building owned by the City of Orange City. 
(3)  Park shall have the same meaning as "park" as stated in the City of Orange City Code of Ordinances section 10.5-18. 
(4)  Trail shall mean any existing or proposed city trail located within City of Orange City right-of-way and as identified in the Orange City Trails Master Plan. 
(d)  Naming guidelines. When considering the naming of any city building, park or trail the city council shall consider the following naming attributes: 
(1)  Recognized geographic names; 
(2)  Natural historic features; 
(3)  Significant historic contributions to the city, State of Florida, or United States; 
(4)  Significant material or financial contributions to the city; 
(5)  Persons of historic service to the city; 
(6)  Persons of outstanding civic service to the city; and 
(7)  Community support for the name. 
(e)  Other factors. When considering the naming of any city building, park or trail, the city council shall also consider the following other factors: 
(1)  The cost that the naming or renaming will have on the city or any other person that is or could be materially affected by the name or name change; 
(2)  Preference shall be given to names of long established local usage and names that lend dignity to the city building, park, or trail to be named; 
(3)  Names selected shall be of enduring, honorable fame, not notoriety and shall be commensurate with the significance of the city building, park, or trail; 
(4)  Renaming city buildings, parks, or trails will be discouraged where the building, park or trail has previously been named. It is the objective of the city that naming will be for perpetuity. 
(5)  Proliferation of multiple names for different parts of a particular city building, park, or trail shall generally be avoided unless there are readily identifiable physical divisions. For example, a tennis court area within a larger public park may be named differently than the park in which it is located; 
(6)  Persons currently serving on the city council or serving as an existing city employee shall not be considered; 
(7)  Naming proposals that promote alcohol and tobacco products or political organizations will not be considered; 
(8)  Names with connotations which by contemporary community standards are derogatory or offensive shall not be considered; 
(9)  Proliferation of the same name for different city buildings, parks, or trails shall be avoided; 
(10)  If the name is an individual person, whether the individual has ever been convicted of a felony; 
(f)  Requests from the public. Any person or organization may address the city council during public participation to request a specific name for a new city building, park or trail. Council may ask the city manager to evaluate the request for compliance with these guidelines and place it on a future council agenda for consideration.

    If the board determines that a structure is in the course of being "demolished by neglect," the owner shall be notified of the conditions of the structure and the items that need repair. The board may request a meeting with the owner or tenant of the building for the purpose of encouraging positive intervention before code enforcement action becomes necessary.

(Ord. No. 351, § 2, 7-8-08; Ord. No. 547 , § 1(Att. A), 10-13-15) 
Sec. 2-110. - Termination of historic preservation easement. 
    Any owner of property previously burdened by a historic preservation easement may seek elimination of that historic preservation easement by submitting proof of the damage to or destruction of the historic/structure reducing (1) its fair market value by at least 50 percent or (2) the square footage of the historic structure by 50 percent. The developmental services director shall verify and thereafter will execute, as appropriate a release of the historic preservation easement. 
(Ord. No. 351, § 2, 7-8-08) 
Sec. 2-111. - Preservation of historic structures. 
    Any property burdened by a historic preservation easement donated to the city pursuant to section 2-107, in the event of damage, destruction or remodeling of the structure by the property owner, shall hereby enjoy the protection of section 8.2.2 of the Orange City Land Development Code pertaining to nonconforming uses. Thus, to encourage the on-going maintenance and/or necessary reconstruction of historic structures, the owner of said nonconforming historic structure may not only continue to use that structure, notwithstanding its inconsistency with the current standards in Orange City's current Land Development Code, but shall be entitled, as necessary, to rebuild or remodel the historic structure to its original condition. This shall include, but not be limited to: setback requirements, lot coverage and minimum lot size requirements. 
(Ord. No. 351, § 2, 7-8-08) 
Sec. 2-112. - Ad valorem tax exemption. 
(a)  The city council hereby grants, pursuant to authorization of Article III, Section VII, of the Constitution of the State and F.S. § 196.1961, an ad valorem tax exemption of 50 percent of the assessed value of property which meets all of the following criteria: 
(1)  The property must be used for commercial purposes or used by a not-for-profit organization under Section 501(c)(3) or (6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
(2)  The property must be listed in the National Register of Historic Places, as defined in F.S. § 267.021; or must be a contributing property to a National Register Historic District; or must be designated as a historic property or as a contributing property to a historic district, under the terms of a local preservation ordinance. 
(3)  The property must be regularly open to the public. 
(b)  As used in this section, the term "regularly open to the public" means that there are regular hours when the public may visit to observe the historically significant aspects of the building. This means a minimum of 40 hours per week, for 45 weeks per year, or an equivalent of 1,800 hours per year. A fee may be charged to the public; however, it must be comparable with other entrance fees in the immediate geographic locale. 
(c)  Exemption allowed by this section shall apply only to the ad valorem taxes levied by the city. Only the portions of the property used predominantly for the purposes as specified in subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be exempt. In no event shall an incidental use of property qualify such property for an exemption or impair the exemption of an otherwise exempt property. 
(d)  In order to retain the exemption granted in this section, the historic character of the property must be maintained in good repair and condition to the extent necessary to preserve the historic value and significance of the property. 
(Ord. No. 351, § 2, 7-8-08) 
Sec. 2-113. - Exemption from ad valorem taxes-General. 
(a)  Exemption for improvements to historic property (F.S. § 196.1997). The city council may authorize an ad valorem tax exemption of 100 percent of the assessed value of all improvements to historic properties which result from the restoration, renovation, or rehabilitation of such properties. 
(b)  Exemption for historic properties open to the public (Per F.S. § 196.1998). If an improvement qualifies a historic property for an exemption under this division, and the property is used for nonprofit or governmental purposes and is regularly and frequently open for the public's visitation, use, and benefit, the city council may by this article authorize the exemption from ad valorem taxation of 100 percent of the assessed value of the property, as improved, if all other provisions of this division are complied with; provided, however, that the assessed value of the improvement must be equal to at least 50 percent of the total assessed value of the property as improved. The exemption applies only to real property to which improvements are made by or for the use of the existing owner. 
(c)  Application for review. This exemption shall only apply to improvements to real property that are made on or after the day that this article authorizing ad valorem tax exemption for historic properties is adopted. Such exemption shall apply only to taxes levied by the City of Orange City, and do not apply to taxes levied for the payment of bonds or to taxes authorized by a vote of the electors pursuant to sections 9(b) or 12, Article VII of the State Constitution. 
(d)  Duration of exemption. Any exemption granted shall remain in effect for up to ten years with respect to any particular property, regardless of any change in the authority of the City of Orange City to grant such exemptions or any change in ownership of the property. However, for purposes of the exemption under F.S. § 196.1998, a property shall be removed from eligibility for the exemption if the property is sold or otherwise transferred from the owner who made application and was granted the exemption, or the property no longer qualifies as historic property open to the public in accordance with this division. 
    In order to retain the exemption, the historic character of the property, and the improvements which qualified the property for exemption, must be maintained over the period for which the exemption is granted. Such exemption shall take effect on January 1 following substantial completion of the improvement.

ARTICLE IV. - CODE ENFORCEMENT 
DIVISION 1. - CODE ENFORCEMENT THROUGH HEARING OFFICER PROCESS[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 192, §§ 2-11, adopted Apr. 27, 2004, amended div. 1 in its entirety, in effect repealing and reenacting said division to read as herein set out. The former div. 1, §§ 2-131-2-140, pertained to the code enforcement board and derived from Ord. No. 32, §§ 2-11, adopted June 26, 2001. Section 12 of Ord. No. 192 states: "Upon the effective date of this Ordinance, the Code Enforcement Board of the City of Orange City is disbanded and abolished." 

Sec. 2-131. - Intent of division. 
    It is the intent of this division 1 to establish a special master code enforcement process by and through a hearing officer with the authority to impose administrative fines and other noncriminal penalties to protect, promote and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city and to provide an equitable, expeditious, effective and inexpensive method of enforcing the City Code and city ordinances where a pending or repeated violation exists or continues to exist. 
(Ord. No. 192, § 2, 4-27-04) 
Sec. 2-131.5. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in article IV, divisions 1 and 2, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    City shall mean the City of Orange City. 
    Code enforcement officer shall mean any designated or authorized employee(s) or agents(s) of the city, whose duty it is to enforce codes and ordinances enacted by the city. Code enforcement officers may include, but are not limited to, code inspectors, animal control officers, law enforcement officers, or fire safety inspectors. Provided, however, nothing herein shall be construed to authorize any person designated as a code enforcement officer to perform any function or duty of a law enforcement officer, as defined in F.S. §§ 943.05-943.255, other than as specified. 
    Irreparable or irreversible violation means an act or event that is impossible or impractical to change back to a previous or original condition or circumstance. 
    Itinerant or transient violation means a single prohibited infraction rather than ongoing condition or circumstance. 
    Local governing body shall mean the city council of Orange City. 
    Person shall mean individuals, associations, joint ventures, partnerships, corporations, or any other group or combination. 
    Repeat violation means a violation of a provision of a code or ordinance by a person who has been previously found through a code enforcement board or any other quasi-judicial process, to have violated or who has admitted violating the same provision within five years prior to the violation, notwithstanding the violations occur at different locations. 
(Ord. No. 464, § 1(Exh. A), 7-26-11) 
Sec. 2-132. - Appointment, term and compensation. 
(a)  The hearing officer shall be appointed by the city council and shall be an attorney duly licensed to practice law in the State of Florida. 
(b)  The city may utilize the services of one or more hearing officers to conduct hearings concerning the City Code and city ordinances. 
(c)  Hearing officers shall serve for terms established by the city council. Hearing officers shall be subject to removal with or without cause, from their positions at any time during their term, by the city council. Hearing officers shall not be considered to be city employees, although they may receive compensation for their services and also may be reimbursed for such travel, mileage and per diem expenses as may be authorized. 
(d)  The city attorney shall act as legal counsel to the code enforcement officer. Because only attorneys may hold the position of hearing officer, the city council shall not be required to retain an attorney to represent the hearing officer. 
(Ord. No. 192, § 3, 4-27-04) 
Sec. 2-133. - Jurisdiction. 
(a)  The hearing officer shall have the jurisdiction to hear and decide alleged violations of the City Code and city ordinances. 
(b)  The jurisdiction of the hearing officer shall not be exclusive. Any alleged violation of the City Code or city ordinances may be pursued by additional or supplemental means, appropriate remedies in court, at the option of the administrative official whose responsibility it is to enforce respective codes or ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 192, § 4, 4-27-04) 
Sec. 2-134. - Enforcement procedures. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the responsible city departments, through the code enforcement officer, to initiate enforcement proceedings of the City Code and city ordinances through the hearing officer process. The hearing officer shall not have the power to initiate such enforcement proceedings. Any violations presented to the hearing officer shall be administered by the code enforcement officer. 
(b)  In the case of a first-time violation of the City Code or a city ordinance, the code enforcement officer shall notify and give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the code enforcement officer shall schedule a hearing before the hearing officer and written notice of the hearing shall be delivered to the violator by hand-delivery or certified mail, return receipt requested, as provided by section 2-140. At the option of the code enforcement officer, notice may additionally be served by publication or posting as provided in section 2-140. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code enforcement officer, the case may be presented to the hearing officer even if the violation has been corrected prior to the hearing before the hearing officer, and the notice shall so state. 
(c)  If a repeat violation, as defined in F.S. § 162.04, is found the code enforcement officer shall notify the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code enforcement officer, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall schedule a hearing before the hearing officer and the code enforcement officer shall provide notice to the violator of the hearing. The case may be presented to the hearing officer even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the hearing officer hearing and the notice shall so state. If the repeat violation has been corrected, the code enforcement officer retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and to impose the payment of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose to waive his or her rights to this hearing and pay said costs as determined by the code enforcement officer. For purposes of this section, the term "repeat violation" means a violation of a provision of the code or ordinance by a person whom the hearing officer or, previously, the city code enforcement board, has found to have violated the same provision within five years prior to the violation. 
(d)  If a code enforcement officer has reason to believe a violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, said decision being made in conjunction with the city administrator, the code enforcement officer shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately schedule a hearing thereon. 
(e)  If the owner of property which is subject to an enforcement proceeding before the hearing officer transfers ownership of the property between the time the initial pleading or notice was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
(4)  File a notice with the code enforcement official of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after the date of the transfer. 
A failure to make the disclosures described in subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(Ord. No. 192, § 5, 4-27-04) 
Sec. 2-135. - Conduct of hearing. 
(a)  The code enforcement officer shall call hearings by the hearing officer. All hearings by the hearing officer shall be open to the public. 
(b)  Minutes shall be kept of all hearings. 
(c)  The city shall provide a hearing room and clerical staff as may be reasonably required by the hearing officer to conduct hearings and perform his or her duties. 
(d)  Each case before the hearing officer shall be presented by the code enforcement officer. Additionally, the city attorney or the designated city representative may present cases before the hearing officer. All relevant evidence shall be admitted. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern all proceedings. All evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs shall be admissible, whether or not that evidence would be technically admissible in a trial before the state courts. Any part of the evidence may be received in written form acceptable to the hearing officer. 
(e)  Each party to the hearing shall have the right to call and examine witnesses, introduce exhibits, cross-examine opposing witnesses, impeach witnesses and rebut evidence. 
(f)  The alleged violator has the right, at his or her own expense, to be represented by an attorney at any hearing. 
(g)  All testimony before the hearing officer shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The alleged violator or the city may cause a verbatim record of the proceedings to be made. 
(h)  The burden of proof shall be with the code enforcement officer to show by the greater weight of evidence that a code violation exists and that the alleged violator committed, allowed, or was responsible for maintaining the violation. 
(i)  If notice has been provided pursuant to this part of this division and F.S. ch. 162 to the violator of the public hearing, the hearing may be conducted and an order rendered in the absence of the violator. 
(j)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue an order setting forth findings of fact, based on evidence of record, and issue conclusions of law, and shall render relief in the order affording the proper relief consistent with powers granted in this division. A written order shall be issued within a reasonable period of time subsequent to the hearing. The order may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that a fine may be imposed if the order is not complied with by that date. A second hearing shall not be necessary for the fine to begin; provided, however, that the alleged violator shall have the right to request a hearing to determine when compliance has been attained. The order shall be mailed by regular U.S. mail to the violator. 
(k)  A certified copy of an order imposing the fine provided for herein may be recorded in the public records of Volusia County or any other county, and thereafter such order shall constitute a lien against the property on which the violation exists or, if the violator does not own the land involved in the violation, upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator and may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state including levy against personal property, but shall not be deemed otherwise to be a judgment of record except for enforcement purposes. 
(l)  When an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this section and the order is complied with by the dates specified in the order, the hearing officer shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required if an order acknowledging compliance is issued prior to the date set for compliance; provided, however, that an alleged violator shall have the right to request a hearing for the sole purpose of determining when compliance has been attained if the compliance order is entered after the date set for compliance. 
(Ord. No. 192, § 6, 4-27-04; Ord. No. 283, § 1, 10-24-06) 
Sec. 2-136. - Powers of hearing officer. 
    The hearing officer shall have the power to: 
(1)  Adopt rules for the conduct of his or her hearing(s); 
(2)  Subpoena alleged violators and witnesses to the hearings. Subpoenas may be served by the city police department or the Sheriff of Volusia County; 
(3)  Subpoena evidence to the hearings; 
(4)  Administer oaths and take testimony under oath; 
(5)  Issue orders having the force of law finding a violation of the City Code or city ordinances and commanding whatever steps are necessary to bring the violation into compliance; and 
(6)  Enter orders finding compliance. 
(Ord. No. 192, § 7, 4-27-04) 
Sec. 2-137. - Administrative fines; liens. 
(a)  Authority. The code enforcement hearing officer, upon determining that his or her previous order has not been complied with in the time set by him or her or upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in the amount specified in the order of the hearing officer for each day the violation continues past the date set by the hearing officer for compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation for each day the repeat violation continues past the date of notice to the violator of the repeat violation. If a finding of a repeat violation has been made as provided in this division, a hearing shall not be necessary for the issuance of an order imposing the fine. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in section 2-134(d), the hearing officer shall notify the city council, which may direct that all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance be made, and thereafter charge the violator with the reasonable costs of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the city to make further repairs or maintain the property and it does not create any liability against the city for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If after due notice and hearing, the hearing officer finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, he or she may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in subsection (b). 
(b)  Maximum fine; consistency; reduction of fines. 
(1)  A fine imposed pursuant to this division shall not exceed $250.00 per day per violation for a first violation and shall not exceed $500.00 per day per violation for a repeat violation, and, in addition, may include all costs for repairs pursuant to subsection (a). However, if the code enforcement hearing officer finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, he or she may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per violation. 
(2)  In formulating the provisions of the order, the hearing officer should be consistent in the imposition of fines, paying special attention to the gravity of the violation, any actions and the timeliness of actions taken by a violator to correct the violation and any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(3)  The hearing officer may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this division if warranted based upon a request of a violator. 
(c)  Lien. 
(1)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records of Volusia County or any other county and therefore shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. All liens filed by the code enforcement hearing officer shall be liens coequal with the lien of all state, county, district, and municipal taxes, superior in dignity to all other liens, titles, and claims, until paid or extinguished. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of the state, including levy against personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. 
(2)  Where a certified copy of an order imposing a penalty or fine, as described above, has been recorded in the public records and has become a lien against the land and/or property of the violator, the property owner, the property owner's successors and assigns who have an ownership interest in the property, or a prospective purchaser of the property, i.e. a party to a contract to purchase the property (such violator/property owner, successor or assign, contract buyer collectively referred to as "applicant") may apply for a reduction or release of such lien as follows: 
a.  Upon full payment by the applicant of the lien amount, the city manager or designee is hereby authorized to execute and record a satisfaction of lien. 
b.  Upon request for a reduction or forgiveness of the lien amount, the applicant shall submit a written application to code enforcement staff. 
c.  The application shall be executed under oath and sworn to in the presence of a notary and shall include, but may not be limited to the following: 
1.  The code enforcement case number; 
2.  The specific code violations at issue on the property; 
3.  The date the property was brought into compliance with the city code; 
4.  The reasons compliance was not obtained prior to the deadline for compliance established by the code enforcement special magistrate; 
5.  Whether the applicant claims special financial difficulties that prevented the applicant from bringing the property into compliance or from paying the full amount of the lien; 
6.  If the applicant was not the owner or tenant at the time the violations were found and the fines imposed, but purchased the property thereafter, was the applicant aware of the city's lien before purchasing the property. If applicant contends he/she was not aware of the lien prior to purchase, attach a copy of any title policy or title work for the subject property; 
7.  The amount of the reduction being sought; and 
8.  Any other information which the applicant deems pertinent to the request, including but not limited to the circumstances that exist which would warrant the reduction or forgiveness of the lien amount. 
d.  The applicant shall submit at the time of application an application fee established by the city by resolution to defray some or all of the city's costs of processing the application and for recording costs. Such fee is non-refundable without regard to the final disposition of the application. 
e.  Upon receipt of the application, code enforcement staff shall confirm whether the violation(s) that was the basis for the lien has been corrected and, thereafter submit the application to the hearing officer for review and consideration. The city council hereby delegates to the hearing officer the authority to review and decide upon applications for reductions of liens. 
f.  The hearing officer shall consider the following factors in determining whether to reduce the amount of the lien: 
1.  The gravity of the violation; 
2.  The actions taken by the applicant to correct the violations and the time in which it took to bring the property into compliance; 
3.  The accrued amount of the code enforcement fine or lien; 
4.  Any previous or subsequent code violations; 
5.  The applicant's prior knowledge of the lien; 
6.  Any financial hardship; and 
7.  Any other mitigating circumstances which may warrant the reduction of the lien. 
g.  The hearing officer may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application for release or reduction of the lien. To the maximum extent feasible, the hearing officer shall collect, at a minimum, all administrative and out-of-pocket costs incurred by the city relating to the code enforcement action for the subject property. If the hearing officer approves a reduction of the lien amount, applicant shall have an amount of time set by the hearing officer from the date the decision is conveyed to applicant to pay the reduced lien amount in full and to comply with any conditions imposed by the hearing officer. Unless special payment arrangements are set forth in the hearing officer's written decision, applicant's failure to pay in full or comply with any conditions established by the hearing officer within the time frame set forth by the hearing officer results in the automatic denial of the application and the lien amount shall revert back to the original lien amount. 
h.  If the application is denied or if the applicant failed to timely pay the reduced lien amount, the applicant shall thereafter be barred from applying for a subsequent reduction or forgiveness of the lien for a period of one year from the date of denial.

ARTICLE V. - INVESTMENT PLAN[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 354, § 1, adopted June 24, 2008, amended Art. V, §§ 2-181-2-189, in its entirety, in effect deleting former Art. V, §§ 2-181-2-189, and enacting a new Art. V, §§ 2-181-2-188, to read as set out herein. Former Art. V, §§ 2-181-2-189, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 98-08-01, § 1, 4-14-98. 

Sec. 2-181. - Scope. 
    This investment plan shall apply to funds under the control of the City of Orange City, Florida (hereinafter "city") in excess of those required to meet current expenses. This investment policy shall not apply to pension funds, including those funds in F.S. chapters 175 and 185. Nor shall this investment plan apply to funds related to the issuance of debt where there are other existing policies or indentures in effect for such funds, however, absent such other controlling documents this plan shall apply to such funds. The city manager or designee will consolidate, where practicable and allowable, for the purposes of investment, cash balances and investments from all funds covered by this policy to maximize investment earnings and reduce risks. The investment of funds shall comply with all controlling state statutes, ordinances and covenants covering the city's investments. 
(Ord. No. 354, § 1, 6-24-08) 
Sec. 2-182. - General objectives. 
    The primary objectives, in priority order, of investment activities shall be safety, liquidity, yield and transparency: 
(1)  Safety and legality. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. The objective will be to limit credit risk and interest rate risk to a level commensurate with the risks associated with prudent investment practices and performance benchmarks, if applicable. 
a.  Credit risk. The city will limit credit risk, the risk of loss due to the failure of the security issuer or backer, by diversifying the investment portfolio so that potential losses on individual securities will be minimized and by limiting investments to specified credit ratings. 
b.  Interest rate risk. The city will minimize the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio will fall due to changes in general interest rates by limiting the maximum term to maturities of all securities in the portfolio to three years. 
(2)  Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature to meet anticipated demands (static liquidity). Furthermore, since all possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should consist largely of securities with active secondary or resale markets (dynamic liquidity). The portfolio may be placed in local government investment pools or money market mutual funds that offer same-day liquidity for short-term funds. 
(3)  Yield. The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return, as measured by specified benchmarks, throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described above. The core investments are limited to relatively low-risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair return relative to the risk being assumed. Securities shall not be sold prior to maturity with the following exceptions: 
a.  A security with declining credit may be sold early to minimize loss of principal. 
b.  A security swap that would improve the quality, yield, or target duration in the portfolio. 
c.  Liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be sold. 
(4)  Transparency. The city shall operate its portfolio in a transparent manner, making its periodic reports both available for public inspection and designed in a manner which communicates clearly and fully information about the portfolio, including market pricing, adjusted book value, yields, and Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures (CUSIPs) of various securities. 
(Ord. No. 354, § 1, 6-24-08) 
Sec. 2-183. - Standards of care. 
(a)  Prudence. The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the Prudent Person Rule and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. City personnel, acting in accordance with this investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported to the city council in a timely fashion and the liquidity and the sale of securities are carried out in accordance with the terms of this policy. 
    The Prudent Person Rule states that: 
"Investments should be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived from the investment." 
(b)  Ethics and conflicts of interest. The city manager or designee shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions. These investment officials shall disclose annually, in a written statement, any material interests in financial institutions with which they conduct business. They shall further disclose any personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the investment portfolio. They shall refrain from undertaking personal investment transactions with the same individual(s) with whom business is conducted on behalf of the city. 
(c)  Delegation of authority. Authority to manage the investment program is granted to the city manager or designee and other authorized personnel. Additional authorized personnel include any other person or position approved by the city council. The city may seek professional advice and therefore may contract with a federally registered investment advisory firm that specializes in public funds fixed income management. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy. The city manager or designee shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials. 
(Ord. No. 354, § 1, 6-24-08) 
Sec. 2-184. - Broker dealers, safekeeping and custody. 
(a)  Authorized financial dealers and institutions. The city shall list financial institutions consisting of banks and other depository institutions authorized to provide depository and investment services. In addition, a list will be maintained of approved security broker/dealers consisting of "primary" dealers or regional dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 15C3-1 (uniform net capital rule). Both lists shall be reviewed by the city manager or designee at least annually. 
(b)  Annual review. An annual review of the financial conditions and registration of qualified financial institutions and broker/dealers will be conducted by the city manager or designee and/or investment advisor under the direction of the city. The distribution of trading among the approved broker/dealers of securities which at the time of purchase had maturities greater than seven days shall be reported annually to the city council. 
(c)  Delivery vs. payment. Securities transactions between a broker-dealer and the safekeeping agent or custodian involving purchase or sale of securities by transfer of money or securities must be made on a "delivery vs. payment" basis, if applicable, to ensure that the custodian will have the security or money, as appropriate, in hand at the conclusion of the transaction. 
(d)  Safekeeping, custody and perfection of interest. Securities shall be held with a third party; and all securities purchased by, and all collateral obtained by, the city should be properly designated as an asset of the city. No withdrawal of securities, in whole or in part, shall be made from safekeeping or custody, except by an authorized staff member of the city. 
(Ord. No. 354, § 1, 6-24-08) 
Sec. 2-185. - Suitable and authorized investments. 
    This investment plan is authorized by the city council. Investments not listed in the investment plan are prohibited. 
    The investment portfolio shall be structured in such manner as to provide sufficient liquidity to pay obligations as they come due. To that end, the investment plan should direct that, to the extent possible, an attempt will be made to match investment maturities with known cash needs and anticipated cash-flow requirements. Prior to conducting transactions as authorized by this plan the city manager or designee shall determine the approximate maturity date based on cash-flow needs and market conditions, analyze and select one or more optimal types of investment, and competitively bid the security in question when feasible and appropriate. Except as otherwise required by law, the bid deemed to best meet the investment objectives shall be selected. Consistent with the Florida Statutes the following investments will be permitted by this policy: 
(1)  Authorized issuers. The criteria for authorized investments is broken down into four sections. Each investment must comply with the provisions of each section. These sections address who can issue authorized investments, what minimum credit ratings these investments must have, what maturity or other limitations apply concerning interest rate risk, and how much of any security may be held. Subject to additional restrictions in this Part V, securities may be held that are issued by: 
a.  The United States Treasury and Agency securities. Securities that are issued by the United States Treasury or those for which the full faith and credit of the United States government guarantees fully all principal and interests payments. 
b.  Government sponsored enterprises (GSE). Securities issued by the Federal Farm Credit Bank, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal National Mortgage Association, or the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. Any other GSE shall be considered as corporate debt for the purposes of this Policy and shall be authorized under the criteria set forth in subsection d. Corporations (below). 
c.  State and local governments. General or revenue obligation of any state of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any territorial possession of the United States, or, of any political subdivision, institution, department, agency, instrumentality, or authority of any of such governmental entities.

h.  Repurchase agreements. Securities referred to in paragraph a. or b. of this subsection (1) and that can otherwise be purchased under this plan may be subject to a repurchase agreement. Such securities subject to this agreement must have a coupon rate that is fixed from the time of settlement until its maturity date, and must be marketable. Such securities must be delivered to the entity or to a third-party custodian or third-party trustee for safekeeping on behalf of the public entity. The collateral securities of any repurchase agreement must be collateralized at no less than 102 percent and marked to market no less frequently than weekly. All approved institutions and dealers transacting repurchase agreements shall execute and perform as stated in the master repurchase agreement. All repurchase agreement transactions shall adhere to the requirements of the master repurchase agreement. Repurchase agreement transactions will not be used as a means to borrow. 
i.  Limitations on derivative securities. No city funds shall be invested in any security issued by entities authorized in this subsection (1) on which the coupon rate (or a schedule of stepped fixed coupon rates) is not fixed from the time the security is settled until its maturity date, other than shares in qualified money market mutual funds or local government investment pool, unless the coupon rate is: (a) Established by reference to the rate on a United States treasury security with a maturity of one year or less, or to the United States dollar London Interbank offer rate of one year or less maturity, or to the cost of funds index or the prime rate as published by the federal reserve; and (b) Expressed as a positive value of the referenced index plus or minus a fixed number of basis points. A municipal index may be used for the investment of bond or note accounts from issues with coupons linked to the same index. For purposes of this section, "maturity date" means the last possible date, barring default, that principal can be repaid to the purchaser. 
(2)  Credit ratings. Securities may be purchased if at the time of purchase the securities meet the following credit quality criteria:

Neither Standard & Poor's, Moody's nor Fitch may rate this security below AAA/Aaa/AAA, respectively, otherwise any security below this rating shall for the purposes of this policy be treated as corporate debt subject to the restrictions of sections 2-182 through 2-184 of this article V. 
b.  Government sponsored enterprises (GSE) Authorization of the listed GSE in subsection (1)b is predicated upon these institutions maintaining at least two AAA/Aaa/AAA long-term credit ratings from Standard & Poor's, Moody's or Fitch, respectively. Should any of these credit rating agencies assign a long-term credit rating to any listed GSE below AAA/Aaa, the GSE shall be considered as corporate debt subject to the restrictions of sections 2-182 through 2-184 of this article V. 
c.  State and local governments. At the time of purchase, such securities must carry at least two long-term credit rating of AAA/Aaa/AAA from Standard & Poor's, Moody's or Fitch, respectively and neither Standard & Poor's, Moody's nor Fitch may rate this security below AAA/Aaa/AAA, respectively.

(1)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within nearby cities or counties in central Florida where books, magazines, periodicals or other printed material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, videotapes, slides, or other visual representations or recordings, or recordings or other audio matter, or instruments, novelties, devices, or paraphernalia, which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas are possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold. 
(2)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within nearby cities or counties in central Florida where dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, for commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas, or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers. 
(3)  When the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) are present in establishments, other activities which are illegal, unsafe, or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property. 
(4)  When the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) are competitively exploited in establishments, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the particular crimes described in subsection (3), and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(5)  The establishments in which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur often are constructed, in part or in whole, of substandard materials, maintained in a manner reflecting disregard for the health and safety of the occupants, and have exterior signs or appearance that lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline. 
(6)  The activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur at establishments which operate for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the health, safety, economy, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the city. 
(7)  The activities described in subsections (1) and (2) often occur in establishments concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
(8)  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community. 
(9)  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) creates additional hazards to the health and safety of persons in attendance and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life, tone of commerce, and community environment. 
(10)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the city it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages at establishments where the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur. 
(11)  Employees of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than employees of other establishments. 
(12)  Physical contact or touching within establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur between employees exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
(13)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city, it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, employees, entertainers, performers, and customers at establishments where the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur. 
(14)  The potential dangers to the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting an establishment at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this chapter are so great as to require the licensing of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate. 
(15)  Requiring operators of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur to keep a list of information concerning current employees and certain recent past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects, and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(16)  Prohibiting establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur from operating within set distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, residences, areas zoned or designated for residential use, and parks, at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect minors from the adverse affects of the activities that accompany such establishments. 
(17)  Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, and enclosed adult booths in establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression.

SECTION 105 
PERMITS 
    105.1 Required. Any owner or authorized agent who intends to construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, demolish, or change the occupancy of a building or structure, or to erect, install, enlarge, alter, repair, remove, convert or replace any required impact-resistant coverings, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, the installation of which is regulated by this code, or to cause any such work to be done, shall first make application to the building official and obtain the required permit. 
105.1.1 Annual facility permit. In lieu of an individual permit for each alteration to an existing electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing or interior nonstructural office system(s), the building official is authorized to issue an annual permit for any occupancy to facilitate routine or emergency service, repair, refurbishing, minor renovations of service systems or manufacturing equipment installations/relocations. The building official shall be notified of major changes and shall retain the right to make inspections at the facility site as deemed necessary. An annual facility permit shall be assessed an annual fee and shall be valid for one year from date of issuance. A separate permit shall be obtained for each facility and for each construction trade, as applicable. The permit application shall contain a general description of the parameters of work intended to be performed during the year. 
105.1.2 Annual permit records. The person to whom an annual permit is issued shall keep a detailed record of alterations made under such annual permit. The building official shall have access to such records at all times or such records shall be filed with the building official as designated. 
105.1.3 Food permit. As per § 500.12, Florida Statutes, a food permit from the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is required of any person who operates a food establishment or retail store. 
    105.2 Work exempt from permit. Exemptions from permit requirements of this code shall not be deemed to grant authorization for any work to be done in any manner in violation of the provisions of this code. Permits shall not be required for the following: 
Gas: 
1.  Portable heating appliance. 
2.  Replacement of any minor part that does not alter approval of equipment or make such equipment unsafe. 
Mechanical: 
1.  Portable heating appliance. 
2.  Portable ventilation equipment. 
3.  Portable cooling unit. 
4.  Steam, hot or chilled water piping within any heating or cooling equipment regulated by this code.

7.  Self-contained refrigeration system containing 10 pounds (4.54 kg) or less of refrigerant and actuated by motors of 1 horsepower (746 W) or less. 
8.  The installation, replacement, removal, or metering of any load management control device. 
Plumbing: 
1.  The stopping of leaks in drains, water, soil, waste or vent pipe provided, however, that if any concealed trap, drain pipe, water, soil, waste or vent pipe becomes defective and it becomes necessary to remove and replace the same with new material, such work shall be considered as new work and a permit shall be obtained and inspection made as provided in this code. 
2.  The clearing of stoppages or the repairing of leaks in pipes, valves or fixtures, and the removal and reinstallation of water closets, provided such repairs do not involve or require the replacement or rearrangement of valves, pipes or fixtures. 
105.2.1 Emergency repairs. Where equipment replacements and repairs must be performed in an emergency situation, the permit application shall be submitted within the next working business day to the building official. 
105.2.2 Minor repairs.

105.2.3 Public service agencies. Reserved. 
    105.3 Application for permit. To obtain a permit, the applicant shall first file an application therefore in writing on a form furnished by the building department for that purpose. Permit application forms shall be in the format prescribed by a local administrative board, if applicable, and must comply with the requirements of Section 713.135(5) and (6). 
    Each application shall be inscribed with the date of application, and the code in effect as of that date. For a building permit for which an application is submitted prior to the effective date of the latest edition of Florida Building Code, the state minimum building code in effect in the permitting jurisdiction on the date of the application governs the permitted work for the life of the permit and any extension granted to the permit. 
105.3.1 Action on application. The building official shall examine or cause to be examined applications for permits and amendments thereto within a reasonable time after filing. If the application or the construction documents do not conform to the requirements of pertinent laws, the building official shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefore. If the building official is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this code and laws and ordinances applicable thereto, the building official shall issue a permit therefore as soon as practicable. When authorized through contractual agreement with school board, in acting on applications for permits, the building official shall give first priority to any applications for the construction of, or addition or renovation to, any school or educational facility. 
105.3.1.1 If a state university, state community college, or public school district elects to use a local government's code enforcement offices, fees charged by counties and municipalities for enforcement of the Florida Building Code on buildings, structures, and facilities of state universities, state colleges, and public school districts shall not be more than the actual labor and administrative costs incurred for plans review and inspections to ensure compliance with the code. 
105.3.1.2 No permit may be issued for any building construction, erection, alteration, modification, repair, or addition unless the applicant for such permit provides to the enforcing agency which issues the permit any of the following documents which apply to the construction for which the permit is to be issued and which shall be prepared by or under the direction of an engineer registered under chapter 471 Florida Statutes: 
1.  Electrical documents for any new building or addition which requires an aggregate service capacity of 600 amperes (240 volts) or more on a residential electrical system or 800 amperes (240 volts) or more on a commercial or industrial electrical system and which costs more than $50,000. 
2.  Plumbing documents for any new building or addition which requires a plumbing system with more than 250 fixture units or which costs more than $50,000. 
3.  Fire sprinkler documents for any new building or addition which includes a fire sprinkler system which contains 50 or more sprinkler heads. A Contractor I, Contractor II, or Contractor IV, certified under § 633.521, may design a fire sprinkler system of 49 or fewer heads and may design the alteration of an existing fire sprinkler system if the alteration consists of the relocation, addition or deletion of not more than 49 heads, notwithstanding the size of the existing fire sprinkler system. 
4.  Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning documents for any new building or addition which requires more than a 15-ton-per-system capacity which is designed to accommodate 100 or more persons or for which the system costs more than $50,000. This paragraph does not include any document for the replacement or repair of an existing system in which the work does not require altering a structural part of the building or for work on a residential one-family, two-family, three-family or four-family structure. 
An air-conditioning system may be designed by an installing air-conditioning contractor certified under Chapter 489, Florida Statutes to serve any building or addition which is designed to accommodate fewer than 100 persons and requires an air-conditioning system with value of $50,000 or less; and when a 15-ton-per system or less is designed for a singular space of a building and each 15-ton system or less has an independent duct system. Systems not complying with the above require design documents that are to be sealed by a professional engineer. 
Example 1: When a space has two 10-ton systems with each having an independent duct system, the contractor may design these two systems since each unit (system) is less than 15 tons. 
Example 2: Consider a small single story office building which consists of 6 individual offices where each office has a single three-ton package air conditioning heat pump. The six heat pumps are connected to a single water cooling tower. The cost of the entire heating, ventilation and air conditioning work is $47,000 and the office building accommodates fewer than 100 persons. Because the six mechanical units are connected to a common water tower this is considered to be an 18-ton system. It therefore could not be designed by a mechanical or air conditioning contractor. 
NOTE: It was further clarified by the Commission that the limiting criteria of 100 persons and $50,000 apply to the building occupancy load and the cost for the total air-conditioning system of the building. 
5.  Any specialized mechanical, electrical, or plumbing document for any new building or addition which includes a medical gas, oxygen, steam, vacuum, toxic air filtration, halon, or fire detection and alarm system which costs more than $5,000. 
Documents requiring an engineer seal by this part shall not be valid unless a professional engineer who possesses a valid certificate of registration has signed, dated, and stamped such document as provided in § 471.025 Florida Statutes. 
105.3.2 Time limitation of application. An application for a permit for any proposed work shall be deemed to have been abandoned, becoming null and void 180 days after the date of filing, unless such application has been pursued in good faith or a permit has been issued; except that the building official is authorized to grant one or more extensions of time for additional periods not exceeding 90 days each. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. 
105.3.3 An enforcing authority may not issue a building permit for any building construction, erection, alteration, modification, repair or addition unless the permit either includes on its face or there is attached to the permit the following statement: "NOTICE: In addition to the requirements of this permit, there may be additional restrictions applicable to this property that may be found in the public records of this county, and there may be additional permits required from other governmental entities such as water management districts, state agencies, or federal agencies." 
105.3.4 A building permit for a single-family residential dwelling must be issued within 30 working days of application there for unless unusual circumstances require a longer time for processing the application or unless the permit application fails to satisfy the Florida Building Code or the enforcing agency's laws or ordinances. 
105.3.5 Identification of minimum premium policy. Except as otherwise provided in Chapter 440, Workers' Compensation, every employer shall, as a condition to receiving a building permit, show proof that it has secured compensation for its employees as provided in §§ 440.10 and 440.38, Florida Statutes. 
105.3.6 Asbestos removal. Moving, removal or disposal of asbestos-containing materials on a residential building where the owner occupies the building, the building is not for sale or lease, and the work is performed according to the owner-builder limitations provided in this paragraph. To qualify for exemption under this paragraph, an owner must personally appear and sign the building permit application. The permitting agency shall provide the person with a disclosure statement in substantially the following form: 
Disclosure Statement: State law requires asbestos abatement to be done by licensed contractors. You have applied for a permit under an exemption to that law. The exemption allows you, as the owner of your property, to act as your own asbestos abatement contractor even though you do not have a license. You must supervise the construction yourself. You may move, remove or dispose of asbestos-containing materials on a residential building where you occupy the building and the building is not for sale or lease, or the building is a farm outbuilding on your property. If you sell or lease such building within 1 year after the asbestos abatement is complete, the law will presume that you intended to sell or lease the property at the time the work was done, which is a violation of this exemption. You may not hire an unlicensed person as your contractor. Your work must be done according to all local, state and federal laws and regulations which apply to asbestos abatement projects. It is your responsibility to make sure that people employed by you have licenses required by state law and by county or municipal licensing ordinances. 
105.3.7 Public-of-way. A permit shall not be given by the building official for the construction of any building, or for the alteration of any building where said building is to be changed and such change will affect the exterior walls, bays, balconies, or other appendages or projections fronting on any street, alley or public lane, or for the placing on any lot or premises of any building or structure removed from another lot or premises, unless the applicant has received a right-of-way permit from the authority having jurisdiction over the street, alley or public lane. 
    105.4 Conditions of the permit. 
105.4.1 Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter or set aside any of the provisions of the technical codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction or violations of this code. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the work is commenced. 
105.4.1.1 If work has commenced and the permit is revoked, becomes null and void, or expires because of lack of progress or abandonment, a new permit covering the proposed construction shall be obtained before proceeding with the work. 
105.4.1.2 If a new permit is not obtained within 180 days from the date the initial permit became null and void, the building official is authorized to require that any work which has been commenced or completed be removed from the building site. Alternately, a new permit may be issued on application, providing the work in place and required to complete the structure meets all applicable regulations in effect at the time the initial permit became null and void and any regulations which may have become effective between the date of expiration and the date of issuance of the new permit. 
105.4.1.3 Work shall be considered to be in active progress when the permit has received an approved inspection within 180 days. This provision shall not be applicable in case of civil commotion or strike or when the building work is halted due directly to judicial injunction, order or similar process. 
105.4.1.4 The fee for renewal reissuance and extension of a permit shall be set forth by the administrative authority. 
    105.5 Expiration. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work on the site authorized by such permit is commenced within 180 days after its issuance, or if the work authorized on the site by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 180 days after the time the work is commenced. Failure to obtain an approved inspection within 180 days of the previous approved inspection shall constitute suspension or abandonment. The building official is authorized to grant, in writing, one or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 180 days each. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Permits issued for the demolition of a structure shall expire sixty (60) days from the date of issuance. For a justifiable cause, one (1) extension of time for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days may be allowed. Such request shall be in writing to the building official. 
    105.6 Suspension or revocation. The building official is authorized to suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this code wherever the permit is issued in error or on the basis of incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete information, or in violation of any ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of this code. 
    105.7 Placement of permit. The building permit or copy shall be kept on the site of the work until the completion of the project. 
    105.8 Notice of commencement. As per § 713.135 Florida Statutes, when any person applies for a building permit, the authority issuing such permit shall print on the face of each permit card in no less than 14-point, capitalized, boldfaced type: "WARNING TO OWNER: YOUR FAILURE TO RECORD A NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT MAY RESULT IN YOUR PAYING TWICE FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO YOUR PROPERTY. IF YOU INTEND TO OBTAIN FINANCING, CONSULT WITH YOUR LENDER OR AN ATTORNEY BEFORE RECORDING YOUR NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT." 
    105.9 Asbestos. The enforcing agency shall require each building permit for the demolition or renovation of an existing structure to contain an asbestos notification statement which indicates the owner's or operator's responsibility to comply with the provisions of § 469.003 Florida Statutes and to notify the Department of Environmental Protection of her or his intentions to remove asbestos, when applicable, in accordance with state and federal law. 
    105.10 Certificate of protective treatment for prevention of termites. A weather resistant jobsite posting board shall be provided to receive duplicate Treatment Certificates as each required protective treatment is completed, providing a copy for the person the permit is issued to and another copy for the building permit files. The Treatment Certificate shall provide the product used, identity of the applicator, time and date of the treatment, site location, area treated, chemical used, percent concentration and number of gallons used, to establish a verifiable record of protective treatment. If the soil chemical barrier method for termite prevention is used, final exterior treatment shall be completed prior to final building approval. 
    105.11 Notice of termite protection. A permanent sign which identifies the termite treatment provider and need for re-inspection and treatment contract renewal shall be provided. The sign shall be posted near the water heater or electric panel. 
    105.12 Work starting before permit issuance. Upon approval of the building official, the scope of work delineated in the building permit application and plan may be started prior to the final approval and issuance of the permit, provided any work completed is entirely at risk of the permit applicant and the work does not proceed past the first required inspection. 
    105.13 Phased permit approval. After submittal of the appropriate construction documents, the building official is authorized to issue a permit for the construction of foundations or any other part of a building or structure before the construction documents for the whole building or structure have been submitted. The holder of such permit for the foundation or other parts of a building or structure shall proceed at the holder's own risk with the building operation and without assurance that a permit for the entire structure will be granted. Corrections may be required to meet the requirements of the technical codes. 
    105.14 Permit issued on basis of an affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity to the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the building official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity to the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the technical codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the building official. The building official shall ensure that any person conducting plans review is qualified as a plans examiner under part XII of chapter 468, Florida Statutes and that any person conducting inspections is qualified as a building inspector under Part III of chapter 468, Florida Statutes. 
    105.15 When any activity requiring a building permit that is applied for on or after July 1, 2008, and for which the estimated cost is $50,000 or more for a building that is located in the wind borne debris region as defined in the Florida Building Code and that has an insured value of $750,000 or more, or, if the building is uninsured or for which documentation of insured value is not presented, has a just valuation for the structure for purposes of ad valorem taxation of $750,000 or more. Opening protections as required within the Florida Building Code, Building or Florida Building Code, Residential for new construction shall be provided.

    106.1 Submittal documents. Construction documents, special inspection and structural observation programs, and other data shall be submitted in one or more sets with each application for a permit. The construction documents shall be prepared by a design professional where required by the statutes. Where special conditions exist, the building official is authorized to require additional construction documents to be prepared by a design professional. 
    Exception: The building official is authorized to waive the submission of construction documents and other data not required to be prepared by a registered design professional if it is found that the nature of the work applied for is such that review of construction documents is not necessary to obtain compliance with this code. If the design professional is an architect or engineer legally registered under the laws of this state regulating the practice of architecture as provided for in FS Chapter 481, Part II, or engineering as provided for in FS Chapter 471 & 61G15 Florida Administrative Code then he/she shall affix his/her official seal, original signature and date to said drawings, specifications and accompanying data, as required by Florida Statute.

(Ord. No. 27, § 3, 11-28-00) 
Sec. 5.3-29. - Use of streets. 
(a)  Before any construction is commenced, the franchisee shall obtain all required and approved construction permits from the city and any other permits as may be required by law, and provide two business days notice prior to start of construction. The franchisee shall pay any and all inspection fees associated with obtaining such permits. The city shall have the right to inspect all construction or installation work performed by the franchisee in the city's streets. The franchisee must restore private property and public thoroughfares to their former conditions in a reasonable manner acceptable to the city; if this is not done within a reasonable amount of time, the city or private property owners may, after prior written notice to the franchisee, cause reasonable repairs to be made at the expense of the franchisee. 
(b)  The franchisee shall file with the city manager for approval plans and specifications for the location or relocation of all facilities located within the rights-of-way of the city, excluding drops and maintenance of existing plant, and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The facilities shall be so located or relocated and so erected or installed so as not to obstruct or interfere with the use of streets, alleys, easements, and other public ways and places, or other utilities or structures already installed or hereinafter to be installed, subject at all times to the lawful police power of the city. 
    Any unreasonable obstruction of any street, alley, avenue, bridge, easement or other public place or way of the city not promptly removed by the franchisee after written notice by the city demanding removal thereof, or not properly repaired by the franchisee after its work therein, after written notice by the city demanding repair thereof, may be removed or repaired, as the case may be, by the city and the reasonable cost thereof plus ten percent of such cost for administration and engineering expenses, shall be charged against said franchisee and shall be collectible by the city in any lawful manner, and all costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the city in such enforcement shall be paid by the franchisee to the city. 
(c)  The franchisee may trim trees on private property at the franchisee's expense, with prior approval of the property owner. The franchisee may trim trees on public rights-of-way at its own expense, but only after written notification to and the approval of the city. Approval will be deemed granted within three business days after written notification to the city if the city has not contacted the franchisee. In addition, removal of trees for new construction shall first require tree removal permits to be obtained by the franchisee at its expense. 
(d)  At the request of any person holding a valid building moving permit, the franchisee must temporarily raise, lower or cut its wires, as necessary to facilitate such move, upon not less than three business days advance notice. The direct expense of such temporary changes must be paid by the permit holder and the franchisee may require payment in advance. 
(e)  The franchisee must utilize existing poles, conduits, or other such facilities wherever possible, if available on reasonable terms and conditions. All transmission lines and structures must be installed to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners. The franchisee must obtain permission from the city before erecting any new poles or underground conduit at the time the franchisee seeks to install any new lines. Approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(f)  On streets and roads where electrical and telephone utility wiring is installed underground, at the time of the initial cable construction, or if subsequently both go underground, cable must also be installed underground at no expense to the city, except to the extent the city bears the expenses of other parties similarly situated. If both electric and telephone utility wiring is aerial, the franchisee may install aerial cable, except where a property owner or resident requests underground installation, and property owner or resident agrees to bear the additional cost over aerial construction. 
(g)  The city shall give the franchisee reasonable notice of plans for street improvements when paving or resurfacing of a permanent nature is involved. Any relocation required by the city because of said improvements shall be at the expense of the franchisee. If all or part of a street within the city is closed or discontinued, the franchisee shall not be entitled to damages from the city due to the closing or discontinuance of such street, because of removal or relocation of lines or cables by the franchisee in said streets. 
(h)  All poles, lines, structures, and other facilities of the franchisee, in, on, over and under the streets, sidewalks, alleys, easements and other public grounds or places within the city shall be kept by the franchisee at all times in a safe, sound and substantial condition. 
(i)  The franchisee's work, while in progress, shall be properly protected at all times with suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares, or other devices to protect all members of the public having occasion to use the portion of the streets involved or adjacent property.

Sec. 5.3-31. - Franchise characteristics. 
(a)  A franchise authorizes use of the public rights-of-way for installing cables, wires, lines, optical fiber, and other facilities to operate a cable system within a specified area of the city, but does not expressly or implicitly authorize the franchisee to provide service to, or install cables, wires, lines, optical fiber, or any other equipment or facilities upon private property without owner consent (except for use of compatible easements pursuant to 47 U.S.C. §541(a)(2) or as otherwise provided by law), or to use publicly or privately owned utility poles or conduits without a separate agreement with the owners. 
(b)  A franchise is nonexclusive, and will not expressly or implicitly preclude the issuance of other franchises to operate cable systems within the city or affect the city's right to authorize use of public rights-of-way to other persons as it determines appropriate. 
(c)  Once a franchise agreement has been accepted and executed by the city and a franchisee, such franchise agreement shall constitute a contract between the franchisee and the city, and the terms, conditions and provisions of such franchise agreement, together with all duly enacted and applicable laws, ordinances, codes, rules, regulations and orders, shall define the rights and obligations of the franchisee and the city relating to the franchise, except as set forth in section 5.3-65(a). 
(Ord. No. 27, § 6, 11-28-00) 
Sec. 5.3-32. - Franchise subject to other laws. 
(a)  A franchisee is subject to, and must comply with, all generally applicable local, city, state and federal laws, ordinances, codes, rules, regulations, and orders. 
(b)  Except as may be specifically provided in this article or under the terms of a franchise agreement, the failure of the city, upon one or more occasions, to exercise a right, or to require compliance, or performance under the article or a franchise agreement shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of such right or waiver of compliance or performance in the future. 
(Ord. No. 27, § 7, 11-28-00) 
Sec. 5.3-33. - Interpretation of franchise terms. 
(a)  Subject to provisions of section 5.3-65, the provisions of this article will apply to a franchise agreement, and the express terms of this article will prevail over conflicting or inconsistent provisions in a franchise agreement, unless such franchise agreement expresses an explicit intent to waive a requirement of the article. 
(b)  The provisions of a franchise agreement will be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes and objectives consistent with this article and the public interest. Except where federal law or regulation in controlling, a franchise agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida. 
(Ord. No. 27, § 8, 11-28-00) 
Sec. 5.3-34. - Grant of franchises. 
(a)  The city may grant a franchise for a period not to exceed ten years, although a longer franchise term up to a 15-year term may be granted if the city council finds it would better meet community needs and interests. 
(b)  The city may make the grant of a franchise conditioned upon the completion of construction within a prescribed time or upon the performance of other specific obligations, which are to be set forth in the franchise agreement, specifying that failure to timely comply with the condition will cause the franchisee to be in material breach of its franchise agreement, and become subject to penalties pursuant to this article and the franchise agreement. Violations listed in section 5.3-59 shall be considered material breaches of this article. 
(c)  In evaluating an application for a new franchise, the city shall consider among other things, the following factors: the applicant's character, its technical, financial, and legal qualifications to construct and operate the proposed system; the nature of the proposed facilities, equipment and services; the applicant's record in other communities, if any; the economic impact on private property within the proposed service area; the capability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed system; potential disruption to existing users of the public rights-of-way and the public; and whether the proposal will meet reasonably anticipated community needs and serve the public interest. Where an applicant proposes an overbuild of an existing cable system, the city shall also consider, pursuant to F.S. § 166.046, the economic feasibility of multiple cable operators, the impact on the existing franchisee, including whether the operations of an existing cable franchisee will be interfered with or disrupted, and whether any adverse consequences to the public interest will result if the application is granted. 
(d)  The council shall hold a public hearing to consider any new application. Based upon the application, the testimony presented at the public hearing, any recommendations of the city manager, and any other information it deems relevant to the application, the council shall decide whether to grant or deny a franchise application and the terms and conditions of a grant. Any grant of a franchise shall be under terms and conditions that are not more favorable or less burdensome than those in an existing franchise. 
(e)  If the council grants an initial franchise application, the city manager and the applicant must agree on the terms of a franchise agreement within 90 calendar days from the date of the adoption of the resolution which approved the grant. This time period may be extended for good cause by the city. If agreement is not reached with the city within 90 calendar days or if the period is not extended by the city, the franchise grant will be null and void without further action by the city. 
(f)  After complying with the above requirements, the council, following a public hearing, and considering the testimony presented at the public hearing, any recommendations of the city manager, and any other relevant information, shall approve or disapprove the proposed franchise agreement by resolution. 
(g)  Subject to applicable federal law, the grant of an initial franchise, a renewed franchise, or of an application to modify a franchise, may be subject to a processing fee in an amount not to exceed the city's out-of-pocket costs in considering the application. If the processing fee is not paid within 60 days of the date of the council resolution approving the franchise agreement or a modification thereof, the franchisee will be subject to the penalties of this article and the franchise agreement. Prior to a franchise becoming effective, the approved applicant must demonstrate compliance with the surety, insurance and similar provisions of the franchise agreement.

Sec. 5.3-35. - Complaints. 
(a)  The franchisee shall maintain and operate its system and render efficient service in accordance with the rules and regulations which are or which may be set forth by the city from time to time in the exercise of its authority under applicable law, and subject to section 5.3-65(a) of this article. 
(b)  Whenever it is necessary to shut off or interrupt service for the making of repairs, installations, or adjustments, the franchisee shall do so at such times as will cause the least amount of inconvenience to its customers and unless such interruption is unforeseen and immediately necessary, it will give reasonable notice thereof to its customers. 
(c)  The franchisee shall maintain a local office which shall be open at reasonable hours for receiving complaints from subscribers and nonsubscribers. Said complaints shall be investigated and if attributable to the system, corrected within the time frames set forth in section 5.3-48 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 27, § 10, 11-28-00) 
Sec. 5.3-36. - Rates. 
(a)  Before any service is sold to any customer, a franchisee shall file with the city manager its schedule of rates for installation and monthly service charges, together with a statement of the rights and obligations of subscribers. 
(b)  Subsequent additions or amendments to rates, service charges and rights and obligations statements shall likewise be filed with the city manager at least 30 days before the same become effective. A franchisee shall also provide subscribers to the cable system with written notification of any such additions or amendments at least 30 days before the same become effective. 
(c)  In the event that any state or federal law or regulation is at any time after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, enacted, changed, modified, interpreted, amended, repealed or invalidated so as to allow for the city's regulation of rates paid by cable subscribers, the city may, at its option, regulate such rates as permitted by law. 
(d)  Rate regulation proceedings shall be conducted at a duly noticed public hearing to ensure that all interested parties have a reasonable opportunity to present their views. The board may conduct such hearings at its regularly scheduled meeting or at a meeting scheduled solely for the purpose of regulating rates. 
(e)  To the extent allowed by state and federal law, nothing in this section shall prevent a franchisee from applying a surcharge or late payment penalty to subscriber bills to reflect balances due the franchisee which are delinquent for 30 days or more. 
(Ord. No. 27, § 11, 11-28-00) 
Sec. 5.3-37. - Indemnification. 
    Prior to the beginning of any work by the franchisee within the prescribed limits of the city, the franchisee shall file with the city and shall keep in force and effect at all times during the effective period hereof, insurance certification evidencing a commercial general liability insurance policy, in the amount of $1,000,000.00 per occurrence, combined single limit, the terms and conditions whereof shall be such as to provide for the protection and indemnification of the city with respect to claims of any person or corporation suffering injury, loss or damage to person or property by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of its cable television system within the prescribed limits of the city. Both the city and the franchisee shall be named as insured and there shall be no right of subrogation against the city. Such insurance policy shall be subject to the acceptance and approval of the city. Any primary insurance policy must be issued by a company having a policy-holders' surplus at least five times the amount of the coverage of the policy, and the company must have management rating in Best's Insurance Guide of BB or better. Any excess policy used must be issued by underwriters acceptable to the city. Each such policy shall be in such minimum limits as are acceptable to the city, and said insurance coverage shall remain in full force and shall be undiminished during the effective period of this franchise. Every such insurance policy shall contain a provision whereby every franchisee executing the same shall obligate itself to notify the city in writing at least 30 days before any alteration, modification, or cancellation of such policy is to become effective, which would result in noncompliance with this provision. 
    A franchisee shall indemnify, save harmless and defend the city, and all its agents, officials and employees from any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action of every name and description brought against the city based on personal injury, bodily injury (including death) or property damages (including destruction) received or claimed to be received or sustained by any person or persons arising from or in connection with the franchisee's performance of its franchise agreement with the city. The franchisee shall defend the city in any action or proceeding commenced for the purpose of asserting any claim arising under a franchisee's performance of its franchise agreement, except for any claim asserted by a franchisee or asserted by the city against a franchisee. The city shall receive advance consent in writing before settling any dispute that is subject to indemnification by the franchisee. Nothing herein shall be construed as consent by an agency or subdivision of the State of Florida to be sued by third parties in any matter arising out of this article, or a franchise agreement; or as a waiver of sovereign immunity by any party to which sovereign immunity applies.

The franchisee will bear the cost of the preparation of such gross revenue report. 
(d)  Any payment of franchise fees to adjust for a shortfall in the quarterly payments for the preceding year must be made no later than the filing date for the annual gross revenue report. Adjustments for overpayments will be credited to subsequent quarterly payments. 
(e)  The city or its authorized representatives may inspect and audit any and all books and records of the franchisee relevant to the determination of gross revenue and the computation of franchise fees due, and recompute any amounts determined to be payable under the franchise. The cost of the audit will be borne by the franchisee if the payment to the city is increased by more than five percent for the period in question as a result of the audit. In the event that the city makes a claim for additional franchise fees as a result of the city's audit, the franchisee shall be given a reasonable period of time to review the results of the audit and challenge its results. 
(f)  In the event that a franchise payment is not received by the city on or before the due date, interest will be charged from the due date at a rate of 1.5 percent, calculated monthly, of the unpaid balance of the payment due quarterly, or part thereof, that the payment remains delinquent.

This provision shall not be deemed as a waiver of a franchisee's right to assert that the information sought by the city is proprietary and should not be disclosed, and to withhold such information upon the agreement of the city. If the city manager does not concur with such assertion, then the franchisee may appeal such decision to the city council in accordance with applicable laws and procedures. If the city council finds the books and records should be disclosed, and if the franchisee does not appeal such decision to a court of law, then the company shall promptly provide such documents, including the alleged proprietary portion thereof, to the city.

The security deposit shall be in the amount a franchise agreement specifies, taking into account the effects of inflation, and the extent of the franchisee's operations in the city. If the franchisee does not post the amount within 30 calendar days after the franchise agreement is signed, the entire security fund remaining may be forfeited if the city can prove damages, and/or such failure may be considered a material breach of this article and may be used as grounds for revocation of the franchise, consistent with the procedures set forth herein.

(4)  The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system. 
Prohibition of illicit connections: 
(1)  The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. 
(2)  This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
(3)  A person is considered to be in violation of this section if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(g)  Suspension of MS4 access. 
Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations: 
    The City of Orange City may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge: 
    Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this section may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency. 
(h)  Industrial or construction activity discharges. Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the City of Orange City prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(i)  Monitoring of discharges. 
1.  Applicability: This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
2.  Access to facilities: 
(1)  The public works department of the City of Orange City shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this section as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this section. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency. 
(2)  Facility operators shall allow the public works department of the City of Orange City ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
(3)  The public works department of the City of Orange City shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
(4)  The public works department of the City of Orange City has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the public works department of the City of Orange City and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
(6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the public works department of the City of Orange City access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this section. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this section. 
(7)  If the public works department of the City of Orange City has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this section, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this section or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(j)  Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices. The public works department of the City of Orange City will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(k)  Watercourse protection. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(l)  Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S. said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the public works department of the City of Orange City within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years. 
(m)  Enforcement. 
(1)  Notice of violation. Whenever the public works department of the City of Orange City finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this section, the authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation: 
a.  The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; 
b.  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 
c.  That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist; 
d.  The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; 
e.  Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and 
f.  The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. 
If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator. 
(n)  Appeal of notice of violation. Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the authorized enforcement agency. The notice of appeal must be received within 15 days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the special magistrate shall take place within 45 days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the special magistrate shall be final. 
(o)  Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within ten days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the authorized enforcement agency, then representatives of the authorized enforcement agency shall enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency or their designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. 
(p)  Cost of abatement of the violation. Within 15 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within ten days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become an assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall become liable to the city by reason of such violation. The liability shall be paid in not more than 12 equal payments. 
(q)  Injunctive relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this section. If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this section, the authorized enforcement agency may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation. 
(r)  Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this section, the authorized enforcement agency may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.

Sec. 7.5-5. - Impact fee schedule. 
(a)  The amount of the impact fee due will be determined by the impact fee schedule attached hereto as Exhibit A-Impact Fee Schedule, and by reference incorporated herein with full force and effect. The fees shown on the schedule are based on the factors explained in the Technical Report on Impact Fee Calculations for Fire and Rescue, Police Protection, and Parks and Recreation, available from the city clerk of the City of Orange City. The fees contained in the fee schedule reflect a discount of five percent from net cost to encourage use of this schedule in order to avoid the processing of independent fee calculation studies. 
(b)  If a development approval is requested for a development with mixed unit types, then the fee shall be computed by calculating the number of units of each type and multiplying the results by the appropriate fees on the schedule. 
(c)  When a question arises about which types on the schedule shall apply to the development, the development services director shall determine which comparable land use type shall apply, or, if there is no comparable land use, that a special study is required. 
(d)  The schedule shall be reviewed every two years to reflect new data and technical information that substantially affect the calculation of the proportionate fair share of capital costs represented by the schedule. 
(e)  The impact fee schedule for police, fire and park impact fees shall be as set by resolution.

The city council shall make its decision on the fee due under this section based on the following criteria: 
(1)  The fee represents a proportionate fair share of the costs of providing capital improvements whose need is created by new development; 
(2)  The calculation of the fee is based on appropriate methodologies for calculating the proportionate fair share considering any appropriate local factors; and 
(3)  The decision is compatible with and furthers the city comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 90-8-3, § 1, 9-12-90) 
Sec. 7.5-7. - Payment. 
    The feepayer shall pay the impact fee at the time the building permit issues at the building department, which shall record receipt in the official public record of the city, and, upon full payment of the fee, shall issue to the feepayer a certified copy of such record of receipt, which may be used by the feepayer as evidence of payment. 
(Ord. No. 90-8-3, § 1, 9-12-90) 
Sec. 7.5-8. - Credits. 
(a)  Any conveyance of land or construction received and accepted by the city council, as may be required by the city's development codes, from a feepayer for park and recreation, police or fire and rescue purposes shall be accepted in lieu of the appropriate impact fee due for that particular facility, if the conveyance or construction meets needs similar to the impact fee and is consistent with the city comprehensive plan. 
(b)  If the feepayer wishes to receive credit against the amount of the impact fee due for such conveyance or construction, the feepayer shall enter into a fee agreement with the city council as previously recommended by the city manager. The fee agreement shall provide for establishment of credits and payment of the fee in a specified manner and time.

(Ord. No. 228, § 5, 1-25-05) 
Sec. 7.5-35. - Imposition. 
(a)  Applicability of fee. 
(1)  Any person who makes or causes the making of an improvement to land which will generate additional traffic and which requires the issuance of a building permit, or any person who changes the use of any building to one which will generate additional traffic, shall be required to pay a thoroughfare road impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this section. 
(2)  No person shall undertake construction of an improvement for which the fee imposed by this article is applicable without having paid the proper thoroughfare road impact fee imposed by this article. No person shall change the use or allow a change in use of any building where the fee imposed by this article is applicable without having paid the proper thoroughfare road impact fee imposed by this article. 
(b)  Payment of fee required prior to issuance of certificate of occupancy, or use permit. No certificate of occupancy or use permit for which a complete application is submitted after the adoption of this article, for any activity requiring payment of an impact fee pursuant to this article shall be issued unless and until the thoroughfare road impact fee required by this article has been paid. The obligation of a person to pay the fee imposed by this article shall not be extinguished by the inadvertent failure of the city to collect the fee at the time required. 
(c)  Methods of determinination. The thoroughfare road impact fee for any development activity generating traffic in the city shall be determined either by using the method set forth in subsection (c)(1) below or by using the fee schedule provided for in subsection (c)(3) below. 
(1)  Independent calculation. Any person may determine their thoroughfare road impact fee by providing an independent traffic documentation that their impact on the thoroughfare system is less than the thoroughfare road impact fee as determined under subsection (c)(3) below. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the thoroughfare road impact fee has been calculated, which shall conform to the following factors: 
a.  The trip generation rate, trip length and the percent of new trips shall be documented together. In no event shall they be documented separately. All other variables in the thoroughfare road impact fee formula cannot be altered, but shall be based upon data current at the time this fee shall be due. Petitioners requesting to undertake an independent calculation may substitute the trip generation rate and the percent of new trips and trip length in the thoroughfare road impact fee formula with data obtained from approved traffic surveys and actual traffic counts generated by approved traffic study sites. The thoroughfare road impact fee formula is identified and explained in subsection (c)(2) below. 
b.  The unit of measure used for trip generation in the independent calculation must be identical to the one used in the thoroughfare road impact fee formula, in order to measure accurately the project's impact on the thoroughfare system. 
c.  If a single business or shopping center is studied, at least two sites within Volusia County must be tested. The results of each site must be added together and averaged to obtain an alternative trip generation rate, trip length and percent of new trips. The results can be substituted in the thoroughfare road impact fee formula. If the study results indicate a lower fee, the charges will be adjusted accordingly. 
d.  If no suitable alternative site is available as determined by the city staff, the applicant may pay the thoroughfare road impact fee, and employ a licensed engineer to conduct a traffic study on the project site within six months after the enterprise is open for business. The traffic study timeframe and monitoring points must be approved by the city staff. Only the trip generation rate, trip length and the percent of new trips can be used in the analysis. Once the results of each sampling point are added together and averaged they may be substituted in the thoroughfare road impact fee formula. The results will be used to determine an appropriate impact fee. If the traffic study results indicate a lower fee and accepted by the county staff, the difference will be refunded to the applicant. All refunds are subject to section 7.5-38. 
e.  This documentation shall be prepared and presented by licensed engineers. Specific actions such as the number of manual or automated counts, number of personal surveys, location of the sampling stations and the layout of the study sites will be negotiated by the applicant and county staff. 
(2)  Thoroughfare impact fee formula. The following formula shall be used to determine the impact fee per unit of development: 
Impact Fee=(1/2)*(TGR)*(%NT)*(DF)*(ATL)*(ACC)?WCL 
Where: TGR=trip generation rate assigned to each land use 
    NT=new trips generated by the land use 
    DF=distribution factor of trips utilizing the thoroughfare network 
    ATL=average trip length utilizing the thoroughfare network 
    ACC=average road construction cost 
    WCL=weighted capacity per lane mile 
(3)  Fee schedule. 
a.  The fee schedule for transportation impact fees shall be as set by resolution and shall be prepared based upon the formula presented in subsection (c)(2). 
b.  Credits for completed and accepted non-site-related improvements, as described in subsection (c)(1), shall be determined for each application, and shall be deducted from the thoroughfare road impact fees listed in the thoroughfare road impact fee schedule, at the time thoroughfare road impact fees are to be paid. The value of non-site-related improvements for which credits may be allowed shall be determined by development services director. 
c.  Credits for the present value of future gas or motor fuel tax payments utilized to fund capacity expansion of the thoroughfare road systems are included in the calculations of the fee schedule set out in this section. 
d.  The fees charged for a building with more than one use shall be for that use having the highest traffic generation rate except for church buildings with mixed uses or buildings with residential and non-residential mixed uses. If the church building has more than one use, the separate uses are to be identified and appropriately charged according to the fee schedule. If a building has residential and non-residential uses, the square footage of the building identified as residential will be charged based on the number of dwelling units, and then, the square footage identified as non-residential shall be charged for that use having the highest traffic generation rate. 
e.  If the type of development activity for which a building permit is applied is not specified on the fee schedule set out in this section, the city shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. The city shall be guided in the selection of a comparable type by the report titled "Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation: An Information Report" (sixth or any subsequent editions). If the city determines that there is no comparable type of land use on the fee schedule set out in this section, then the fee shall be determined by using traffic generation statistics contained in the report titled "Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation: An Information Report" (60 or any subsequent edition), average trip length and percent of new trips based upon the best data available to the county and by applying the formula set forth in subsection (1) of this subsection. 
f.  In the case of an expansion of an existing use on the same lot or an adjoining lot (which may be intersected by an easement or right-of-way) requiring the issuance of a building permit, the impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new as compared to the previous use. Provided, however, the impact fee shall be reduced by 50 percent from the amount of the fee that would otherwise be due and payable for an expansion to an existing use. The city shall be guided in this determination by the report titled "Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation: An Information Report" (sixth or any subsequent edition). 
g.  In the event the impact fee rate for a particular land use is changed subsequent to the issuance of a building permit and before the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the impact fee shall be the amount in effect on the date payment is received. Provided further, that an initial application for a site plan development order has been filed with the relevant local government on or before the adoption of the new fee schedule and provided that the project developer has applied for a building permit on or before the adoption of the new fee schedule, a project shall not be subject to the amended fee schedule. In the event the actions of other agencies preclude applying for a building permit by the adoption of the new fee schedule, the developer may present evidence to the development services director that the building permit application has been delayed through no fault of its own. 
h.  The thoroughfare road impact fee on a shopping center shall be computed using one retail-commercial rate for all stores except the out-parcels, which shall be calculated using the rate for that land use from the thoroughfare road impact fee schedule. 
i.  If an affidavit is filed by the owner of real property with the city certifying that a farm building on a farm is exempt from issuance of a building permit under Florida law, then the building shall also be exempt from impact fee charges. 
j.  Road construction and right-of-way credits issued by the development services director can be transferred between lots with identical land uses. 
k.  Thoroughfare road impact fees for private universities and colleges shall be based on the number of additional full-time equivalent ("FTE") students that any improvements to the school are designed to accommodate. The fee shall be based on 2.38 trips per FTE as indicated by the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual, Sixty Edition. Individual studies shall be utilized to demonstrate the average trip length for each proposed project, if the project results in an increase in the planned FTE student capacity. The college or university president shall certify that the project shall not increase said FTE's.

(1)  Interest at the rate set by law for judgments shall be due on all fees due under this article from the time such fee was due according to the terms of subsection (a) of this section. The inclusion in this article of provisions concerning interest due shall be deemed to be cumulative of the city's rights already existing as a matter of law to prejudgment interest upon sums which are certain and due and payable at a specific time. Accordingly, the requirement for the payment of interest shall be deemed to apply retroactively to all fees which have previously become due under the terms of this article; and nothing in this article shall be construed in derogation of such right otherwise existing at law. 
(2)  There shall be due and payable to the city an administrative penalty of five percent per month to a maximum of 25 percent of all fees unpaid at the time they were due according to the terms of this article. Such administrative penalty shall accrue monthly on the anniversary of the date when such fee should have been paid. In the case of fees previously due under the terms of this article, such penalty shall accrue at the rate of five percent per month to a maximum of 25 percent with the first monthly penalty accruing one month following the effective date of the ordinance. 
(3)  The city attorney or a duly authorized representative may execute, serve upon the owner by certified mail and record a notice of nonpayment in the official records of Volusia County, which shall contain the legal description of the property and the amount of the impact fee liability. Said notice shall thereupon operate as a lien against such property for the amount of the impact fee, together with interest, penalties, and the costs and fees for collection, coequal with the lien of all state, county, district and municipal taxes.

ARTICLE III. - BINGO 

Sec. 10-51. - Title. 
    This article shall be cited as the "Orange City Bingo Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 98-01-01, § 1, 2-10-98) 
Sec. 10-52. - Legislative findings. 
    Based on evidence and testimony presented at the public hearing before the city council on January 27, 1998, the evidence provided by the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation of the Ninth Judicial Circuit in Florida, and the findings incorporated in Hernando County Ordinance 93-18, Section 1, and Pasco County Ordinance 92-15, Section 1, and Lake County Ordinance No. 94-4, Section 1, the City Council of the City of Orange City finds and determines that: 
(1)  F.S. § 849.0931, was enacted by the state legislature as an exception to the gambling and lottery laws. It authorizes charitable, nonprofit and veterans' organizations engaged in charitable, civic, community, benevolent, religious or scholastic works and other similar activities to conduct bingo games provided the entire proceeds derived from the conduct of the bingo games, less actual business expenses for articles designed for and essential to the operation, conduct, and playing of bingo, are donated to such endeavors. 
(2)  F.S. § 949.0931(2)(a), prohibits the net proceeds from bingo games from being used for any purpose other than charitable, nonprofit and veterans' organizations engaged in charitable, civic, community, benevolent, religious or scholastic works and other similar activities. 
(3)  F.S. § 849.0931(2)(b), provides that it is the express intent of the legislature that no charitable, nonprofit or veterans' organization serve as a sponsor of a bingo game conducted by another, but such organization may only be directly involved in the conduct of such a game as provided in the statute. 
(4)  F.S. § 849.0931, contains various other provisions intended to assure that only the groups, associations, and organizations authorized by the statute are involved in the operating of, or receive and/or distribute the proceeds of bingo games, but the present law is inadequate to fully achieve this objective because of a lack of regulatory authority as suggested by the Twelfth Statewide Grand Jury. 
(5)  F.S. § 849.0931, contains various other provisions intended to assure that the primary benefactor of the authorized bingo games is actually the charitable, nonprofit and veterans' organizations, and not private persons, but the present law has proved inadequate to fully achieve that objective. 
(6)  Investigations by law enforcement agencies in Orange City and other Florida jurisdictions have demonstrated that a high degree of commercialization existed in bingo halls where bingo games were conducted seven days a week and that the bingo halls operated, in effect, as mini-casinos where only a small amount of the proceeds of the bingo games were eventually distributed for charitable purposes. Those investigations revealed that in those commercial bingo halls the particular charitable organizations whose names were used as the alleged operators of the bingo games did not actually control the conduct of their own bingo games in an "arms-length" relationship with the commercial operator. It was discovered, rather, that the commercial operator usually controlled the games through paid employees that were "enrolled" in the charity whose names were being used as supposed "volunteers." 
(7)  Law enforcement investigations in Orange City and other jurisdictions revealed that the commercial operators controlled all the monies and proceeds of the bingo games and only forwarded very small percentages of the proceeds to the charitable organizations. Repeated instances were uncovered of monies and proceeds from bingo games being retained or used illegally or being diverted from the authorized charitable operator deducting extremely high rental rates from the proceeds to the charitable organizations or the commercial operator deducting a variety of "expenses" from the charitable proceeds for services allegedly performed by the commercial operator. 
(8)  The arrangements between and among lessors of places where bingo games are conducted, actual or putative nonprofit organizations whose names are used, and concessionaires at such games have become commercialized to an extent not contemplated or intended by the legislature. This defeats the legislative goal of reserving bingo as an activity permitted only for recreation and charitable fund raising rather than as a private venture for profit. 
(9)  The commercialization of bingo and the resulting diversion of bingo proceeds to private persons and commercial operators results in a reduction of bingo proceeds which are actually donated to benefit the charitable, civic, community, benevolent, religious or scholastic works and other similar activities in the community. 
(10)  The Twelfth Statewide Grand Jury reported in October of 1995 after investigating the bingo industry that effective enforcement of the laws regarding bingo games can only be brought about by local regulation of these games to ensure that the proceeds from the games pass into the hands of the groups, organizations or associations identified in F.S. § 849.0931, in the manner and for the purposes set forth in the statute. The Twelfth Statewide Grand Jury has recommended that use of any location for bingo be limited to two days a week and that all bingo proceeds be deposited in separate accounts from which all prizes and expenses are paid. 
(11)  F.S. § 849.0931, does not contain any language preempting a local government from adopting regulations relating to the conduct of bingo games. 
(12)  Orange City, a Charter City, possesses the power pursuant to Article VIII, Section 1g, Florida Constitution, and F.S. § 166.021, to exercise its police power to promote the health, safety and welfare of the people of Orange City. 
(13)  Orange City has a large population, some of whom play bingo, and many nonprofit, charitable and veterans organizations which rely on legally obtained bingo proceeds. 
(14)  A need exists in Orange City to provide for local regulation of bingo. 
(Ord. No. 98-01-01, § 2, 2-10-98) 
Sec. 10-53. - Legislative intent.

(b)  It is the intent of the council that this article be supplementary to F.S. § 849.0931, as it may be amended, and that any conflict be resolved in favor of the statute. 
(c)  It is the intent of the council that any violation of F.S. § 849.0931, result in the penalties as set forth in F.S. § 849.0931(13), as it may be amended, but not exclusively.

A retailer who sells sparklers at more than one retail location may submit one permit application for all locations within the city by providing the address of each location on the same permit application form, or the retailer may submit multiple application forms for each location. Nothing herein shall be construed to exempt manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, retailers or seasonable retailers, from compliance with all other applicable zoning, licensing, building and fire protection requirements of the City Code of Ordinances and the land development regulation code. It is unlawful to sell sparklers in the city without a permit.

ARTICLE VII. - RESIDENCES OF SEXUAL OFFENDERS 

Sec. 10-131. - Legislative findings and intent. 
(a)  The findings set forth in the recitals (whereas clauses) to this article are hereby adopted as additional legislative findings. 
(b)  The city council of the City of Orange City hereby adopts the provisions of F.S. § 775.21(3)(a), which state as follows: 
"Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant." 
(c)  The city council hereby adopts the provisions of F.S. § 947.1405(7), which provides, in pertinent part, that: 
"It is the finding of the Legislature that the population of offenders released from state prison into the community who meet the conditional release criteria poses the greatest threat to the public safety of the groups of offenders under community supervision. Therefore, the Department of Corrections is to provide intensive supervision by experienced correctional probation officers to conditional release offenders." 
(d)  The city council hereby finds and determines that repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant and a drain on the resources of society. 
(e)  It is the intent of this article to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety, morals and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residences. 
(f)  It is the desire of the city council that the Volusia County School District carefully adhere to the provisions of F.S. § 947.1405(7), which relates to the requirement that school bus stops be located at least 1,000 feet of the persons who are the subject of this article.

After bid opening, corrections in bids shall not be permitted. No changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the city or fair competition shall be permitted. In lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw his bid at the discretion of the city if: 
(1)  The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document; or 
(2)  The evidence of the mistake submitted by the bidder shall be substantial and convincing. 
All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids, or to cancel awards or contracts based on bid mistakes shall be supported by a written determination made by the purchasing agent. 
(f)  Award. After approval by the city council if over $25,000.00, or the city manager if $25,000.00 or under, the contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by appropriate written notice to the lowest, responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. In the event the low responsive and responsible bid for a construction project exceeds the architectural or engineering estimate, the city council or city manager if sealed bid price is $25,000.00 or under may negotiate an adjustment of the bid price with the low responsive and responsible bidder in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds, provided that time or economic considerations preclude resolicitation of work of a reduced scope. 
(g)  Multistep sealed bidding. When it is considered impractical to prepare a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers, to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been determined to be technically acceptable under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation. 
(h)  Use of bids obtained by other governmental agencies. The city may utilize a competitive bid solicited by any other municipal, county, or state or federal governmental agency, or any combination of such agencies, in purchasing items requiring competitive sealed bids.

If fewer than three firms desire to perform the services, the committee shall recommend such firms as it determines to be qualified. 
(8)  If the committee receives more than one proposal for the same engagement the committee may rank, in order of preference, the firms to perform the engagement. The firm ranked first may then negotiate a contract with the committee giving, among other things, a basis of its proposed fee for that engagement. If the committee is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with that firm, negotiations with that firm shall be formally terminated, and the committee shall then undertake negotiations with the second-ranked firm. Failing accord with the second-ranked firm, negotiations shall then be terminated with that firm and undertaken with the third-ranked firm.

Water service shall not be restored until such unauthorized connections have been removed and until settlement is made in full for all water service estimated by the city to have been used by reason of such unauthorized connection. If a water customer disconnects the previously active city water connection and replaces the same with another source, such shall be an unauthorized connection, shall constitute a code violation, and shall also be considered a cross connection as shown in subsection (b)7, and shall be remedied as soon as possible to protect the integrity and potable quality of the water system. 
(d)  Authority to inspect. 
(1)  The Orange City Utilities manager, or his designated agent, may inspect the plumbing in every building or premises in this water system as frequently as in his judgment may be necessary to ensure that such plumbing has been installed in such a manner as to prevent the possibility of pollution of the water supply system by the plumbing. The manager shall notify or cause to be notified in writing the owner or authorized agent of the owner of any such building or premises, to correct, within a reasonable time set by the manager, any plumbing installed or existing contrary to or in violation of this section and which, in his judgment, may therefore permit the pollution of the water system or otherwise adversely affect the public health. An inspection fee shall be charged for each inspection as set forth by resolution. 
(2)  The customer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of Orange City Utilities to determine whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of this section, exist. 
(e)  General policy. 
(1)  No plumbing fixture, water service connection device or construction shall be installed or maintained or shall be connected to the water system, when such installation or connection may provide a possibility of polluting such water supply or may provide a cross connection between a distributing system of water for drinking and domestic purposes and water which may become contaminated by such plumbing fixture, water service connection device or construction unless there is provided an approved backflow prevention device. 
(2)  An approved backflow prevention device shall also be installed, at the owner's expense, on each service line to a customer's water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served; but, in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line, wherever the following conditions exist: 
a.  In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be of a safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable as an additional source by Orange City Utilities, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard. 
b.  In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system which have been subject to deterioration in quality. 
c.  In the case of premises having one internal cross connection that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or two intricate plumbing and piping arrangements, or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line. 
(3)  The type of protective device required shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows: 
a.  In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. 
b.  In the case of any premises where there is water or a substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly. 
c.  In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. 
d.  In the case of any premises where there are uncontrolled cross connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device at the service connection. 
(4)  Any backflow prevention device required herein shall be of a model and size approved by Orange City Utilities. The term "approved backflow prevention device" means that the device has been manufactured in full conformance with standards established by the American Water Works Association entitled: "AWWA C506-69, Standards for Reduced Pressure Principle and Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Devices," and have met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research of the University of Southern California. 
(5)  It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where backflow prevention devices are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per year. In those instances where the manager deems that hazard to be great enough he may require certified inspections at more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by Orange City Utilities certified personnel. It shall be the duty of the manager to see that these timely tests are made. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever said devices are found to be defective. Records of such repairs and overhauls shall be kept and made available to Orange City Utilities. 
(6)  All presently installed backflow prevention devices which do not meet the requirements of this section, but were approved devices for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and which have been maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance, be excluded from the requirements of this section so long as Orange City Utilities is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the Orange City Utilities water system. Whenever the existing device is moved from the present location or requires more than minimum maintenance or when Orange City Utilities finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by a backflow prevention device meeting the requirements of this section. 
(f)  Manual of cross connection control. The city adopts by reference the Orange City Utilities' Manual of Cross Connection Control. Compliance with the manual and this section is required. Copies of the Manual of Cross Connection Control may be obtained from Orange City Utilities. 
(g)  City's right to refuse service for noncompliance. 
(1)  The city shall refuse to supply water service to any customer or structure which does not comply with the requirements of this section. 
(2)  Service of water to any premises shall be disconnected by Orange City Utilities if a backflow prevention device required by law, rules or regulations is not installed, tested and maintained; or if it is found that a backflow prevention device has been removed or bypassed, or if unprotected cross connections exist on the premises and there is inadequate backflow protection at the service connection. Water service shall not be restored until such condition or defects are corrected and all payments for penalties, if any, have been made. All turn off and turn on service charges shall be paid by the customer. 
(h)  Penalty for violation. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section or failing to comply therewith shall be punished by a fine of up to and not to exceed $500.00 or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding 60 days or by both such fine and imprisonment at the discretion of the judge trying the case. Each day any such violation shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.

Sec. 17.3-134. - General policy regarding establishment of rates and charges. 
    The city owns, operates and maintains wastewater collection and transmission systems which serve residents within the city and the county. The city is provided treatment and disposal services on a wholesale basis by the county. New development may require the extension of mains to provide service, as well as modification or expansion of existing facilities or plants to accommodate new development. In some instances, the city, in anticipation of expansion of its systems due to growth and development, has already provided mains for service thereof. The cost of providing extensions, modifications, and expansions of facilities is to be borne by property owners, builders or developers within the city's service area to defray or partially defray the costs of these extensions, modifications, and expansions. The allocable share of each is to be charged as described herein. It is the declared policy of the city by this article to establish a uniform method to determine charges for availability of services so that all such contributions shall be nondiscriminatory among the various customers served by the city's system and shall be applied as nearly as possible with uniformity to all customers and prospective customers within the city's service area. The city specifically reserves its rights to fix and determine rates, charges and contributions required for the provision, consumption, operation, maintenance, extension, and expansion of its utility services as provided herein and as authorized by law. Each customer is hereby notified that the city, in the exercise of its governmental responsibility to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of all customers of its utility services, has the authority and responsibility to amend its schedules of rates, charges, and contributions from time to time to ensure the perpetuation of service.

CHAPTER 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Section 1.1. - Title. 
    This appendix shall be entitled the "Land Development Code of the City of Orange City, Florida," otherwise known as the "code." 
Section 1.2. - Authority. 
    This code is enacted pursuant to the requirements and authority of F.S. § 163.3161 et seq. (the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act), the City Charter and the general powers in F.S. ch. 166 (city government). 
Section 1.3. - Purpose and intent. 
    The city has developed this unified code to implement the city comprehensive plan and to establish a thorough and efficient development review process. This code sets forth regulations, requirements and procedures governing the use and development of land for the purpose of protecting the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of Orange City and to enhance the appearance, function and livability of the city, to the end of improving the overall quality of life within the community. As required by F.S. § 163.3202, this code contains specific and detailed provisions that regulate the subdivision of land; the use of land and water; areas subject to flooding; environmentally sensitive lands; signage; stormwater management and protection of potable water well fields. This code also requires that all development be reviewed for its impact on public facilities and services, and that adopted levels-of-service are maintained. 
(Ord. No. 210, Exh. A, 8-24-04) 
Section 1.4. - Comprehensive plan consistency. 
    This code incorporates new authorizations, requirements and regulations to implement the objectives and policies of the city's comprehensive plan, and to ensure that all land development activities within the city are consistent with and further the goals, objectives, policies, land uses, densities and intensities in the comprehensive plan. It is recognized, however, that situations may arise in the daily administration and enforcement of this code whereby strict interpretation and enforcement of the code may be contrary to the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan. Such situations may arise due to changes in land development priorities or economics, new issues that were not anticipated at the time this code was drafted and adopted, or the inability to meet competing goals through a single action. In these situations, the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan shall take precedence, and the code shall be interpreted and administered consistent with the overall goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan until such time that the code and/or comprehensive plan can be amended to resolve any conflict. 
Section 1.5. - Jurisdiction. 
    The provisions of this code shall apply to all development of land within the corporate limits of the City of Orange City, Florida, as now or hereafter defined, and all areas under the jurisdiction of the city for land use planning and development control as specified in any applicable comprehensive plan, goals, objectives, policy or interlocal planning agreements. 
Section 1.6. - General interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and administration of this code, all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, interpreted consistent with the intent of this code and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under Florida Statutes. 
Section 1.7. - Exercise or delegation of authority. 
    Whenever a provision appears requiring the head of a department or some other city officer or employee to perform an act or duty, it is to be construed to authorize the performance of such act or duty by any supervisor within the chain of command of such officer or employee as well as delegation to subordinates of such officer or employee to perform the required act or duty, unless the terms of the provision or section specify otherwise, or such performance or delegation would be contrary to the spirit and intent of this code. 
Section 1.8. - Private restrictions. 
    It is not intended by the provisions of this code to repeal, abrogate, annual or in any way impair or interfere with private restrictions placed upon property by deed, covenant or private agreement, except that where this code imposes higher standards than imposed by such deeds, covenants, or private agreements, the provisions of this code shall apply. The city shall not be responsible for enforcement of said deeds, covenants or agreements. 
(Ord. No. 210, Exh. A, 8-24-04) 
Section 1.9. - Relationship of specific to general provisions. 
    More specific provisions of this code shall be followed in lieu of more general provisions, which may be more lenient than, or in conflict with the more specific provision. 
Section 1.10. - Effects of conflicting provisions. 
    Except for the provisions of section 1.4 in the case of conflict within this code or if any provision of this code is in conflict with a provision of any other city code, ordinance, resolution or regulation then the most restrictive shall apply. 
Section 1.11. - Severability. 
    If any part of this code is for any reason held or declared to be unconstitutional, inoperative or void, such holdings of invalidity shall not affect the remaining portions of this code; and it shall be construed to have been the legislative intent to pass this code without such unconstitutional, invalid or inoperative part therein; and the remainder of this code after the exclusion of such part shall be deemed to be held valid as if such part had not been included therein. Also, if this code or any of the provisions thereof shall be held inapplicable to any person, property or circumstance, such holdings shall not affect the applicability thereof to any other person, property or circumstance. 
Section 1.12. - Repeal of conflicting ordinances.

D.  The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure. 
E.  The grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the code and that such variance will not be injurious to the area involved.

3.6.3.  Conditions and safeguards. The planning commission may impose on the grant of a variance any conditions or safeguards not otherwise required, if deemed necessary or desirable in furthering the purposes of this code. Violation of any such conditions or safeguards may result in a revocation of any variance permit, in addition to any other remedy for such violation provided in this code or by law.

If the conditional use does not demonstrate compliance as provided herein, the conditional use shall expire. 
B.  If a conditional use does not begin to serve the purpose for which it was granted within 12 months from the date of rendition, or if its use is abandoned for 12 consecutive months, or if the property or business enjoying the conditional use is either transferred or sold, then the conditional use shall expire. 
C.  The planning commission may establish a shorter or longer period of time for a conditional use to commence, comply, or expire, including phased compliance, as a condition of approval.

A request for extension must be made in writing prior to the expiration date. 
E.  In addition to all remedies provided in Chapter 2, Article IV of the City's Code of Ordinances, failure to maintain a conditional use in compliance with the planning commission recommendation and associated conditional use concept plans or final site plans shall be grounds for revocation of the conditional use, subject to enforcement procedures and an enforcement proceeding before the code enforcement hearing officer.

Section 4.6. - Improvements, renovations and repair. 
    Improvements, renovations and repair to existing structures shall only effect facility capacity and concurrency to the extent such improvements, renovations, and repairs increase the number of dwelling units, floor area for nonresidential uses or other measures of intensity. In such cases where improvements, renovations, repair and reuse to existing structures will result in a probable increase in either density or intensity of the property or development, then a determination of such an increase and its effect on facility capacity shall be made prior to any approval for a development permit. If existing facility capacity is available and no degradation of adopted service levels for those facilities identified in section 4.2.1 of this chapter will result from such an improvement, a development permit may be issued. If such improvements, renovations and repairs will not result in any increase in density or intensity, then the issue of sufficient facility capacity and concurrency will have no bearing on the issuance of a development permit. 
Section 4.7. - Modifications, amendments or additions. 
    Modifications, amendments or additions to the approvals specified under this chapter during the planning period that would result in an increase in density or intensity in the properties shall be tested for facility capacity for the additional density or intensity identified. 
Section 4.8. - Concurrency review process. 
    The development services department shall be responsible for conducting all concurrency reviews as required by this chapter. Concurrency review shall be initiated upon receipt of a completed concurrency review form provided by the development services department and accompanied by a concurrency review fee as adopted by resolution of the city council. The department may also conduct concurrency reviews for developments in the preapplication or sketch plan stage, and issue a nonbinding letter of concurrency findings. Such requests for concurrency review shall require the submission of a concurrency review fee as established by resolution of the city council. 
4.8.1.  Application. All development applications unless exempted by sections 4.2.2 and/or 4.2.3 of this chapter shall include a completed concurrency review form that is completed by the applicant and containing the following information: 
A.  Traffic impact study. Unless exempted by section 4.2.2. and/or 4.2.3. of this code, all new developments shall be required to submit a traffic analysis, which identifies the development's impact on the city's transportation system. The development services department may also require the submission of a traffic analysis for developments whose site location, anticipated total trip generation, circulation patterns or other such factors warrant a more extensive review of traffic impacts. Such an analysis shall include the following: 
1.  Total projected average daily trip ends for the proposed development. [2] 
2.  Average projected peak-hour trip ends generated by the development. [3] 
3.  Design capacity of the accessed road. 
4.  Analysis of traffic distribution on the road network including all links impacted by more than 500 trips per day. 
5.  Projected percentage of truck and bus traffic. 
6.  Necessary operational improvements to the city's transportation system in order to maintain the appropriate level-of-service for the roadway. 
7.  Other related information as required by the DSD. 
B.  Description and estimate of water use needs. 
C.  Description and estimate of wastewater generation. 
D.  Description and estimate of solid waste generation. 
E.  Stormwater drainage calculations. 
F.  Other information required by the DSD to conduct a complete and accurate review. 
Review and approval of a proposed development may be postponed for a reasonable time period in order for required information to be assembled. Failure of the applicant to provide adequate information on the anticipated project impacts in a timely fashion, however, shall constitute sufficient grounds to deny the project. 
4.8.2.  Project impact assessment. 
A.  Existing conditions. To conduct the assessment of the anticipated impacts of a proposed development on public facilities, the applicant shall use the development services department's inventory of public facilities capacities as a base for the establishment of existing conditions. 
B.  Impact assessment. Using the information provided as required by section 4.8.1.A. through F., the applicant shall calculate the anticipated impacts of the proposed development for all applicable public facilities. The impacts of the proposed development shall then be assessed against the existing conditions established above. 
4.8.3.  Determination of availability. In determining the availability of public facilities or services, a developer may propose, and the city may approve, developments in stages or phases so that public facilities and services needed for each phase will be available in accordance with the standards required by Sections 9J-5.0055(2)(a), (2)(b) and (2)(c), F.A.C. 
Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Note- The latest edition of the institute of traffic engineers (ITE) trip generation manual shall be used to calculate these estimates. Adjustments to these estimates may be made, based on special trip generation information supplied by the applicant. 

--- (3) --- 
Note- The latest edition of the institute of traffic engineers (ITE) trip generation manual shall be used to calculate these estimates. Adjustments to these estimates may be made, based on special trip generation information supplied by the applicant. 

Section 4.9. - Concurrency findings. 
    Upon the conclusion of the concurrency review, the DSD shall prepare a written set of findings, as appropriate, concerning the proposed development. These findings shall include, but are not limited to: 
A.  The anticipated public facility impacts of the proposed development; 
B.  The ability of existing facilities to accommodate the proposed development at the adopted level of service standards; 
C.  Any existing facility deficiencies that will need to be corrected prior to the completion of the proposed development; 
D.  The facility improvement or additions necessary to accommodate the impacts of the proposed development at the adopted level of service standard and the entity responsible for the design and installation of all required facility improvements or additions; 
E.  The date such facility improvement or additions will need to be completed to be concurrent with the impacts on such facility created by the proposed development. 
Section 4.10. - Concurrency reservation. 
4.10.1.  Capacity reservation. If the concurrency findings in section 4.9 reveal that the capacity of public facilities is equal to or greater than that required to maintain the adopted level-of-service for said facilities, the DSD shall reserve public facility capacity necessary for the proposed development. Capacity reservations shall be made on a first-come, first-served basis, based on the date of project approval. Concurrency shall be reserved in conjunction with a development order and shall be valid only for the specific land used, densities, intensities, and construction and improvements contained in the development order and any applicable development agreements approved for the development. A finding of concurrency shall reserve public facility capacity for the length of the development order. If the development order expires, the capacity reservation will expire on the same expiration date of the development order. For planned unit development, public facility capacity may be reserved for the first phase of the project for up to one year from the date of approval of the development agreement. Properties with approvals specified under this section shall have facility capacity reserved for such properties during the duration of the planning period unless previous agreements provide for an earlier expiration date. Capacity reservations for concurrency shall expire if the underlying developments order or development agreement expires or is revoked. 
4.10.2.  Project deferral/development moratoriums. If at any time the city's inventory of public facilities capacities indicates that a public facility has dropped below it's adopted level service, then the city shall cease to issue development orders for projects that would impact the deficient facility. Such a suspension or moratorium on the issuance of development orders shall continue until such time as the adopted LOS standard is reestablished or the comprehensive plan is amended to reflect a lower, acceptable community standard for the facility in question. However, the city may allow an applicant to proceed with the project not withstanding a failure of the development due to satisfying transportation concurrency provided the provisions of F.S. § 163.3180(11) can be met. 
4.10.3.  Concurrency denials. In the event that the concurrency review reveals that the proposed development would generate public facility impacts beyond that which can be absorbed by available capacity, the city shall ensure that there is a financial or other legally binding commitment to ensure that public facilities necessary to correct the anticipated deficiency will be in place concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development. Should the city and/or a developer be unable to provide such assurances, the project shall be denied. Projects denied due to failures to meet requirements, but for which all other land development requirements have been met, shall be placed on a prioritization list for approval of development orders once facility improvements have been made. 
4.10.4.  Deferrals and denials related to traffic LOS. For deferrals or denials related to traffic LOS, the city may allow an applicant to proceed with the project not withstanding a failure of the development due to satisfying transportation concurrency provided the provisions of F.S. § 163.3180(11) can be met. 
CHAPTER 5. - DEVELOPMENT ORDERS, DEVELOPMENT PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY 

Section 5.1. - Issuance of development orders and development permits. 
    No person shall undertake the development of land within the corporate limits of the City of Orange City except pursuant to a valid development permit issued as required by this code unless specifically exempted as provided by this code. A development permit may not be issued unless authorized by a development order that meets the requirements of this code and said permit meets any other applicable requirements. A development order for a proposed development shall be issued only in conjunction with the approval of either a site plan or a preliminary subdivision plat wherein the applicant will install all subdivision improvements in the manner prescribed by this code prior to final subdivision plat approval. If the subdivision improvements are not installed prior to final subdivision plat approval, then the development order shall be issued only in conjunction with the approval and recording of the final subdivision plat. The issuance of a development order shall authorize issuance of appropriate development permits that meet the regulation of this code and any other application of requirements. An approved tree removal and/or approved stormwater development permit, upon issuance, shall authorize commencement of site work. 
Section 5.1.1. - Performance and maintenance guarantees. 
    As a condition for the issuance of any development order, either in conjunction with a site plan and/or subdivision plat, the applicant shall provide the city with a guarantee of performance of the development order relating to infrastructure. 
A.  In lieu of installing required improvements prior to the approval of a final plat, or the issuance of a certificate of occupancy (or its functional equivalent), a developer may guarantee installation of improvements by providing performance bond, escrow, or irrevocable letter of credit, in an agreement form approved by the city attorney. Such surety shall cover at least 110 percent of the cost of all required improvements such as streets, utilities, drainage structures, landscaping, or others as required by the land development code, with estimates provided by the developer and approved by the city engineer. The surety shall be conditioned upon faithful performance by the developer of the work required to be complete all improvements in the development, in compliance with these regulations, and shall be payable to and for the indemnification of the city. Portions of the guarantee may be released to the developer proportionate to the work completed from time to time as work progresses. The amount to be released shall be determined by the city engineer. Upon approval of all required improvements by the city engineer, the city council shall accept any improvements to be publicly dedicated and a maintenance guarantee shall be established as set forth in this section. 
B.  Following the dedication of the required improvements, the city shall provide routine maintenance. However, the developer shall continue to be responsible for the repair, reconstruction and/or replacement of all improvements due to defects in design, materials and/or workmanship for a period of one year after dedication to the city. This guarantee shall be in the amount of 15 percent of the construction cost of the improvements as provided by the engineer of record and approved by the city engineer. Should the city engineer find defects in design, material and/or workmanship during the maintenance period as herein specified, the city engineer shall notify the developer in writing, giving the developer 15 days to take corrective action. Should the developer fail to take corrective action within 15 days, the city may correct the problem, deducting the cost from the maintenance guarantee. At the end of the maintenance guarantee period, if all requested repairs, reconstruction and/or replacement of improvements have been completed to the satisfaction of the city engineer, the city council shall release the developer and surety from any further obligation under the terms of the maintenance guarantee.

CHAPTER 6. - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 

Section 6.1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to assist implementation of the city's comprehensive plan authorized by F.S. ch. 163 by establishing procedures and standards for the subdivision and development of land within the city. These regulations are intended to aid in the coordination of land development in accordance with orderly physical patterns; to discourage haphazard, premature, uneconomic or scattered land development; to encourage development of economically stable and healthful communities; to ensure proper identification, monumentation and recording of real estate boundaries; to ensure to the purchaser of land in a subdivision that adequate and necessary physical improvements of lasting quality will be installed by the developer and ensure that citizens and taxpayers will not bear this cost; to provide for safe and convenient traffic circulation; to provide an efficient, adequate and economic supply of utilities and services to new land developments; to prevent periodic or seasonal flooding through flood control measures and drainage facilities; to provide public open spaces in new land developments through the dedication or reservation of land for recreational, educational and other public purposes; to help conserve and protect physical, economic and scenic resources; to promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. 
Section 6.2. - Applicability. 
    This chapter shall apply to any division of land as follows: 
A.  No lot shall be sold, no subdivision shall be platted or recorded, and no development permit shall be issued unless the subdivision meets all the applicable laws of the state and has been approved or determined exempt in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. 
B.  The requirements of this chapter shall not apply to any land forming part of a subdivision created and recorded prior to effective date of this code, but it shall apply to any re-subdividing of previously recorded subdivisions and any new subdivisions. 
C.  Developments that have received preliminary plat approval prior to the effective date of this code and are recorded within 180 days following the effective date of this code shall not be bound by the requirements of this chapter. 
D.  When a parcel of land has been subdivided and a plat thereof submitted bearing the dedication executed by the developers and mortgagors having a recorded interest in the land subdivided, and the approval of the city has been secured and recorded, all streets, alleys, easements, rights-of-way and public areas shown on such plat, unless otherwise stated, shall be deemed to have been dedicated to the public for the uses and purposes stated. However, nothing herein shall be construed as creating an obligation upon the city council to perform any act of construction or maintenance within such dedicated areas except where the city council accepts said dedication in writing and where the obligation is voluntarily assumed. 
Section 6.3. - Exemptions. 
    The DSD shall review and determine if the following divisions of land are exempt from the approval processes and platting requirements of this chapter. If the DSD determines that said subdivision is exempt the applicant shall provide a survey or metes and bounds description of the exempt lots to the Volusia County Appraiser's Office and a copy to the DSD. 
A.  The division of any land into a parcel greater than five acres where no new street right-of-way is proposed or required and the parcels front on an existing dedicated public paved street. 
B.  The combination or recombination of previously platted lots or portions of lots where the overall number of lots is not increased, all of the resultant lots meet or exceed the dimensional lot standards of chapter 8 of this code, front on a public paved road and are served by public water and sewer.

4.  Effect of TRC approval. Upon approval of a minor subdivision application, the city clerk shall transmit a copy of the approved minor subdivision to the county property appraisers office and retain a copy as a part of the official city record. 
6.4.3.  Major subdivisions. Major subdivisions as defined by this code shall be subject to the following requirements: 
A.  Preliminary plat. Submission and approval of a preliminary plat and construction plan shall be a prerequisite to the development of a major subdivision. The preliminary plat shall be submitted before the final plat and shall include the overall preliminary design for the entire area that is proposed to be subdivided. However, the DSD may authorize on a case-by-case basis, the submittal of a preliminary plat and final plat application for consideration for approval at the same time or the submission of a final plat application for approval without a preliminary plat application. 
1.  Application. Application for preliminary plat approval shall be made to the DSD using the application form provided by the development services department for that purpose. The application shall be accompanied by the preliminary plat application review fee as adopted by resolution of the city council and the appropriate number of proposed plans as determined by the development services department. All plans shall be signed and sealed by the project's registered engineer. Preliminary plat applications shall include all required information and exhibits, all applicable standards and specifications of the City of Orange City Design Standards Manual, the City of Orange City Utilities Standard Handbook, and any other applicable requirements of this code. 
2.  Completeness determination. Within five working days of the receipt of the preliminary plat application, the development services department shall determine whether the application is complete. Incomplete applications shall be returned to the applicant with the deficiencies noted in writing. If the applicant decides to correct the deficiencies, a re-application shall be made to the development services department that is accompanied by a re-application fee as adopted by resolution of the city council. 
3.  TRC administrative review. When a preliminary plat application is determined complete by the DSD, the DSD shall furnish copies to the TRC within five days of making said determination. The TRC shall review the application and provide comments to the DSD within 20 days from the date the TRC receives said copies. The DSD shall submit the TRC comments to the applicant. Based on TRC review, the DSD may advise the applicant to revise the preliminary plat or submit additional information prior to referral of the application to the planning commission. Upon receipt of the DSD comments, the applicant shall have 60 days to make revisions or submit the additional information. If the applicant cannot submit the revisions or additional information within the 60-day period, the applicant may request that the DSD grant an extension for a period not to exceed 30 days. Failure to resubmit all revisions or additional information during the 30-day extension period will require a preliminary plat re-application to the DSD that is accompanied by a preliminary plat re-application fee as adopted by resolution of the city council. 
4.  Planning commission review and approval process. When the DSD determines that the preliminary plat application has been revised to address all of the TRC comments and that the application complies with all applicable provisions of this code, including the applicable standards and specifications of the City of Orange City Design Standards Manual and City of Orange City Utilities Standards Handbook, said application shall be scheduled for the next regular planning commission meeting, but no earlier than two weeks from the date the application was determined complete. The applicant or his representative may appear at the planning commission meeting to discuss the application. The DSD will discuss the TRC comments and recommendations at the planning commission meeting. After the planning commission has considered any applicant, staff and/or public comments, and the TRC recommendations, the commission may recommend approval, approval with conditions or denial of the preliminary plat application. If additional time is needed to allow for the resolution of outstanding issues, the commission may table the application until the next meeting, at which time the commission shall recommend approval, approval with conditions or denial of said application. The DSD shall forward the commission's recommendation to the city council as specified in section 6.4.4. of this chapter. 
6.4.4.  City council review and approval process. The DSD shall schedule the planning commission's recommendation for city council action within 30 days of the commission's recommendation. After the city council has considered any applicant, staff and/or public comments, and the planning commission recommendations, the city council may approve, approve with conditions or deny the preliminary plat. If additional time for a decision is needed to allow for the resolution of outstanding issues, the city council may table the application for a period not to exceed 45 days. Failure of the applicant to respond to the outstanding issues shall result in a denied preliminary plat application. A preliminary plat application that receives unconditional or conditional approval may be issued a development order in accordance with the provisions of chapter 5 of this code. 
6.4.5.  Effect of preliminary plat approval. For a preliminary plat that is approved with unconditional approval, the DSD shall issue a preliminary plat development order within five working days of the approval date. For a preliminary plat that is approved with conditions, a revised preliminary plat reflecting said conditions shall be submitted to the DSD within 30 days of the approval date. The revised plat shall be reviewed by the DSD within five working days of resubmittal to determine compliance with said conditions. If the DSD determines that the revised plat is in compliance with said conditions, a preliminary plat development order shall be issued. If the DSD determines that the revised preliminary plat is not in compliance with said conditions, a preliminary plat development order shall not be issued until the applicant revises the plat to meet said conditions. The applicant shall have 60 days from the date of the DSD's determination to submit a revised plat that meets said conditions. If the applicant cannot submit the revised plat that meets said conditions within the 60-day period, the applicant may request that the DSD grant an extension for a period not to exceed 30 days. If the revised plat is either resubmitted but still does not meet said conditions or it is not resubmitted within the 30-day extension period, the preliminary plat conditional approval shall expire. To have the expired application reconsidered, a new preliminary plat application shall be filed with the development services department that is accompanied by a preliminary plat application fee as adopted by resolution of the city council. Approval of the preliminary plat development order shall not be construed as authority for filing of the plat with the county clerk or as authority for the sale of lots in reference thereto, but shall authorize the applicant to prepare construction plans, for which development permits may be issued, and prepare the final plat. Preliminary plat approval shall expire one year from the date of preliminary plat approval unless the time is extended by the city council prior to the expiration; otherwise, the applicant must reapply for preliminary plat approval in the manner provided above. 
6.4.6.  Construction plans. Following approval of the preliminary plat, the applicant shall submit to the development services department construction plans for all proposed improvements in or adjoining the subdivision. Said plans shall be prepared by a registered Florida professional engineer. The DSD shall transmit two sets of the complete construction plans and one copy of the approved preliminary plat to the city engineer within five days after receipt. The city engineer shall review the construction plans for conformance to the approved preliminary plat and all applicable design and construction standards, and specifications and shall report findings and recommendations to the DSD in writing within 45 days. The city engineer and DSD may meet with the applicant and/or the engineer of record within this period to discuss the construction plans as submitted. The DSD shall notify the applicant in writing of construction plan approval or disapproval in whole or part within 60 days of receipt from the applicant. Reasons for disapproval shall be stated in writing. Thereafter, the applicant may revise the disapproved construction plans and resubmit within 30 days or appeal the decision of the DSD as provided for by chapter 3 of this code. Upon approval of the construction plans, the applicant shall provide a computer disc in a format acceptable to the DSD. Upon approval the applicant is authorized to apply for development permits related to the installation of all required improvements or having provides guarantees as required by section 6.6 of this chapter, and to proceed with preparation of final plat. 
6.4.7.  Final plat. No lots shall be sold and no street accepted and maintained by the city, nor shall any development permit be issued by the DSD for the construction of any building within such subdivision, unless and until the final plat has been approved by the city council and duly recorded by the county clerk. The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved by the city council and shall incorporate all modifications and revisions specified in the approval of the preliminary plat.

If the applicant cannot submit the revisions or additional information within the 60-day period, the applicant may request that the DSD grant an extension for a period not to exceed 30 days. Failure to resubmit all revisions or additional information during the 30 day extension period will require a site plan re-application to the development services department that is accompanied by a site plan re-application fee as adopted by resolution of the city council. 
D.  When the DSD determines that the site plan application has been revised to address all of the TRC comments and that the application complies with all applicable provisions of this code, including the applicable standards and specifications of the City of Orange City Design Standards Manual and the City of Orange City Utilities Standards Handbook, said application shall be scheduled for the next regular planning commission meeting, but no earlier than two weeks from the date the application was determined complete.

Section 7.7. - Effect of site plan approvals. 
    For a site plan that is approved with unconditional approval, the DSD shall issue a site plan development order within five working days of the approval date. For a site plan that is approved with conditions, a revised site plan reflecting said conditions shall be submitted to the DSD within 30 days of the approval date. The revised plan shall be reviewed by the DSD within five working days of resubmittal to determine compliance with said conditions. If the DSD determines that the revised site plan is in compliance with said conditions, a site plan development order shall be issued. If the DSD determines that the revised site plan is not in compliance with said conditions, a site plan development order shall not be issued until the applicant revises the site plan to meet said conditions. The applicant shall have 60 days from the date of the DSD's determination to submit a revised site plan that meets said conditions. If the applicant cannot submit the revised site plan that meets said conditions within the 60-day period; the applicant may request that the DSD grant an extension for a period not to exceed 30 days. If the revised site plan is either resubmitted but still does not meet said conditions or it is not resubmitted within the 30 day extension period, the site plan conditional approval shall expire. To have the expired application reconsidered, a new site plan application shall be filed with the development services department that is accompanied by a site plan re-application fee as adopted by resolution of the city council. Upon approval of a site plan and the completion of any site plan revisions as required to meet any applicable approved conditions, the applicant shall furnish the DSD with a site plan in both hard copy drawing and a computer compact disk format acceptable to the DSD.

Section 7.12. - Modifications and requirements above minimum. 
    When, in the judgment of the site plan application approving body (i.e. TRC, planning commission or city council), strict application of the requirements of chapter 7 would produce an inequitable or unreasonable result, stifle innovative or creative design, or create undue hardship when applied to a specific project or development, the approving body may modify such requirements to the extent necessary to achieve equity or reasonableness or relieve the undue hardship. Said modifications that are granted shall not be inconsistent with the comprehensive plan; create nonconforming uses, lots or structures; be contrary to requirements of law or the general policies of this code; nor shall any such modification as applied to one development establish precedent with regard to another development subject to review. Application for such modification shall be submitted by the applicant in writing with the site plan application. If said modification is granted the applicant shall provide a revised site plan to the DSD with notations of said modification. Additionally the approving body may, on a case-by-case basis, request more than minimum requirements related to access, off-street parking, landscaping, and the like as conditions for final site plan application approval where such additional requirements are deemed in the public interest.

CHAPTER 8. - ZONING REGULATIONS 

Section 8.1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of these regulations is to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to promote public health, safety, morals and the general welfare, to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to retain productive agriculture areas and to facilitate the provision of essential government services such as transportation, water, sewage disposal, schools and parks. 
Section 8.2. - Nonconforming provisions. 
8.2.1.  Conformance required. No parcel or structure shall be used and no structure shall be erected, constructed or altered which is not in conformance with the applicable use, lot, yard, height, and other regulations in this chapter, except as may be provided herein. 
8.2.2.  Nonconforming uses. Any principal or accessory use existing on the effective date of this code or amendment thereto but not permitted thereafter shall be deemed a nonconforming use. Such nonconforming use may continue in use provided that: 
A.  The use is not enlarged, increased or extended to be greater than existed on the effective date of this code or amendment, which caused its nonconformance. 
B.  No additional structure is erected or constructed in connection with such use, except that nothing in this code shall prevent the repair or rehabilitation of a building or part thereof, provided, however, that building height and floor area are not increased. 
C.  A use, which shall have been abandoned or ceased in operation for at least 12 months, shall not be reestablished as a nonconforming use. 
8.2.3.  Nonconforming lots. In any zoning district, principal and accessory structures otherwise authorized under this chapter may be erected or constructed on any single nonconforming lot, which existed, separate and apart from other adjoining lots owned by the same person, on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code, if all zoning district requirements other than lot area or width are met. If two or more lots and/or combinations of lots and/or portions of lots that abut in single ownership existed on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code, or if such lots and/or portions thereof are subsequently combined in single ownership with other adjoining lots, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width or lot area, then the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided lot for the purposes of this code. No portion of said undivided lot shall be sold or subdivided in a manner, which does not comply with the lot width, or lot area requirements established within this chapter. Provided, however, a nonconforming lot may be increased in size even if such increase does not allow the lot to meet the minimum lot width and lot area requirements established by this chapter. Provided further, the adjoining lot or lots, from which the land is removed to create the increase to the subject lot, does not become nonconforming or does not increase in nonconformity. Any relief, which may be granted under this section, shall be considered a variance. After the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code, no new subdivision shall be permitted which creates a lot width or area below the requirements required by this chapter. Additionally, nonconforming lots under single ownership that are vacant or developed, may be used provided that the use is a conforming use and the minimum lot width is 50 feet or greater. 
8.2.4.  Nonconforming structures. Any structure existing on the effective date of this code or amendment thereto which thereafter is not in conformance with the yard, height and other requirements of this code shall be deemed a nonconforming structure. Such nonconforming structure may continue in use, provided that: 
A.  It is not enlarged, altered or extended in any way, which increases its nonconformity (it may be altered to decrease its nonconformity, however). 
B.  If it is damaged in excess of 50 percent of its then-assessed value, any reconstruction shall comply with this code. 
C.  If it is moved for any reason, or for any distance, it shall thereafter conform to this code. 
(Ord. No. 210, Exh. A, 8-24-04)

It shall be identified by the signature of the mayor, attested by the city clerk, and shall bear the city seal under the following words: "This is to certify that this is the OZM referred to in chapter 8 of this Code. 
8.4.2.  Amendments. Adopted amendments to the OZM shall be promptly noted on the true copy of the OZM by inserting the ordinance number and date of adoption on or near the affected lot.

8.4.4.  Replacement of OZM. If the OZM is damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the city council may adopt, after due public notice, an updated OZM which will supersede the prior OZM. The updated OZM may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior OZM, but no such corrections shall have the effect of amending the original OZM or any subsequent amendment thereof. The updated OZM shall be identified in the same manner as the original OZM, except that the certificates shall state: "This is to certify that this OZM supersedes and replaces the OZM adopted on ________, as part of this code dated ________. Unless the prior OZM has been lost or has been totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment. 
Section 8.5. - Interpretation of zoning district boundaries. 
    The following rules of interpretation shall be used to locate the zoning district boundaries shown on the OZM: 
8.5.1.  Boundaries following streets. Boundaries following, or approximately following, the centerlines of streets shall be construed to follow those centerlines. If a street is vacated, the district boundary shall be construed to remain in its location, except when ownership of the vacated street is divided other than at the center; in which case, the boundary shall be construed to move with the ownership. 
8.5.2.  Boundaries following lot lines. Boundaries following, or approximately following, lot lines shall be construed to follow those lot lines. 
8.5.3.  Boundaries following county and city limits. Boundaries following, or approximately following, county and City limits shall be construed to follow those county and city limits. 
8.5.4.  Boundaries following water bodies. Boundaries following, or approximately following, the mean high-water line of a water body shall be construed to follow and move with that mean high-water line. Boundaries following, or approximately following, the centerlines of bodies of water shall be construed to follow and move with those centerlines. 
8.5.5.  Boundaries entering any body of water. Boundaries entering any body of water, but not continuing to intersect with other zoning boundaries, shall be construed to extend in the same direction in which they entered the body of water, until they intersect with other zoning boundaries. 
8.5.6.  Increase of incorporated area by municipal annexation. If city limits change through annexation, no use or uses may be made of the property annexed, other than that allowed under Volusia County development and zoning standards, until an appropriate city zoning district has been assigned for the property. 
8.5.7.  Boundaries parallel to or extensions of above features. Boundaries apparently parallel to or extensions of the features indicated in sections 8.5.1 through 8.5.6 shall be construed to be parallel to or extensions of those features, as the case may be. 
8.5.8.  Other cases. Boundaries splitting existing lots in subdivisions and any other boundaries not determined by the above rules shall be determined by reference to the expressed distances on or the scale of the OZM. In unsubdivided property or where a zoning district boundary divides a lot, the location of such boundary, unless the same is indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the original map. Where a zoning district boundary divides a lot, the zoning district of the greater portion shall prevail throughout the lot.

Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an additional 180 days within which to: 
1.  Reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower; or 
2.  Dismantle and remove the tower. The owner of the real property shall be ultimately responsible for all costs of dismantling and removal, and in the event the tower is not removed within 180 days of abandonment, the city may proceed to do so and assess the costs against the real property. The lien of such assessment shall bear interest, have priority and be collectable, at the same rate and in like manner as provided for special assessments by state law. At the earlier of 181 days from the date of abandonment without reactivation or upon completion of dismantling and removal, prior approval for the tower shall automatically expire. 
T.  Finished color. Communication towers not requiring FAA painting/marking shall have either a galvanized finish or be painted a noncontrasting blue, gray or black finish. The color should be selected so as to minimize the equipment's visibility.

CHAPTER 9. - SIGNS[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), adopted June 28, 2016, repealed ch. 9 in its entirety, and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Former ch. 9, §§ 9.1-9.26, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 518, § 2(Att. B), adopted Dec. 9, 2014. See the Code Comparative Table for a complete derivation. 

Section 9.1. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety and welfare through reasonable consistent and non-discriminatory sign standards. The sign regulations in this section are not intended to censor speech or to regulate viewpoints, but instead are intended to regulate the secondary effects that may adversely impact aesthetics and safety. In order to preserve and promote the city as a desirable community in which to live, vacation and do business, a pleasing, visually-attractive environment is of foremost importance. The regulation of signs within the city is a highly contributive means to achieve this desired end. 
    No property is guaranteed signage-all proposed signage must meet the intent of this ordinance and requirements contained herein. These sign regulations have been prepared with the intent of improving safety and enhancing the visual environment of the city and promoting its continued well-being, and are intended to accomplish the following: 
A.  Protect the safety and welfare of the public by minimizing hazards and distractions to pedestrian and vehicular traffic; 
B.  Promote use of signs that are consistent with the Orange City Comprehensive plan and ensure compatibility with surrounding areas, as well as nearby businesses and residents; 
C.  Regulate the location of signs to prevent the distraction of drivers on public streets while providing adequate information and assistance to pedestrians and information to drivers while they remain in their cars but out of active traffic; 
D.  Avoid unnecessary visual clutter and to avoid the unregulated construction, placement and display of signs that are or may become a distraction or public nuisance; 
E.  Provide a means of way-finding in the community, thus improving the pedestrian experience, walkability of the community, usability of transit, and reducing traffic confusion and congestion, and protecting the public in the event of emergencies or in connection with the 911 system; 
F.  Encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication for businesses, organizations and individuals in Orange City; 
G.  Further economic development by providing for adequate business identification, advertising, and communication, while preserving the natural beauty of the city and its unique character districts; 
H.  Prohibit signs of such excessive size and number that they obscure one another to the detriment of the economic and social well-being of the city and its residents, property owners and visitors; 
I.  Differentiate from other signs, the small placards, labels and displays that provide warnings, instructions and the like, in sizes and locations that do not add to clutter and that are unlikely to distract drivers; 
J.  Minimize adverse effects of signs on nearby property; 
K.  Limit signs with commercial messages in residential districts, while allowing those messages that relate to commercial activities lawfully conducted on individual properties within non-residential districts; 
L.  Provide broadly for the expression of individual opinions through the use of signs on private property; 
M.  Authorize the use of signs that are accessory and incidental to the primary residential, commercial, industrial and related uses in the city and to further allow signs that are compatible and in character with the area or roadway where they are located. 
    9.1.1. The federal highway administration has established uniform standards for signs that regulate traffic or that are erected and maintained within road rights of way or adjacent property. These uniform standards are intended to be used by owners of private property that is open to the public to reduce confusion and limit the risk of accident. While these signs are content specific, they serve an extraordinarily important public function. 
    9.1.2. As noted in Reed v. Town of Gilbert, id., some content based signs are necessary to protect the public and are likely to survive strict scrutiny. Signs prohibiting trespassing or solicitors; warning of the dangers of "high voltage" or other hidden dangers may be required for a person to assert property rights or to protect a property owner from liability. 
    9.1.3. The purpose, intent and scope of its signage standards and regulations are detailed so as to further describe the beneficial aesthetic and other effects of the city's sign standards and regulations, and to reaffirm that the sign standards and regulations are concerned with the secondary effects of speech and are not designed to censor speech or regulate the viewpoint of the speaker. 
    9.1.4. The limitations on the size (area), height, number, spacing, and setback of signs, adopted herein, are based upon sign types, and the zoning districts for the parcels and properties on which they are located. 
    9.1.5. Various signs that serve as signage for particular land uses, such as drive-through lanes for businesses, are based upon content-neutral criteria in recognition of the functions served by those land uses, but not based upon any intent to favor any particular viewpoint or control the subject matter of public discourse. 
    9.1.6. These amendments are not in conflict with the public interest, and will not result in incompatible land uses. 
    9.1.7. Objects and devices such as graveyard and cemetery markers visible from a public area, vending machines or express mail drop-off boxes visible from a public area, decorations that do not constitute advertising visible from a public area, artwork that does not constitute advertising; a building's architectural features visible from a public area, or a manufacturer's or seller's markings on machinery or equipment visible from a public area are not within the scope of what is intended to be regulated through "land development" regulations that pertain to signage under F.S. ch. 163. 
    9.1.8. In 1954, the United States Supreme Court recognized that "the concept of the public welfare is broad and inclusive," that the values it represents are "spiritual as well as physical, aesthetic as well as monetary," and that it is within the power of the legislature "to determine that the community should be beautiful as well as healthy, spacious as well as clean, well balanced as well as carefully patrolled." 
    9.1.9. The sign control principles set forth herein create a sense of character and ambiance that distinguishes the city as one with a commitment to maintaining and improving an attractive environment. 
    9.1.10. The beauty of the City of Orange City, both with regard to its natural and built and developed environment has provided the foundation for the economic base of the city's development, and that the city's sign regulations not only help create an attractive community for its residents, but also bolster Orange City's image as a tourist destination, and the goals, objectives and policies from planning documents developed over the years, demonstrate a strong, long-term commitment to maintaining and improving the city's attractive and visual environment. 
    9.1.11. From a planning perspective, one of the most important community goals is to define and protect aesthetic resources and community character. 
    9.1.12. The code is intended to lessen hazardous situations, confusion and visual clutter caused by proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation and excessive height, area and bulk of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic; protect the public from the dangers of unsafe signs; and to permit signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation, and to preclude placement of signs in a manner that conceals or obstructs adjacent land uses or signs. 
    9.1.13. The purpose is to curtail the size and number of signs and sign messages to the minimum reasonably necessary to identify a residential or business location and the nature of any such business. 
    9.1.14. The sign regulations are intended to establish sign size in relationship to the scale of the lot and building on which the sign is to be placed or to which it pertains; to preclude signs from conflicting with the principal permitted use of the site or adjoining sites; and to regulate signs in a manner so as to not interfere with, obstruct the vision of or distract motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians. 
    9.1.15. The sign regulations are intended to require signs to be constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner; and to preserve and enhance the natural and scenic characteristics of this community. 
    9.1.16. The city agrees with the courts that have recognized that outdoor advertising signs tend to interrupt what would otherwise be the natural landscape as seen from the highway, whether the view is untouched or ravished by man, and that billboards are a form of advertisement designed to be seen without the exercise of choice or volition on the part of the observer, unlike other forms of advertising that are ordinarily seen as a matter of choice on the part of the observer, and it would be unreasonable and illogical to conclude that an area is too unattractive to justify aesthetic improvement. 
    9.1.17. Billboards are a traffic hazard and impair the beauty of the surrounding area, and the prohibition of the construction of billboards will reduce these harms [ see Outdoor Systems, Inc. v. City of Lenexa , 67 F. Supp. 2d 1231, 1239 (D. Kan. 1999)]. The continued prohibition of billboards as set forth herein will improve the beauty of the city, foster overall improvement to the aesthetic and visual appearance of the city, preserve and open up areas for beautification on public property adjoining the public roadways, increase the visibility, readability and/or effectiveness of on-site signs by reducing and/or diminishing the visual clutter of off-site signs, enhance the city as an attractive place to live and/or work, reduce blighting influences, and improve traffic safety by reducing driver distractions. Anything beside the road which tends to distract the driver of a motor vehicle directly affects traffic safety, and signs, which divert the attention of the driver and occupants of motor vehicles from the highway to objects away from it, may reasonably be found to increase the danger of accidents, and agrees with the courts that have reached the same determination. 
    9.1.18. By confirming in its ordinance that noncommercial messages are allowed wherever commercial messages are permitted, the city will continue to overcome any constitutional objection that its ordinance impermissibly favors commercial speech over noncommercial speech. 
    The development services director (DSD) shall have the authority to make interpretations of this chapter, including allowances for waivers as outlined herein. 
( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.2. - Applicability. 
    9.2.1. Generally. This chapter shall apply to all signs, including any outdoor advertising or commercial message, which are erected, placed, painted, modified or otherwise used in Orange City. No permanent or temporary sign, outdoor advertising, or display shall be erected, placed, painted, altered, relocated or otherwise used except as authorized under this chapter. 
    9.2.2. Building permit required. Unless expressly excepted herein, building permits shall be obtained, and all fees paid prior to installation, construction, alteration, replacement or relocation of any sign. The changing of replaceable panels on a previously permitted similarly approved sign, which is specifically designed for the use of replaceable panels, shall only require sign review and shall not require a separate building permit. 
    The application shall be accompanied by to-scale engineered drawings demonstrating compliance with this code and showing the message to be displayed, dimensions, including height, width and copy area, construction details, materials, colors, electrical plans, lighting (if any), and dimensions to property lines, buildings, and adjacent signs in respect to the proposed location of the sign to be erected, as well as all the requirements set forth in the Florida Building Code. The request shall identify size, copy area and location of any existing site proposed to remain, as well as any existing signs planned to be removed. Full color photographs and/or renderings of the building, a sample set of the proposed materials and/or paint colors and any other documentation, including photographs and catalogs, which may further support the application or are required to be included. 
    The development services department has 15 calendar days from receipt of a complete application to approve, approve with conditions or deny the building permit. If an applicant wishes to appeal the decision, the applicant must file a request for appeal as provided in chapter 3 of the land development code. 
    9.2.3. Sign review permit. Commercial message signs, otherwise not requiring a building permit and regulated herein, require review and approval by the development services department on a form provided by the city. The development services department has five working days from receipt of a complete application to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the sign review permit. If an applicant wishes to appeal the decision, the applicant must file a request for appeal as provided in chapter 3 of the land development code. 
    9.2.4. Annual sign renewal tag. An annual sign renewal tag must be maintained for all signs after initial installation. On September 30 following the installation of the sign, and every year thereafter on September 30, the owner/applicant must apply for a sign renewal tag. Application shall be accompanied by current photographs of all on-site signage. Provided the signs remain in compliance with these regulations, a sign renewal tag may be issued for a sign for each successive one-year period upon payment of the sign renewal tag/inspection fee, as established by resolution of the city council. It shall be unlawful to maintain any sign without an original sign review permit or a renewal tag. The reissuance of a sign renewal tag does not waive any requirements of this chapter; however, it is the intent of this section that the DSD or designee shall review and/or inspect signs as needed in order to ensure compliance with this chapter. 
    Inspection. All signs for which a sign renewal tag is required by this chapter are subject to inspection by the authorized city official. Signs found to be out of compliance may be deemed illegal signs or may be deemed nonconforming signs and appropriate procedures followed. 
( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.3. - Definitions and terms. 
    Words and phrases used in this chapter are defined in chapter 2 of the city's land development code. Additional clarification of terms may be found throughout the text of this chapter and in the general sign standards.

A.  Traditional Neighborhood Sign District (TNSD). The purpose of this district is to provide for sign standards to protect and enhance the unique character of the city's historic district as well as the areas that influence the historic district and historic landmarks, and to ensure all signs are scaled and designed in such a way as to reflect the historic character of the area. The development standards contained herein are intended to create an attractive, uncluttered and unified historic appearance within the Traditional Neighborhood Sign District (TNSD). 
B.  Gateway Sign District (GSD). The purpose of this district is to provide for sign standards to protect and enhance the unique character of the city (not including areas within the Traditional Neighborhood Sign District), as well as the areas that influence corridor, including local and collector roads (as defined in the FDOT roadway classification system) and to ensure all signs are scaled and designed in such a way as to reflect the character of the area. The development standards contained herein are intended to create an attractive, uncluttered and unified appearance. 
C.  Other. 
1.  PUD master sign plan. As part of the approval of a planned development zoning, the applicant may submit a master sign plan as an additional sheet to the PUD master development plan (PUD master plan), which establishes the sign development standards to be utilized for all development within the planned development. If a master sign plan is not submitted as part of the PUD master plan then signage shall be consistent with the sign district where the sign is located, including consistent theme and adherence to an exceptional level of design for all signs within the community.

iii.  Other design details as may be requested through the planned development and technical review process. 
2.  Existing planned developments. Existing planned developments are required to have consistent theme, sign type, and style throughout the development. Amendments to an existing master sign plan for an existing PUD may be processed as a minor amendment to the PUD. If an existing PUD, which does not already have master sign plan, desires to modify their existing signs, provide opportunity for new types and styles of signs, a master sign plan may be presented for review and consideration as a minor amendment to the PUD. 
3.  Mixed use development without planned development zoning. In any zone in any sign district where both residential and nonresidential uses are allowed, the signage rights and responsibilities applicable to any particular use shall be determined consistent with the applicable sign district and as follows: 
a.  Residential uses shall be treated as if they were located in the residential zoning district where that type of use would be allowed as a matter of right. 
b.  Nonresidential uses shall be treated as if they were located in a zoning district where that particular use would be allowed, either as a matter of right or subject to a conditional use permit or similar discretionary process. 
c.  When uses are vertically mixed in one building the signage shall be calculated consistent with that of the predominant first floor uses and allowing shared signage on the first floor for the uses on the higher floors. 
d.  Second floor uses that have their primary entrance on the exterior of the building may provide wall signage adjacent to their entrance at 25 percent of the sign copy area authorized for their frontage, however in no case shall second floor signage exceed 12 square feet.

_____
    9.7.4. Performance standards for freestanding ground signs. The following general sign standards shall apply to all freestanding primary ground signs in all sign districts. 
A.  Minimum setbacks: Signs shall be setback a minimum of five feet from the property lines or a distance equal to the height of the sign, whichever is greater. No ground sign shall be closer than a distance equal to the height of the sign to any building, structure or property line with the following applicable additional setbacks. 
1.  Signs shall be setback at least 20 feet or double the sign height, whichever is more restrictive, from any other existing or proposed sign. 
2.  Signs serving non-residential uses shall be placed at least 20 feet away from any single-family residential property. 
3.  Secondary ground signs shall provide a minimum 100-foot separation from other on-site ground signs. 
4.  Signs shall not obstruct a clear view to and from traffic along any street right-of-way, alley, or property access way (entrance or exit). On any intersection of driveway or street on which a front and side yard is required, no sign which obstructs sight lines at elevations above three feet and above any portion of the crown of the adjacent roadway, shall be maintained within a triangle formed by measuring 25 feet along the front and side lot lines from the point of intersection of the arterial, collector and local streets. 

5.  See "lighting standards" for additional restrictions. 
B.  Street address number: Freestanding primary ground signs must include the street address number of the property for public safety purposes. Street address numbers shall not count against the allowable sign copy area or the sign height, but shall be placed prominently on the upper portion of the sign, unless an alternate location is approved by the DSD. Such address number shall be integrated into the design of the sign in same or complementary depth, style and materials. 

C.  Landscaping: Landscaping shall be installed around the base of the sign. The size of the landscape bed around the sign base shall be equal to the total area of the sign and shall include Florida native shrubs and/or groundcover plants. 
1.  The quantity of the shrubs or groundcover plants shall be based on the following formula: Overall size of the sign copy × .50 = the whole number of shrubs or ground cover plants, rounded down to the nearest whole number. 
2.  A minimum of two types of plants shall be utilized. The shrubs shall be utilized around the base of the sign, unless otherwise determined by the DSD. The plants shall be a minimum size of one gallon container. 
3.  The placement and type of landscaping shall be identified on the plan, sketch, or blueprint submitted with the sign permit. 
4.  Existing developed sites that are constrained due to right-of-way takings or other unique circumstances may request a waiver to reduce the area of the landscape bed by as much as 50 percent, subject to approval by the DSD. 
D.  Colors and material: Sign colors and materials shall be complementary to the architectural character, colors, and materials of the primary structure and shall not be gaudy, loud, distracting, or of an unnatural nature or color. 
E.  Changeable copy: Automated or manual changeable copy shall not be permitted on freestanding ground signs in any sign district, except as specifically provided below: 
1.  Manual or digital changeable copy may be permitted on a monument-style ground sign so long as the changeable copy area does not exceed 20 percent of the total sign copy area allocated for the sign. 
2.  Approved changeable copy, if any, shall not include any scrolling, moving, flickering or flashing text or graphics. 
3.  Approved changeable copy may change only one time each hour. 
4.  Shall not be installed within 1,000 feet of an existing single-family dwelling. 
5.  The sign must be equipped with software programming controls that automatically determines the ambient illumination and can be programmed to automatically dim according to ambient light conditions within 0.3 footcandle measurements. 
    9.7.5. Design criteria for ground signs. The following design criteria are established for permanent freestanding ground signs: 
A.  Monument style signs shall be designed as provided herein. Monument or pillar signs are permitted in all sign districts. 
1.  Vertical structural supports for a monument sign shall be concealed from view in an enclosed, substantive base that is at least 18 inches in height or 25 percent of the sign height, whichever is least restrictive. Height of the base may be increased if the elevation site is significantly lower than the elevation of the road, without impacting maximum sign height subject to appropriate documentation, including but not limited to a survey with one foot contour elevations and approval by the development services director. The base shall be flush to the ground, allowing no gaps between the ground and the bottom of the sign base. 

2.  The width of the base shall be at least the horizontal width of the sign and may extend up to 50 percent beyond the horizontal width of the sign face. A base at two-thirds of the horizontal width of the sign may be considered for existing developed properties that have experienced right-of-way takings. 
3.  The sign structure including encasement and base shall complement the principal structure, with regards to size, materials, color, finish, and architectural features. This includes the application of upgraded materials to the base, encasement, and along the sides and the top of the sign face or the sign cabinet. Base shall be of decorative materials consistent and/or compatible with the architectural style/building materials of the primary structure, including brick, decorative block, stone or other durable material as may be approved by the development services director. 
4.  A base that exceeds 50 percent of the sign height shall include additional architectural fenestration to avoid the appearance of monolithic pylon. 
5.  Monument-style base is encouraged to be a solid base with no space between the sign and the ground, but may be designed such that two substantive columns form the base from which the sign is mounted between. The base of each column should be at least 25 percent of the width of the sign. The space between the sign and the ground shall not exceed 25 percent of the sign height and shall be integrated as part of a continuous landscaped bed. Base or columns shall be flush to the ground, allowing no gaps between the ground and the bottom of the sign base or columns. 
6.  A decorative cap or other decorative finish that complements the sign encasement and base is required on top of the sign. Decorative caps or embellishments may extend up to 15 percent above the maximum sign height, but must be appropriately scaled to the size of the sign. The height of embellishments which are purely ornamental, is subject to design review and approval by the DSD. 
B.  Post panel signs shall be designed as provided herein: All posts shall include a decorative base as well as multiple decorative/beveled enhancements along the length of the post. Each post shall have a decorative cap, ball and/or other embellishment consistent with the historic character of the structure. 

1.  To enhance the aesthetics and preserve the structure from degradation and weathering, posts and panels shall be made of solid, durable all-weather material that is complementary to the primary structure, and shall be painted or stained in colors that are complementary to the primary structure. 
2.  Sign panel shall be of a solid durable material at least two inches thick, mounted securely between two decorative posts (plywood between two fence posts is not acceptable). Separated panels may be used to enhance character and/or separate different elements of the sign; however, the cumulative copy area on all panels shall count toward the copy area. 
3.  Sign may not be a slick flat surface. Sign face shall be beveled or engraved into the panel to add depth and character to the sign, but exceptions can be made for attractively designed panels that are layered on one another to provide depth to the elements on the sign face-such design shall include design details and materials that are consistent with the historic character of the structure and clearly demonstrate the other decorative and depth-enhancing design elements that are provided. 
4.  Caps, decorative balls, ironwork, or other embellishments may be added to the sign and may extend up to 15 percent above the maximum sign height, but must be appropriately scaled to the size of the sign. The height of embellishments, which are purely ornamental, above the sign height shall depend on design of the sign and is subject to approval by the DSD. 
5.  The height of sign face shall be designed to cover an area between one-third and two-thirds of the height of the sign. The face shall be placed on the poles so that it exposes and open area between sign face and the ground that is 24 inches in height or a minimum of one-third of the sign height, whichever is less restrictive. This space between the sign and the ground shall be maintained even with the use of incidental hanging panels, if any. The space between the sign and the ground shall be integrated as part of a continuous a landscaped bed. 
6.  Regardless of property size, post and panel signs shall not exceed 24 square feet. 
C.  Hanging panel blade signs shall be designed as provided herein. Hanging panel blade signs are only permitted in the Traditional Neighborhood Sign District (TNSD). 

1.  All poles shall include a decorative base as well as multiple decorative/beveled enhancements along the length of the post. The post shall have a decorative cap, ball or other embellishment consistent with the historic character of the structure. 
2.  To enhance the aesthetics and preserve the structure from degradation and weathering, poles and panels shall be painted or stained in colors that are complementary to the primary structure. 
3.  The sign panel shall be of a solid durable all-weather material that is complementary to the primary structure, at least one inch thick and mounted to hang securely from a horizontal mount that is perpendicular to the decorative pole (plywood on a fence post is not acceptable). 
4.  Decorative embellishments or ironwork may be added on top of the horizontal mount and may extend up to 15 percent above the maximum sign height, but must be appropriately scaled to the size of the sign. The height of embellishments, which are purely ornamental, is subject to design review and approval by the DSD. 
5.  Sign height shall be measured to the top of the decorative horizontal mount. Pole projection, cap, ball, embellishments or address number that are placed higher than the horizontal mount, when appropriately designed and scaled, shall not count against the sign height. 
6.  Multiple separate hanging panels may be used to enhance character and/or separate different elements of the sign; however, the cumulative copy area on each panel shall count toward the copy area. The cumulative length of all hanging signage, including hooks, fasteners, changeable panels and incidental signs shall not exceed 65 percent of the allowable sign height. 
7.  Sign face is encouraged to be beveled or engraved into the panel to add depth and character to the sign, but exceptions can be made for attractively designed painted panels with design and details that are consistent with the historic character of the structure and other decorative and depth-enhancing design elements are provided.

( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.10.   General requirements for signs.

    9.10.1. Sign copy area. Sign standards and area determination. Sign area shall be defined as follows, including the graphic illustrations: 
A.  In the case of freestanding, awning or canopy signs, or wall signs where individual letters and graphics are placed on a wall, the entire copy area of the sign designated for the placement of a message is the sign copy area. The cumulative area of signage, as defined by drawing a rectangle, circle or ellipse around the total copy area, including logos and graphics shall determine the sign copy area (see Figures 9.10.1 and 9.10.2). 
B.  In the case of freestanding, awning or canopy signs, the supporting structure, base, encasement or bracing of a sign shall not be counted as a part of the sign copy area-these areas are not permitted to contain any signage. 
C.  For wall, fascia and graphic signs whose message is fabricated together on a solid background, which borders or frames that message as the face of the sign, the sign area shall be the total area of the entire background. The cumulative area of signage, as defined by drawing a rectangle around the total sign face, including logos, borders and graphics shall determine the sign copy area. 
D.  For signs whose message is fabricated together on a common background, accent or frame that message, the sign copy area shall be the total copy area, as defined by drawing a rectangle around the total sign face, inclusive of borders, and graphics as well as any area utilizing the corporate colors. 
E.  When multiple, separate signs or message are utilized for one building, the cumulative copy area as defined above for each separate sign shall be added together to calculate the total copy area. For signs to be considered separate for the purpose of copy area calculation, they must be separated by a distance equal to the average length of the signs or must serve a separate business within a multi-tenant building (see Figure 9.10.3). 

F.  Where a sign has two display faces back to back, the copy area of only one face shall be considered the sign copy area. 
1.  Double-faced freestanding signs. The copy area of only one face shall be considered the sign copy area where double faced signs with opposing faces have an interior angle of 30 degrees or less (see Figure 9.10.4). 
2.  Double signs at entrance roads. When signs are provided on both sides of an entry road, as part of an entry feature or subdivision wall and are placed at an angle greater than 45 degrees from the perpendicular main road, only one face shall be considered the sign copy area. If the signage is at an angle less than 45 degrees, the sign copy area shall be split between the two signs on either side of the entry road (see Figure 9.10.5). 

G.  The following illustration represents a very simplistic example for freestanding primary signs (see Figure 9.10.6). 

    9.10.2. Sign lighting and illumination. Permitted methods of sign lighting and illumination may be divided into several types as described below. Lighting must be consistent with the standards for the sign district where the sign is located. In any case, illumination shall be consistent with general lighting requirements of the land development code such that excessive lighting shall not spill over onto adjacent properties or into the right-of-way. Electrical permits are required for any signage that includes illumination of any kind. 
Maximum permitted illumination is measured in footcandles at the interior buffer yard line at ground level. 

General lighting and illumination standards. 
1.  Backlit or internally illuminated awnings or canopies are prohibited. 
2.  Post and panel signs and hanging panel pole signs may only be lighted by an external, shielded light source. For ground-mounted external lighting, the light fixture shall be screened with landscape material. 
3.  Any lights on an illuminated sign shall be installed or directed in a manner that avoids undue glare, avoids direct illumination or reflection onto abutting properties, and does not adversely affect the vision of operators of motor vehicles on roads, highways or parking areas. 

4.  Any exposed incandescent bulb or lamp may not exceed 60 watts or 800 lumens, whichever is greater. 
5.  The bulb or light source may not be visible and must include a screen or comparable diffusion around the bulb or lamp so that the light source is not visible (see Figure 9.10.14). 
6.  A sign or sign illumination shall not cause any direct glare into or upon any building or property, other than the building or property it serves. Sign illumination shall not emit greater than 0.5 footcandles at the property line that the sign serves. 
7.  Signs located within 40 feet of any single-family residential structure shall not include any sign illumination. 
8.  Neon illumination, tube lighting, flashing, or moving pattern lights shall be prohibited on signs. LED or other tubing may be utilized internal to a sign to provide backlighting or halo lighting, but tube lighting of any kind shall not be externally visible.

B.  The sign is damaged to such an extent that the cost of the repair or reconstruction of the sign exceeds 50 percent of the value of the sign based on the sign structure itself before said damage, said value to be determined based on the depreciated cost of the sign as listed in the original building permit or may be determined by an expert appraiser at owners expense and verified by city staff.

Any redevelopment which would expand the nonconformity or cause additional nonconformities of a sign shall require the sign to be brought into compliance. 
H.  Change in use would trigger loss of non-conforming status for a sign that was issued compliant with Ordinance 96-03-04, a sign that was issued via variance, a sign that was issued via special agreement or a sign that is long-term non-compliant as provided herein. 
I.  Conversion of off-premises to electronic display type signs.

Section 9.18.   Administrative waiver and variance process.
    9.18.1. Administrative waivers. The development services director upon review of appropriate documentation may provide relief up to 15 percent for any dimensional, size, height or locational standards outlined herein. Relief shall be documented in the form of a variance and subject to written request for an administrative waiver as part of the sign permit. A request for waiver shall identify the amount of the variance and include appropriate documentation of existing hardship to support such relief, similar in form and content as required to support a request for variance. 
A.  Administrative waiver review process. Upon receipt of a sufficient application, the development services director shall review the request within five calendar days. Based on the application received, the director shall render a decision on the request, which may be approval, denial, or approval with conditions. Such authorization, if approved, shall be issued in writing and must accompany the sign building permit submittal. The recommendation of the development services director is final. If the applicant does not agree with the recommendations of the director, he or she may process the request for relief in the form of a variance as outlined herein. 
B.  Justification for administrative waivers. In addition to physical site constraints or hardship unique to a property, historic character, exceptional design, architecture or landscape may be used to help support a request for a waiver. The general desire or marketing strategy (or undocumented need) to have additional signage or relief shall not be grounds to support issuance of a waiver or any relief from the code. The applicant shall demonstrate that the requested waiver is the minimum deviation from the code necessary to accomplish the proposed sign. While not considered necessary documentation of an existing hardship, additional support for waivers may include documentation illustrating areas where the site exceeds the minimum land development code requirements. 
Conditions of approval may be placed on any approved waiver. Additional opportunities to support requested administrative waivers or deviations from the code are listed below. 
C.  Signs above eaves or on existing mansard roofs. The development services director may support a waiver to allow installation of a sign above the lowest eaves of an existing building that has unique historic or architectural style that prohibits or extremely limits other viable sign locations below the eaves. Such signage shall be subject to the following limitations. 
1.  The circumstance must have been created by an existing building that was built prior to April 1, 1996. 
2.  Other viable sign locations shall be utilized to the maximum extent possible before allowing limited signage above the eaves. 
3.  The design shall be consistent and compatible with the building design, materials and architecture. 
4.  Excessive signage, at the discretion of the DSD, shall not be permitted. Example: Such signage should not take up the entire signable area at the peak of the eaves, but should accent the space. 
5.  Limited second floor signage may be approved when a building offers non-residential uses on the second floor and which have their primary access on the exterior of the second floor, such as a second floor porch or covered walkway. 
6.  Such signage should not be the primary sign, but should complementary to primary signage. 
7.  Secondary and incidental signs must be installed below the eaves. All other signs on the property must be in compliance with the code or brought into compliance as part of the administrative variance. 
D.  Projecting signs. The development services director may support a waiver to allow 30 percent increase in allowable copy area and the projection of a projecting signage on an existing building where the underlying property has experienced right-of-way takings and/or if the building has unique historic architectural style that prohibits or extremely limits other viable sign opportunities. Such extension in projection may also include extension over public sidewalks or private vehicle use areas. Such signage shall be subject to the following limitations. Copy area shall come from the total copy area allocation for the business. 
1.  Applicant must demonstrate need, including unique characteristics of the property and limitations for other viable sign opportunities. 
2.  Projecting signage to extend over public sidewalks, private sidewalks and/or parking areas or other vehicle use areas may only be considered if appropriate clearance is provided. 
3.  Authorization (or letter of no objection) for projection/encroachment into right-of-way from other reviewing agencies, if applicable. 
E.  Exemplary sign design along an arterial road. Upon illustrating high level of design, both architectural and landscape treatments, that far exceed the minimum code standards, the development services director may authorize up to a 20-percent increase in copy area and/or height for a sign located on an arterial road. 
F.  Cumulative application of different administrative waivers on the same code deviation shall not be permitted under an administrative review; however multiple unique administrative waivers may be considered, unless the development services director makes a determination that the cumulative administrative waivers may have a significant impact and thus should be considered as a variance before the planning commission. 
    9.18.2. Variances. Relief from the provisions of this chapter greater than 15 percent, or that exceed the allowances provided herein and/or are contrary to a recommendation or by the development services director, may be considered by the planning commission under the procedure for variances outlined in chapter 3 of the land development code. 
( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.19.   Enforcement.
    Signs erected, altered, relocated or replaced without a sign review permit and/or necessary building permits shall be deemed in violation of this code. 
    Snipe, sidewalk signs, yard signs, temporary signs, banners in violation of this chapter may be removed by any resident of the city or by authorized employees of the city upon observation by said persons if on public property.

Section 9.8. - Building and wall signs. 

    9.8.1 Performance standards for building signs. The following general standards apply to all building signs located within any sign district. 
A.  Maximum copy area. The maximum allowed building sign copy area is outlined in the following tables based on the sign district where the property is located and the linear foot of primary building frontage. Building frontage shall be a measure of the building length of the primary building frontage and shall be measured in a straight line from one end of the building to the other and shall not include indents or other architectural building undulation. 
Sign District Copy Area per lineal foot of primary building frontage Maximum
Copy Area
(sq.ft.) Traditional Neighborhood Sign District 1 square foot/lineal foot of building frontage 80 Gateway Sign District 1.5 square foot/lineal foot of building frontage none  
B.  If a business has frontage on two or more streets, or has multiple frontage on a parking area and a street, additional signage may be allowed. In such cases, each primary frontage may be considered separately for the purposes of determining compliance with the provisions of these regulations; however, the permitted sign area for one frontage shall not be combined with another frontage to place the combined sign area on one primary frontage. The additional building signage may only be permitted if the secondary facades meet the city appearance standards for primary façade. 
The maximum secondary façade wall signage shall not exceed 50 percent of the primary façade wall signage allocation. 
C.  Increases in copy area may through administrative waiver be permissible for properties who experienced right-of-way takings or whose building face is located within ten feet of the front property line, whereby precluding or reducing opportunity for freestanding signage. 
D.  Sign copy area for wall signs may be increased for taller buildings as follows: 
Building Height
(in feet) Percentage of
Increase 0 to 45 None + 45 to 60 10 + 60 to 75 15 + 75 to 100 25 + 100 to 150 30 More than 150 35  
E.  Sign placement. Signs placement shall be harmonious with the building design. Signs should be balanced and placed aesthetically within the amount of available building fascia, such that at least 20 percent signable area of the wall area or fascia surrounding the sign face shall remain free of any signage or commercial message. 

F.  Street address number. Buildings must include the street address number of the property for public safety purposes. Street address numbers shall not count against allowable sign copy area. If not part of the building or window signage, address numbers shall be placed elsewhere on the primary façade of the building in a prominent visible location as provided in the Code of Ordinances. 
G.  Changeable copy. Automated/electronic, digital or manual changeable copy shall not be permitted on building signs in any sign district, except one decorative hanging panel or manually-changed placard will be allowed as incidental signage so long as it does not exceed one square foot in size. 
H.  Colors and material. Sign colors and materials shall be complementary to the architectural character, colors, and materials of the primary structure and shall not be gaudy, loud, distracting, or of an unnatural nature. 
I.  Construction. Wall signs may be either of one-piece construction or of individually connected or related letters or symbols. A wall sign, which is parallel to the face of the building, shall project no more than ten inches from the face of the wall. 
Aluminum or metal box framing shall not be acceptable in the Traditional Neighborhood Sign District (TNSD). A high level of design articulation consistent with the historic character of the area shall be required in all sign districts. 
Decorative layout, finishes, materials, embellishments and lighting reflective of the character of the sign district and the building shall be required. 
Wall signs shall include decorative framing or other decorative design details and depth based on the type of sign and/or sign lighting proposed. 
_____
    9.8.2 Design criteria for other building signs. 
A.  Canopy or awning signs , which are permanently embedded in or affixed to the flat vertical surface of an awning or canopy, may be provided in lieu of other building signs or to supplement other building signs. Awning or canopy signs are not intended to be used as banners, or to create other floppy signs-the awning or canopy shall be appropriately designed as a window shade or pedestrian cover and scaled to fit the façade of the building, consistent with the appearance review standards in the land development code. 
1.  Copy area may not cover more than 25 percent of the primary face of the canopy or awning. Copy area on a canopy or awning shall count as part of the maximum allowable copy area assigned for total building copy area. 
2.  Embellishments or graphic designs may be allowed on a canopy or awning, if appropriately scaled to the size of the canopy or awning. The type, color and size of embellishments shall depend on design of the canopy or awning, relationship to the building materials and colors, and are subject to approval by the DSD. 
3.  Awnings and canopies may not be backlit. Appropriately designed direct lighting may be permitted. 
4.  All awning or canopy sign colors, styles, and fonts shall be consistent and compatible with all other awnings or canopies on the same building, and must be approved as part of the overall building appearance package, including cohesive theme. 
5.  Awning or canopy signs shall only be located on first floor awnings or canopies. 
B.  Projecting signs or any sign that is attached in a plane approximately perpendicular to the surface of a building may be permitted to supplement other building signage. Projecting signs may be attached to the building or may be designed as a decorative hanging panel sign. 
1.  Projecting signs shall not be backlit. 
2.  Projecting signs shall not project more than 42 inches from the face of the building, unless designed as a marquee sign between two buildings in the same complex. 
3.  Projecting signs shall be placed so that there is a minimum clearance of nine feet from the bottom of the sign to the ground, sidewalk or other pedestrian walkway below the sign. 
4.  Projecting signs shall not extend above any vehicular travel lane of any public street, private street or vehicle use area, parking area or vehicular travel way.

1.  The sign shall meet all the requirements for a monument sign and shall not exceed six feet in height. 
2.  Sign copy area shall not exceed 50 percent of the copy area of the primary sign, as provided herein. Such signage may not be visible from the public right-of-way or adjacent properties that are not associated with the complex; therefore, these signs, if any, shall be set back, sized and placed appropriately. 
3.  Individual panels shall be appropriately scaled for the number of businesses on the sign. Panels for individual businesses shall have consistent sizing, cohesive design, colors, font and theme. The cumulative copy area shall count toward the total maximum copy area. Panels shall be spaced at consistent intervals.

( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.10.   General requirements for signs.

    9.10.1. Sign copy area. Sign standards and area determination. Sign area shall be defined as follows, including the graphic illustrations: 
A.  In the case of freestanding, awning or canopy signs, or wall signs where individual letters and graphics are placed on a wall, the entire copy area of the sign designated for the placement of a message is the sign copy area. The cumulative area of signage, as defined by drawing a rectangle, circle or ellipse around the total copy area, including logos and graphics shall determine the sign copy area (see Figures 9.10.1 and 9.10.2). 
B.  In the case of freestanding, awning or canopy signs, the supporting structure, base, encasement or bracing of a sign shall not be counted as a part of the sign copy area-these areas are not permitted to contain any signage. 
C.  For wall, fascia and graphic signs whose message is fabricated together on a solid background, which borders or frames that message as the face of the sign, the sign area shall be the total area of the entire background. The cumulative area of signage, as defined by drawing a rectangle around the total sign face, including logos, borders and graphics shall determine the sign copy area. 
D.  For signs whose message is fabricated together on a common background, accent or frame that message, the sign copy area shall be the total copy area, as defined by drawing a rectangle around the total sign face, inclusive of borders, and graphics as well as any area utilizing the corporate colors. 
E.  When multiple, separate signs or message are utilized for one building, the cumulative copy area as defined above for each separate sign shall be added together to calculate the total copy area. For signs to be considered separate for the purpose of copy area calculation, they must be separated by a distance equal to the average length of the signs or must serve a separate business within a multi-tenant building (see Figure 9.10.3). 

F.  Where a sign has two display faces back to back, the copy area of only one face shall be considered the sign copy area. 
1.  Double-faced freestanding signs. The copy area of only one face shall be considered the sign copy area where double faced signs with opposing faces have an interior angle of 30 degrees or less (see Figure 9.10.4). 
2.  Double signs at entrance roads. When signs are provided on both sides of an entry road, as part of an entry feature or subdivision wall and are placed at an angle greater than 45 degrees from the perpendicular main road, only one face shall be considered the sign copy area. If the signage is at an angle less than 45 degrees, the sign copy area shall be split between the two signs on either side of the entry road (see Figure 9.10.5). 

G.  The following illustration represents a very simplistic example for freestanding primary signs (see Figure 9.10.6). 

    9.10.2. Sign lighting and illumination. Permitted methods of sign lighting and illumination may be divided into several types as described below. Lighting must be consistent with the standards for the sign district where the sign is located. In any case, illumination shall be consistent with general lighting requirements of the land development code such that excessive lighting shall not spill over onto adjacent properties or into the right-of-way. Electrical permits are required for any signage that includes illumination of any kind. 
Maximum permitted illumination is measured in footcandles at the interior buffer yard line at ground level. 

General lighting and illumination standards. 
1.  Backlit or internally illuminated awnings or canopies are prohibited. 
2.  Post and panel signs and hanging panel pole signs may only be lighted by an external, shielded light source. For ground-mounted external lighting, the light fixture shall be screened with landscape material. 
3.  Any lights on an illuminated sign shall be installed or directed in a manner that avoids undue glare, avoids direct illumination or reflection onto abutting properties, and does not adversely affect the vision of operators of motor vehicles on roads, highways or parking areas. 

4.  Any exposed incandescent bulb or lamp may not exceed 60 watts or 800 lumens, whichever is greater. 
5.  The bulb or light source may not be visible and must include a screen or comparable diffusion around the bulb or lamp so that the light source is not visible (see Figure 9.10.14). 
6.  A sign or sign illumination shall not cause any direct glare into or upon any building or property, other than the building or property it serves. Sign illumination shall not emit greater than 0.5 footcandles at the property line that the sign serves. 
7.  Signs located within 40 feet of any single-family residential structure shall not include any sign illumination. 
8.  Neon illumination, tube lighting, flashing, or moving pattern lights shall be prohibited on signs. LED or other tubing may be utilized internal to a sign to provide backlighting or halo lighting, but tube lighting of any kind shall not be externally visible.

Section 9.18.   Administrative waiver and variance process.
    9.18.1. Administrative waivers. The development services director upon review of appropriate documentation may provide relief up to 15 percent for any dimensional, size, height or locational standards outlined herein. Relief shall be documented in the form of a variance and subject to written request for an administrative waiver as part of the sign permit. A request for waiver shall identify the amount of the variance and include appropriate documentation of existing hardship to support such relief, similar in form and content as required to support a request for variance. 
A.  Administrative waiver review process. Upon receipt of a sufficient application, the development services director shall review the request within five calendar days. Based on the application received, the director shall render a decision on the request, which may be approval, denial, or approval with conditions. Such authorization, if approved, shall be issued in writing and must accompany the sign building permit submittal. The recommendation of the development services director is final. If the applicant does not agree with the recommendations of the director, he or she may process the request for relief in the form of a variance as outlined herein. 
B.  Justification for administrative waivers. In addition to physical site constraints or hardship unique to a property, historic character, exceptional design, architecture or landscape may be used to help support a request for a waiver. The general desire or marketing strategy (or undocumented need) to have additional signage or relief shall not be grounds to support issuance of a waiver or any relief from the code. The applicant shall demonstrate that the requested waiver is the minimum deviation from the code necessary to accomplish the proposed sign. While not considered necessary documentation of an existing hardship, additional support for waivers may include documentation illustrating areas where the site exceeds the minimum land development code requirements. 
Conditions of approval may be placed on any approved waiver. Additional opportunities to support requested administrative waivers or deviations from the code are listed below. 
C.  Signs above eaves or on existing mansard roofs. The development services director may support a waiver to allow installation of a sign above the lowest eaves of an existing building that has unique historic or architectural style that prohibits or extremely limits other viable sign locations below the eaves. Such signage shall be subject to the following limitations. 
1.  The circumstance must have been created by an existing building that was built prior to April 1, 1996. 
2.  Other viable sign locations shall be utilized to the maximum extent possible before allowing limited signage above the eaves. 
3.  The design shall be consistent and compatible with the building design, materials and architecture. 
4.  Excessive signage, at the discretion of the DSD, shall not be permitted. Example: Such signage should not take up the entire signable area at the peak of the eaves, but should accent the space. 
5.  Limited second floor signage may be approved when a building offers non-residential uses on the second floor and which have their primary access on the exterior of the second floor, such as a second floor porch or covered walkway. 
6.  Such signage should not be the primary sign, but should complementary to primary signage. 
7.  Secondary and incidental signs must be installed below the eaves. All other signs on the property must be in compliance with the code or brought into compliance as part of the administrative variance. 
D.  Projecting signs. The development services director may support a waiver to allow 30 percent increase in allowable copy area and the projection of a projecting signage on an existing building where the underlying property has experienced right-of-way takings and/or if the building has unique historic architectural style that prohibits or extremely limits other viable sign opportunities. Such extension in projection may also include extension over public sidewalks or private vehicle use areas. Such signage shall be subject to the following limitations. Copy area shall come from the total copy area allocation for the business. 
1.  Applicant must demonstrate need, including unique characteristics of the property and limitations for other viable sign opportunities. 
2.  Projecting signage to extend over public sidewalks, private sidewalks and/or parking areas or other vehicle use areas may only be considered if appropriate clearance is provided. 
3.  Authorization (or letter of no objection) for projection/encroachment into right-of-way from other reviewing agencies, if applicable. 
E.  Exemplary sign design along an arterial road. Upon illustrating high level of design, both architectural and landscape treatments, that far exceed the minimum code standards, the development services director may authorize up to a 20-percent increase in copy area and/or height for a sign located on an arterial road. 
F.  Cumulative application of different administrative waivers on the same code deviation shall not be permitted under an administrative review; however multiple unique administrative waivers may be considered, unless the development services director makes a determination that the cumulative administrative waivers may have a significant impact and thus should be considered as a variance before the planning commission. 
    9.18.2. Variances. Relief from the provisions of this chapter greater than 15 percent, or that exceed the allowances provided herein and/or are contrary to a recommendation or by the development services director, may be considered by the planning commission under the procedure for variances outlined in chapter 3 of the land development code. 
( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.19.   Enforcement.
    Signs erected, altered, relocated or replaced without a sign review permit and/or necessary building permits shall be deemed in violation of this code. 
    Snipe, sidewalk signs, yard signs, temporary signs, banners in violation of this chapter may be removed by any resident of the city or by authorized employees of the city upon observation by said persons if on public property. Prior written notification shall not be required for the removal of prohibited snipe, yard signs, sidewalk signs or banners. 
    Continued violation of temporary sign code standards shall be grounds for denial of future temporary sign permit request for up to a year after the repeat violations have been documented. Enforcement of any violations of the terms of this chapter shall be processed and enforced by the appropriate city officials in accordance with the enforcement provisions in this chapter and chapter 3 of city land development code. 
( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.20.   Substitution of non-commercial speech for commercial speech.
    Notwithstanding anything contained in this section or code to the contrary and subject to any required face-change sign permit(s), any legal sign erected pursuant to the provisions of this section or code may, at the option of the owner, contain a non-commercial message in lieu of a commercial message and the non-commercial copy may be substituted at any time in place of the commercial copy. The non-commercial message (copy) may occupy the entire sign face or any portion thereof. The sign face may be changed from commercial to non-commercial messages, or from one non-commercial message to another non-commercial message, once per day as desired by the owner of the sign, provided that the size, height, setback, other dimensional criteria and permitting requirements contained in this chapter and code have been satisfied. 
( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.21.   Content neutral sign message.
    Notwithstanding anything in this chapter or code to the contrary, no sign or sign structure shall be subject to any limitation based upon the content (viewpoint) of the message contained on such sign or displayed on such sign structure. 
( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.22.   Severability.
A.  Generally. If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section. 
B.  Severability where less speech results. Without diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth above in section 9.24.A., or elsewhere in this section, this code, or any adopting ordinance, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section, even if such severability would result in a situation where there would be less speech, whether by subjecting previously exempt signs to permitting or otherwise. 
C.  Severability of provisions pertaining to prohibited signs. Without diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth above in section 9.24.A., or elsewhere in this section, this code, or any adopting ordinance, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section or any other law is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section that pertains to prohibited signs, including specifically those signs and sign-types prohibited and not allowed under section 9.17 of this section. Furthermore, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of section 9.17 is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of section 9.17. 
D.  Severability of prohibition on off-site signs. If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section and/or any other code provisions and/or laws as declared invalid or unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect the prohibition on off-site signs as contained in this section and code.

    9.9.1 Secondary and incidental ground signs. The following standards apply to any secondary ground signs: 
A.  Secondary ground signs. 
1.  Secondary ground sign for secondary roadway frontage. For a non-residential property that fronts more than one public right-of-way, one secondary freestanding sign may be allowed for each secondary public right-of-way frontage that the property fronts and has vehicular access (not including alley frontage).

4.  Secondary ground sign for residential communities. For residential communities with nine or more residential units, one secondary freestanding sign may be allowed for the secondary entrance to the community. Excessive signage will not be permitted; however, pillars of same style and materials as primary signage, which indicate neighborhood boundaries, may be authorized. 
5.  Size and height of secondary freestanding ground signs. Secondary freestanding ground signs, shall be the same or complementary style and design as the primary signs. Secondary freestanding ground signs, if any, may have copy area up to 50 percent of the copy area of the primary sign and shall have a reduced height, which is a maximum of 75 percent of the primary sign height and clearly represents their secondary hierarchy. Secondary signs, if any, shall meet the setbacks, separation requirements, and development standards for the applicable sign district. 
6.  Impact on residential uses. Secondary signage for non-residential development shall be discouraged or shall be significantly reduced in size, height and lighting on predominately residential streets or where single-family residential homes are located within 100 feet of the proposed sign.

1.  The sign shall meet all the requirements for a monument sign and shall not exceed six feet in height. 
2.  Sign copy area shall not exceed 50 percent of the copy area of the primary sign, as provided herein. Such signage may not be visible from the public right-of-way or adjacent properties that are not associated with the complex; therefore, these signs, if any, shall be set back, sized and placed appropriately. 
3.  Individual panels shall be appropriately scaled for the number of businesses on the sign. Panels for individual businesses shall have consistent sizing, cohesive design, colors, font and theme. The cumulative copy area shall count toward the total maximum copy area. Panels shall be spaced at consistent intervals.

( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.10. - General requirements for signs. 

    9.10.1. Sign copy area. Sign standards and area determination. Sign area shall be defined as follows, including the graphic illustrations: 
A.  In the case of freestanding, awning or canopy signs, or wall signs where individual letters and graphics are placed on a wall, the entire copy area of the sign designated for the placement of a message is the sign copy area. The cumulative area of signage, as defined by drawing a rectangle, circle or ellipse around the total copy area, including logos and graphics shall determine the sign copy area (see Figures 9.10.1 and 9.10.2). 
B.  In the case of freestanding, awning or canopy signs, the supporting structure, base, encasement or bracing of a sign shall not be counted as a part of the sign copy area-these areas are not permitted to contain any signage. 
C.  For wall, fascia and graphic signs whose message is fabricated together on a solid background, which borders or frames that message as the face of the sign, the sign area shall be the total area of the entire background. The cumulative area of signage, as defined by drawing a rectangle around the total sign face, including logos, borders and graphics shall determine the sign copy area. 
D.  For signs whose message is fabricated together on a common background, accent or frame that message, the sign copy area shall be the total copy area, as defined by drawing a rectangle around the total sign face, inclusive of borders, and graphics as well as any area utilizing the corporate colors. 
E.  When multiple, separate signs or message are utilized for one building, the cumulative copy area as defined above for each separate sign shall be added together to calculate the total copy area. For signs to be considered separate for the purpose of copy area calculation, they must be separated by a distance equal to the average length of the signs or must serve a separate business within a multi-tenant building (see Figure 9.10.3). 

F.  Where a sign has two display faces back to back, the copy area of only one face shall be considered the sign copy area. 
1.  Double-faced freestanding signs. The copy area of only one face shall be considered the sign copy area where double faced signs with opposing faces have an interior angle of 30 degrees or less (see Figure 9.10.4). 
2.  Double signs at entrance roads. When signs are provided on both sides of an entry road, as part of an entry feature or subdivision wall and are placed at an angle greater than 45 degrees from the perpendicular main road, only one face shall be considered the sign copy area. If the signage is at an angle less than 45 degrees, the sign copy area shall be split between the two signs on either side of the entry road (see Figure 9.10.5). 

G.  The following illustration represents a very simplistic example for freestanding primary signs (see Figure 9.10.6). 

    9.10.2. Sign lighting and illumination. Permitted methods of sign lighting and illumination may be divided into several types as described below. Lighting must be consistent with the standards for the sign district where the sign is located. In any case, illumination shall be consistent with general lighting requirements of the land development code such that excessive lighting shall not spill over onto adjacent properties or into the right-of-way. Electrical permits are required for any signage that includes illumination of any kind. 
Maximum permitted illumination is measured in footcandles at the interior buffer yard line at ground level. 

General lighting and illumination standards. 
1.  Backlit or internally illuminated awnings or canopies are prohibited. 
2.  Post and panel signs and hanging panel pole signs may only be lighted by an external, shielded light source. For ground-mounted external lighting, the light fixture shall be screened with landscape material. 
3.  Any lights on an illuminated sign shall be installed or directed in a manner that avoids undue glare, avoids direct illumination or reflection onto abutting properties, and does not adversely affect the vision of operators of motor vehicles on roads, highways or parking areas. 

4.  Any exposed incandescent bulb or lamp may not exceed 60 watts or 800 lumens, whichever is greater. 
5.  The bulb or light source may not be visible and must include a screen or comparable diffusion around the bulb or lamp so that the light source is not visible (see Figure 9.10.14). 
6.  A sign or sign illumination shall not cause any direct glare into or upon any building or property, other than the building or property it serves. Sign illumination shall not emit greater than 0.5 footcandles at the property line that the sign serves. 
7.  Signs located within 40 feet of any single-family residential structure shall not include any sign illumination. 
8.  Neon illumination, tube lighting, flashing, or moving pattern lights shall be prohibited on signs. LED or other tubing may be utilized internal to a sign to provide backlighting or halo lighting, but tube lighting of any kind shall not be externally visible.

The total area of all window and door signs on any side of a building shall not cover more than 25 percent of the individual window or door area (see Figure 9.11.1). The associated copy area shall not count against any allocated building signage. 
A.  Window and door signs shall not include any illumination. 
B.  Window signs shall only be allowed on windows on the face of the building with the primary entrance or the face that the building is addressed. Windows on secondary or rear facades shall not include window signage. Door signs may be provided on any door associated with the business and may also direct the customer to the primary entrance. 
    9.11.2. Vehicle signs. A vehicle sign in excess of one and one-half square feet painted on or wrapped on a currently licensed, legally-operating vehicle that is used daily in the normal course of operation of an business establishment for transportation may be authorized as provided below. 

A.  If a vehicle sign on a passenger vehicle exceeds one and one-half square feet, the vehicle shall be permitted in non-residential areas without obtaining sign review permit, but shall only be parked in the rear of the commercial building, inside the confines of the building; or if no rear parking exists, may be parked at the closest point near the front entrance of the business they serve in a parking space specifically designated and reserved for vehicle loading/unloading or other reserved designation approved by the DSD on the approved site plan for the property. 
B.  Trailers, vans and box trucks or commercial vehicles of any type that include any commercial message, when not actively in use for daily business, shall only be parked to the rear of their associated non-residential building and screened consistent with a site plan service area screening. Any large commercial vehicle, trailers, vans and box trucks or any other commercial vehicle shall not be parked or stopped for more than 15 minutes in the front of the business establishment that they serve. 
C.  Vehicle signs or vehicles with signs shall be not be routinely parked proximate to the right-of way or in a location where it serves as or constitutes additional signage. Signs on vehicles that are regularly parked in front of or near an establishment and not used daily for transportation and the course of daily business, as well as signs on vehicles that are parked adjacent to the right-of-way, shall be prohibited. However, a property owner may, through the conditional use process, request authorization for a vehicle sign or wrapped vehicle to be used in lieu of other freestanding primary signage. Signage that exceeds the code shall be required to be immediately removed, parked in the rear of the business, or appropriately screen as provided herein. 
D.  For purposes of this chapter, transportation shall mean the act of or business of carrying something or someone from one place to another as part of the daily business. 
E.  Vehicles and vehicle signs exempt from these provisions. 
1.  Vehicles with sign copy area that is less than one and one-half square feet on the sides, rear or top of a passenger vehicle shall be exempt from these provisions. 
2.  Any vehicle sign parked on private property when parked within the confines of a building or in some manner which provides for effective screening so as not to allow the sign or signs on the vehicle to be viewed from any public street. 
3.  Buses, taxicabs and similar common carrier vehicles which are licensed or certificated by the City of Orange City, Volusia County and/or the Florida Public Services Commission. 
    9.11.3. Original art displays may be authorized via conditional use approval, which shall demonstrate compliance with the following standards: 
A.  Such conditional use shall meet the requirements of the LDC, shall include a full-color illustration of the proposed original art display, including dimensions and design detail. 
B.  Lighting shall be discouraged, unless design ensures no glare or illumination shall be visible at the property liens or cause nuisance, glare or glow onto adjacent properties.

Section 9.15. - Unpermitted signs. 
    Any sign installed without legal permits either prior to or after this code shall be considered illegal signs and in violation of this chapter. Such signs shall upon notice and due process be removed or permitted in compliance with this chapter. If the city does not have documentation of permits being issued, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner to supply such documentation demonstrating issuance of valid city permits. Renewal of a business tax receipt and/or renewal of sign tag are not considered documentation of issuance of a permit for a sign. 
( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.16. - Abandonment. 
    All signs shall be removed by the owner or lessee to the premises upon which an on-site sign is located when the business it advertises is no longer conducted on the property within 30 days of the vacation of the premises. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign the sign shall be deemed abandoned and in violation of this chapter. 
( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.17. - Nonconforming signs. 
    9.17.1. Existing in compliance. Signs lawfully existing at the time of passage of this ordinance include signs permitted in compliance with Ordinance 157 as adopted by the city council on August 12, 2003. Such signs may be compliant with this chapter or they may be considered nonconforming signs. Signs that are made nonconforming by this chapter may remain as legal nonconforming signs as long as the current property owner owns the property. Once removed, abandoned or substantially altered the sign shall lose its legal nonconforming status and shall be replaced or upgraded to be fully conforming sign as provided herein. Upon change in ownership of the property such nonconforming signs shall be immediately removed or brought into compliance with this chapter. 
    9.17.2. Signs in compliance with planned development (PD) master sign plan. Signs lawfully existing at the time of passage of this ordinance that were approved and permitted under an approved planned development (PD) zoning with a master sign plan, which specifically identified sign types, locations, heights, design, and sizes of all signs, are legal signs so long as they are maintained in compliance with the approved PD master sign plan. Upon change in use or change in ownership, or any amendment to the planned development, such signs may be requested to be upgraded or to add aesthetic enhancements or landscaping, if necessary, including other modifications or reductions in height or type to bring them closer to compliance with the code. 
( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
    9.17.3. Existing, substantially in compliance with new standards. Within one year after the adoption of the sign ordinance, existing signs, which meet the intent of this new sign ordinance and the new types of signs that are now permitted, may apply for a sign compliance permit to illustrate how their current sign meets the intent of the code. While the existing signs may not meet all requirements of the code, the DSD may approve the sign upon illustrating substantial compliance, particularly those in compliance with the height and design requirements herein. DSD may require some aesthetic upgrades or other improvements as conditions of approval. Upon approval of the sign permit and implementation as provided in the permit, the sign(s) shall be considered a legally permitted signs under the 2013 Sign Code or may be nonconforming sign(s) and may remain so long as the current owner is the property owner. Once removed, abandoned or substantially altered the sign shall lose its legal nonconforming status and shall be replaced with fully conforming signs as provided herein. Sign compliance permits submitted within one year after adoption of the sign ordinance shall not be charged sign permit review fees. Failure to implement the conditions of approval shall cause a sign to be in violation of this ordinance. A sign that is unable to meet the intent of the code will not be approved and shall be required to come into compliance as outlined herein. Sign compliance permits as provided in this section shall not be accepted beyond one year after the adoption of this code and all signs, which are not in compliance, shall be brought into compliance as provided herein. Upon change in ownership of the property any nonconforming signs shall be immediately removed or brought into compliance with this chapter. 
    9.17.4. Repair and maintenance. Nonconforming signs as outlined above, may be painted, repaired or maintained, including replacement or change-out of removable sign panels, provided such sign maintenance or repair does not increase or expand the dimensions of the existing sign. Replacement or change-out of sign panels is subject to approved sign review permit. Upon change in ownership of the property, these signs shall be replaced with conforming signs. 
    9.17.5. Loss of legal nonconforming status. Except for normal maintenance or repair, a sign loses its legal nonconforming status and shall be considered in violation of this code if one or more of the following occurs: 
A.  The sign is moved or structurally altered in any way, including increasing its height or width or depth or enlarging it in any manner, including modifications to sign frame, base, poles or lighting, which tends to make the sign less in compliance with the requirements of this chapter than it was before the alteration. 
B.  The sign is damaged to such an extent that the cost of the repair or reconstruction of the sign exceeds 50 percent of the value of the sign based on the sign structure itself before said damage, said value to be determined based on the depreciated cost of the sign as listed in the original building permit or may be determined by an expert appraiser at owners expense and verified by city staff. 
C.  Signs determined to be abandoned under the provisions of this chapter. 
D.  Nonconforming signs or substantial in compliance permits that are not brought into compliance with any required conditions of approval or within the amortization schedules outlined herein. 
E.  Upon the change in ownership of a property any nonconforming sign, regardless of the amortization schedule, shall be brought into compliance. 
F.  Nonconforming signs that cannot demonstrate that they received proper building permits for the installation of the sign. 
G.  Upon redevelopment of a property or a building, which exceed 50 percent of the value of the building or 30 percent of the land area, all existing nonconforming signs shall be brought into compliance. Any redevelopment which would expand the nonconformity or cause additional nonconformities of a sign shall require the sign to be brought into compliance. 
H.  Change in use would trigger loss of non-conforming status for a sign that was issued compliant with Ordinance 96-03-04, a sign that was issued via variance, a sign that was issued via special agreement or a sign that is long-term non-compliant as provided herein. 
I.  Conversion of off-premises to electronic display type signs. 
    9.17.6. Amortization. Any sign that was legally permitted and is nonconforming to the requirements of this chapter, either by variance previously granted or by conformance to the existing sign regulations at the time the initial permit for said sign was issued, shall either be removed or brought up to code requirements as provided below. Any change or extension of the deadlines contained herein must be reviewed by the city council at least six months in advance of the expiration date(s). 
A.  Upon the change in ownership of a property any nonconforming sign, regardless of the amortization schedule, shall be brought into compliance with this chapter. 
B.  Upon abandonment of any nonconforming sign, regardless of the amortization schedule, said sign shall be brought into compliance with this chapter. 
C.  Signs legally permitted and installed in compliance prior to Ordinance 96-03-04 (1996 Sign Code), were given 15 years or until April 2011 to come into compliance. Signs legally permitted and installed in compliance prior to Ordinance 157 (2003 Sign Code), were given approximately ten years or until April 2013 to come into compliance. Such nonconforming signs shall be brought into compliance as outlined below. 
1.  Compliant with Ordinance 157 (2003 Sign Code). Those properties owners that made an investment in their property and legally permitted and installed new primary signage in compliance with Ordinance 157, but prior to this chapter, but do not meet all the requirements of this chapter shall be considered nonconforming signs and upon change in ownership of the property those signs shall be immediately removed or brought into compliance with this chapter. 
Furthermore, the sign review fee for sign installation or alteration as defined in the city Code of Ordinances, will be waived for any nonconforming sign defined as compliant with the 2003 Sign Code that are brought into compliance with this chapter prior to December 31, 2015. Such fees will be reduced by 50 percent for any nonconforming sign brought into compliance with this chapter between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Fee waivers must be requested at the time of permit application. The building permit fees and annual sign fee will apply to all signs regardless of conforming or nonconforming status. All other non-compliant or illegal signs on the property shall be immediately removed upon notice by the city to the property owner. 
2.  Compliant with Ordinance 96-03-04 (1996 Sign Code). Those properties owners that made an investment in their property and legally permitted and installed new primary ground signage in compliance with Ordinance 96-03-04, but prior to Ordinance 157 in 2003, shall be considered nonconforming signs and given until December 31, 2019 to come into compliance with the provisions of this chapter. However upon change in ownership or use of the property those signs shall be immediately removed or brought into compliance with this chapter. All other non-compliant or illegal signs on the property shall be immediately removed upon notice by the city to the property owner. 
Furthermore, the sign review fee for sign installation or alteration as defined in the city Code of Ordinances, will be waived for any nonconforming sign defined as compliant with the 1996 Sign Code that are brought into compliance with this chapter prior to December 31, 2015. Such fees will be reduced by 50 percent for any such nonconforming sign brought into compliance with this chapter between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Fee waivers must be requested at the time of permit application. The building permit fees and annual sign renewal tag fee will apply to all signs regardless of conforming or nonconforming status. 
3.  Compliant via variance. Those properties owners that made an investment in their property and legally permitted and installed new freestanding primary ground signage in compliance with an approved variance shall be considered nonconforming signs and given until December 31, 2019 to come into compliance with the provisions of this chapter. However upon change in ownership or use of the property those signs shall be immediately removed or brought into compliance with this chapter. All other non-compliant or illegal signs on the property shall be immediately removed upon notice by the city to the property owner. 
Furthermore, the sign review fee for sign installation or alteration as defined in the city Code of Ordinances, will be waived for any nonconforming sign defined as Compliant with the 1991 Sign Code that are brought into compliance with this chapter prior to December 31, 2015. Such fees will be reduced by 50 percent for any such nonconforming sign brought into compliance with this chapter between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Fee waivers must be requested at the time of permit application. The building permit fees and annual sign renewal tag fee will apply to all signs regardless of conforming or nonconforming status. 
4.  Compliant via special agreement. Those properties owners that made an investment in their property and legally permitted and installed new freestanding primary ground signage in compliance with an approved annexation agreement or other special agreement with the city shall be considered nonconforming signs and upon change in ownership or use of the property those signs shall be immediately removed or brought into compliance with this chapter. All other non-compliant or illegal signs on the property shall be immediately removed upon notice by the city to the property owner. 
5.  Long-term non-compliant signs. Those properties that failed to come into compliance with either Ordinance 96-03-04 or Ordinance 157 shall be deemed in violation of this code and enforcement action taken. Such properties have already been given an extensive amortization timeframe to come into compliance; however, such properties shall be given until June 30, 2015 to remove non-compliant primary ground signs and come into compliance with the provisions of this chapter. For non-compliant signs in violation of this section, changeable sign panels may not be replaced, and upon change in ownership or use of the property those signs shall be immediately removed, including all foundations and electrical work. Property owners may apply for new primary sign in compliance with this chapter. All other non-compliant or illegal signs on the property shall be immediately removed upon notice by the city to the property owner. 
D.  Unless specifically amortized herein, all other nonconforming, non-compliant or illegal signs on the property shall be immediately removed or brought into compliance upon notice by the city to the property owner.

Section 9.18. - Administrative waiver and variance process. 
    9.18.1. Administrative waivers. The development services director upon review of appropriate documentation may provide relief up to 15 percent for any dimensional, size, height or locational standards outlined herein. Relief shall be documented in the form of a variance and subject to written request for an administrative waiver as part of the sign permit. A request for waiver shall identify the amount of the variance and include appropriate documentation of existing hardship to support such relief, similar in form and content as required to support a request for variance. 
A.  Administrative waiver review process. Upon receipt of a sufficient application, the development services director shall review the request within five calendar days. Based on the application received, the director shall render a decision on the request, which may be approval, denial, or approval with conditions. Such authorization, if approved, shall be issued in writing and must accompany the sign building permit submittal. The recommendation of the development services director is final. If the applicant does not agree with the recommendations of the director, he or she may process the request for relief in the form of a variance as outlined herein. 
B.  Justification for administrative waivers. In addition to physical site constraints or hardship unique to a property, historic character, exceptional design, architecture or landscape may be used to help support a request for a waiver. The general desire or marketing strategy (or undocumented need) to have additional signage or relief shall not be grounds to support issuance of a waiver or any relief from the code. The applicant shall demonstrate that the requested waiver is the minimum deviation from the code necessary to accomplish the proposed sign. While not considered necessary documentation of an existing hardship, additional support for waivers may include documentation illustrating areas where the site exceeds the minimum land development code requirements. 
Conditions of approval may be placed on any approved waiver. Additional opportunities to support requested administrative waivers or deviations from the code are listed below. 
C.  Signs above eaves or on existing mansard roofs. The development services director may support a waiver to allow installation of a sign above the lowest eaves of an existing building that has unique historic or architectural style that prohibits or extremely limits other viable sign locations below the eaves. Such signage shall be subject to the following limitations. 
1.  The circumstance must have been created by an existing building that was built prior to April 1, 1996. 
2.  Other viable sign locations shall be utilized to the maximum extent possible before allowing limited signage above the eaves. 
3.  The design shall be consistent and compatible with the building design, materials and architecture. 
4.  Excessive signage, at the discretion of the DSD, shall not be permitted. Example: Such signage should not take up the entire signable area at the peak of the eaves, but should accent the space. 
5.  Limited second floor signage may be approved when a building offers non-residential uses on the second floor and which have their primary access on the exterior of the second floor, such as a second floor porch or covered walkway. 
6.  Such signage should not be the primary sign, but should complementary to primary signage. 
7.  Secondary and incidental signs must be installed below the eaves. All other signs on the property must be in compliance with the code or brought into compliance as part of the administrative variance. 
D.  Projecting signs. The development services director may support a waiver to allow 30 percent increase in allowable copy area and the projection of a projecting signage on an existing building where the underlying property has experienced right-of-way takings and/or if the building has unique historic architectural style that prohibits or extremely limits other viable sign opportunities. Such extension in projection may also include extension over public sidewalks or private vehicle use areas. Such signage shall be subject to the following limitations. Copy area shall come from the total copy area allocation for the business. 
1.  Applicant must demonstrate need, including unique characteristics of the property and limitations for other viable sign opportunities. 
2.  Projecting signage to extend over public sidewalks, private sidewalks and/or parking areas or other vehicle use areas may only be considered if appropriate clearance is provided. 
3.  Authorization (or letter of no objection) for projection/encroachment into right-of-way from other reviewing agencies, if applicable. 
E.  Exemplary sign design along an arterial road. Upon illustrating high level of design, both architectural and landscape treatments, that far exceed the minimum code standards, the development services director may authorize up to a 20-percent increase in copy area and/or height for a sign located on an arterial road. 
F.  Cumulative application of different administrative waivers on the same code deviation shall not be permitted under an administrative review; however multiple unique administrative waivers may be considered, unless the development services director makes a determination that the cumulative administrative waivers may have a significant impact and thus should be considered as a variance before the planning commission. 
    9.18.2. Variances. Relief from the provisions of this chapter greater than 15 percent, or that exceed the allowances provided herein and/or are contrary to a recommendation or by the development services director, may be considered by the planning commission under the procedure for variances outlined in chapter 3 of the land development code. 
( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.19. - Enforcement. 
    Signs erected, altered, relocated or replaced without a sign review permit and/or necessary building permits shall be deemed in violation of this code. 
    Snipe, sidewalk signs, yard signs, temporary signs, banners in violation of this chapter may be removed by any resident of the city or by authorized employees of the city upon observation by said persons if on public property. Prior written notification shall not be required for the removal of prohibited snipe, yard signs, sidewalk signs or banners. 
    Continued violation of temporary sign code standards shall be grounds for denial of future temporary sign permit request for up to a year after the repeat violations have been documented. Enforcement of any violations of the terms of this chapter shall be processed and enforced by the appropriate city officials in accordance with the enforcement provisions in this chapter and chapter 3 of city land development code. 
( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.20. - Substitution of non-commercial speech for commercial speech. 
    Notwithstanding anything contained in this section or code to the contrary and subject to any required face-change sign permit(s), any legal sign erected pursuant to the provisions of this section or code may, at the option of the owner, contain a non-commercial message in lieu of a commercial message and the non-commercial copy may be substituted at any time in place of the commercial copy. The non-commercial message (copy) may occupy the entire sign face or any portion thereof. The sign face may be changed from commercial to non-commercial messages, or from one non-commercial message to another non-commercial message, once per day as desired by the owner of the sign, provided that the size, height, setback, other dimensional criteria and permitting requirements contained in this chapter and code have been satisfied. 
( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.21. - Content neutral sign message. 
    Notwithstanding anything in this chapter or code to the contrary, no sign or sign structure shall be subject to any limitation based upon the content (viewpoint) of the message contained on such sign or displayed on such sign structure. 
( Ord. No. 558 , § 4(Exh. B), 6-28-16) 
Section 9.22. - Severability. 
A.  Generally. If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section. 
B.  Severability where less speech results. Without diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth above in section 9.24.A., or elsewhere in this section, this code, or any adopting ordinance, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section, even if such severability would result in a situation where there would be less speech, whether by subjecting previously exempt signs to permitting or otherwise. 
C.  Severability of provisions pertaining to prohibited signs. Without diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth above in section 9.24.A., or elsewhere in this section, this code, or any adopting ordinance, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section or any other law is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section that pertains to prohibited signs, including specifically those signs and sign-types prohibited and not allowed under section 9.17 of this section. Furthermore, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of section 9.17 is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of section 9.17. 
D.  Severability of prohibition on off-site signs. If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section and/or any other code provisions and/or laws as declared invalid or unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect the prohibition on off-site signs as contained in this section and code.

CHAPTER 10. - DEVELOPMENT APPEARANCE AND LANDSCAPING STANDARDS 

Section 10.1. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, general welfare and community appearance by providing development appearance standards that foster the development of a well-planned community and create visually compatible and harmonious streetscapes. The intent of these standards is to: (a) create and maintain a strong community image, identity and sense of place; (b) create and maintain a positive visual ambiance for the community; (c) enhance and sustain property values; (d) promote a high degree of compatibility between surrounding structures and land uses; (e) establish and promote a standard for quality design and enduring quality development; and (f) foster civic pride and community spirit by maximizing the positive impact of quality development. 
Section 10.2. - Applicability. 
    The appearance and landscape standards shall apply to all new multifamily and nonresidential development and redevelopment within the city unless exempted in accordance with section 10.7 of this chapter or other applicable provisions of this code. 
Section 10.3. - Submittal and approval requirements. 
    Submittal and approval of site plans shall be in accordance with chapter 7 of this code. In addition, the following are required: A licensed architect shall prepare architectural drawings consisting of all structures, and complete front, sides, and rear elevations, and overhead view of roof. Said drawings shall be submitted as a required exhibit of any site plan required for site plan approval. Such drawings shall be rendered in color and submitted as part of the site plan application and shall include construction material specifications, color charts, structure dimensions, service area and mechanical equipment locations, outdoor storage area locations, screening devices, master lighting plan and any other information as determined necessary by the DSD to ensure consistency with the intent of this code. Final approval of all required project design submittals shall be by the city as part of the site plan review and approval process. Said approval shall include, but not be limited to, building elevations, roof type, construction materials, lighting, screening, colors and building orientation. 
Section 10.4. - Appearance criteria compliance. Compliance with the appearance criteria of this code shall be as provided for as follows. 
10.4.1.  Architectural style and application. While no one particular architectural style is necessarily preferred over another, it is the intent of this code to ensure a harmonious streetscape, compatibility between structures and well-designed transitions between architectural styles from project to project. This shall be accomplished by using of the following techniques. 
A.  Structures within the same parcel shall reflect similar styles, materials, details and colors. 
B.  Structures on different parcels, but within the same master development, shall reflect similar styles and, as determined during the site plan review and approval process, shall reflect similar materials, details and colors. 
C.  Structures on different parcels not within the same development shall reflect styles and materials that are similar to surrounding structures or, as determined during the site plan review and approval process, shall employ architectural techniques that provide for an aesthetically compatible transition between structures. 
D.  In locations where there is no established architectural pattern between adjacent structures or where a change in established patterns will result in improved aesthetics, the appropriate style, construction materials and colors for new development or redevelopment shall be determined during the site plan review and approval process. 
10.4.2.  Building design. Building design shall be such that "boxy" and rectangular structures and blank walls are minimized to accomplish this requirement, the following techniques shall be incorporated into building's structural design (see Illustration No. 1). 
A.  Building mass shall be varied by height and width so that it appears to be divided into distinct massing elements and architectural details can be viewed from a pedestrian scale. 
B.  For structures less than 10,000 square feet in gross building area on the ground floor, no uninterrupted horizontal length or uninterrupted curve of a building facade shall exceed 35 linear feet, except for arcaded facades, which may be allowed to have an uninterrupted length of 60 linear feet. 
C.  For structures between 10,000 and 20,000 square feet in gross building area on the ground floor, no uninterrupted horizontal length or uninterrupted curve of a building facade shall exceed 50 linear feet, except for arcaded facades, which may be allowed to have an uninterrupted length of 80 linear feet. 
D.  For structures greater than 20,000 square feet in gross building area on the ground floor, no uninterrupted horizontal length or uninterrupted curve of a building facade shall exceed 100 linear feet. For arcaded facades, no horizontal length or uninterrupted curve shall exceed 120 linear feet. 
E.  Projections and recesses from uninterrupted facade lengths shall be architectural features and have a minimum depth of three feet. A minimum of 25 percent of the uninterrupted facade lengths shall be of varied length. 
F.  All buildings shall have a minimum of one offset per facade length that is visible from a street right-of-way. 
G.  Blank wall areas shall incorporate the use of landscaping to break up the monolithic and monotonous appearance of such areas. Blank wall areas shall not exceed ten feet in vertical direction or 20 feet in horizontal direction of any building facade unless the use of landscaping, as an alternative to the inclusion of wall area architectural design elements, is approved during the site plan review and approval process. 

Illustration No. 1: Building Mass 
10.4.3.  Design detail. Buildings shall be designed to enhance the attractiveness of the city's streetscape. Buildings shall, through use of architectural details and scale, have architectural features and patterns that provide visual interest from the perspective of the pedestrian. The following techniques shall be incorporated into building design in order to accomplish such requirements (see Illustration No. 2). 
A.  All buildings shall be required to provide a minimum of four of the following exterior design treatments. 
1.  Canopies or porticos, integrated with building massing and style. 
2.  Roof overhangs. 
3.  Arcades, a minimum of eight feet clear in width. 
4.  Sculptured artwork. 
5.  Raised cornice parapets over doors. 
6.  Peaked roof forms. 
7.  Arches. 
8.  Ornamental and structural architectural details, such as bays, columns, gables, belt courses, lintels, pilasters and fascia. 
9.  Clock towers, bell towers, cupolas and the like. 
10.  Other similar treatments determined by the city to meet the intent of this chapter. 
B.  Building facades shall, on all sides that are, or will be, exposed to the general public, include a repeating pattern that shall consist of a minimum of two of the elements listed below. At least one of the elements shall repeat horizontally. 
1.  Color change. 
2.  Texture change. 
3.  Material change. 
4.  Pattern change. 
5.  Architectural banding. 
6.  Expression of architectural or structural bays, such as a reveal, an offset, or a projecting rib, through a change in plane of no less than 12 inches in width. 
7.  Building setbacks or projections, a minimum of three feet in width, on upper level(s). 
C.  Windows (real or false) shall be placed along at least 50 percent of any facade length that is visible from a street right-of-way and/or visible from any adjoining property. Windows shall be recessed or shall project at least one-half inch and shall include prominent sills, shutters, stucco reliefs or other such forms of framing. 

Illustration No. 2: Design Detail 
10.4.4.  Entryways/customer entrance design. Entryways shall be designed to provide project focal points and to provide protection from the sun and adverse weather conditions. As such, entryways shall be designed in accordance with the techniques listed below (see Illustration No. 3). In the event that the entryway is not oriented toward the major street right-of-way that provides access to the building, as determined by the DSD, the side of the building facing said street right-of-way shall be designed to comply with this section. 
A.  Entryways shall be differentiated from the remainder of the facade through the use of color, change in materials, application of architectural features (arches, columns, colonnades, etc.), setbacks, offsets, level changes and the like. 
B.  Entryway design, except in industrial zoned districts, shall incorporate hardscape features such as low walls, decorative paving, water features and the like. 
C.  Entryway design shall incorporate landscaping, landscape planters or wing walls with landscaped areas. 
D.  Entryway areas shall be provided with structural or vegetative shading features and benches or other seating components. 

Illustration No. 3: Entryway Design 
10.4.5.  Building orientation. Buildings shall be oriented so as to enhance the appearance of the city's streetscape. This requirement shall be met by incorporating the following techniques into the project design (see Illustration No. 4). 
A.  The building's entrance shall face parallel to the street right-of-way from which driveway access is provided. In the event that access is provided by two or more street rights-of-way, the building's entrance shall face parallel to the street right-of-way that is determined by the DSD to be the major street right-of-way providing such access. 
B.  Where, because of site constraints or other factors, the building's primary facade cannot be oriented parallel to the major street right-of-way providing driveway access, each facade that is clearly visible from a street right-of-way and/or adjoining properties shall be designed with full architectural treatment. Such treatments shall be consistent with the design requirements of this chapter and shall incorporate door and window placements, facade architectural treatments and detail, roof design and building material applications necessary to give the appearance that each visible facade is a primary facade. 
C.  The architectural treatment requirements of section 10.4.5.B. shall also be applied to any building facade that by nature of the site layout or location is situated where it is visible from a street right-of-way and/or adjoining property, unless the use of landscaping as an alternative to architectural treatment is approved as part of the site plan review and approval process. 
E.[D.]  Building orientation shall be such that service areas are placed out of view from public rights-of-way, parking areas and adjoining properties. Where, because of site constraints or other factors, service areas cannot be located in accordance with this requirement, such areas shall be screened from view by vegetative or structural means. Structural screening shall be architecturally compatible with the building in terms of style, colors, construction materials and finish. Landscape screening shall be compatible with and integrated into the project's landscape plan.

10.4.6.  Building transition. Facade and height transitions between buildings are key elements in creating and maintaining an attractive streetscape. Height and scale of new development and redevelopment shall be compatible with that of surrounding development. To accomplish appropriate facade transitions and to maximize city streetscape aesthetics, the following transitional techniques shall be applied to new development and redevelopment within 300 feet of an existing building (see Illustration No. 5). 
A.  Buildings shall be designed to provide transitional elements and architectural features (architectural style, scale, design details, construction materials and the like) that are architecturally compatible with adjacent structures. Buildings that are twice the height or greater, than an adjacent structure shall also provide transitional elements and features that provide for transitional blending of heights. 
B.  The pattern of placement, proportions and materials of windows and doors shall be harmonious with surrounding structures. 
C.  The ratio of wall surface to openings and the ratio of width and height of windows and doors shall be consistent and compatible with surrounding structures. 
D.  The requirements of section 10.4.6.A., B. and C. may be waived during the site plan review and approval process where it is determined that city aesthetics would be enhanced by a change in the pattern of development that has been previously established by adjacent structures. In such a case, the city shall determine the appropriate style and exterior materials for the new development or redevelopment during the site plan review and approval process.

10.4.7.  Exterior materials and colors. Exterior building materials and colors contribute significantly to the visual impact of a building on a community, which individually and collectively reflect upon the visual character and quality of a community. To project an image of high-quality city aesthetics, building materials and colors shall conform to the following requirements. 
A.  All buildings shall be faced with materials that exhibit a durable, high quality appearance. 
B.  Materials shall be of a low-maintenance type retaining a consistent, clean appearance. 
C.  Generally accepted exterior facing materials shall include, on all facades that are or will be exposed to the public view, brick, tinted and textured or split-faced concrete masonry blocks, exposed aggregate, stone, architectural concrete and cellulose fiber-reinforced cement building boards. Stucco shall be permitted so long as, horizontally, the exposed exterior stucco surface does not exceed 50 percent of any facade. Vinyl siding and wood shall not generally be permitted, but may be allowed on a case-by-case basis if it is determined during the site plan review and approval process that said materials are necessary to achieve design aesthetics or to facilitate transitioning of architectural styles. Metal and/or stucco buildings shall not be permitted, except that in industrial zoning districts metal buildings shall be permitted so long as, horizontally, the exposed exterior metal surface does not exceed 50 percent of any facade length. The primary facade of metal buildings shall not have an exposed metal surface. 
D.  Exterior colors shall not be specifically limited, but shall be consistent with generally accepted tasteful architectural design. Gaudy, day glow and visually overwhelming colors that call undue attention to a building and that are in stark contrast to surrounding properties shall not be permitted. 
E.  Building materials and colors shall be consistent around the entire building. Exceptions to this provision may be made for portions of a structure that are not exposed to the general public. 
10.4.8.  Roof design and materials. Roofs are an integral part of building design and, shall be designed and constructed to add interest to and reduce the massing of buildings. Roof features shall be in scale with the building's mass and complement the character of adjoining structures, developments and neighborhoods. Roofs shall be constructed of durable, high quality materials in order to enhance the appearance and attractiveness of the community. Roofs shall incorporate the design elements and materials listed herein (see Illustration 6). 
A.  The design of roof structures shall be of hip, gambrel, gable and true mansard styles and shall be extended to all sides of the structure. Roof-like appurtenances such as false roofs, parapets and other similar features may be allowed if it is determined during the site plan review and approval process that said features are required for mechanical equipment screening or acoustical control that cannot be accomplished through using of approved roof styles. Application of such roof-like features shall be accomplished in such a manner as to eliminate the appearance of a flat roof design. 
B.  Roofs shall be designed to be of such height, bulk and mass so as to appear structural even when the design is non-structural. 
C.  The roof edge, where visible from any street right-of-way, shall have, at a minimum of two locations, a vertical change from the dominant roof profile. Such change shall be a minimum of three feet. 
D.  Sloping roofs shall have a minimum of two plane changes per primary facade. (Buildings constructed adjacent to street right-of-way intersections shall be considered to have a primary facade on each of the sides nearest the individual intersecting roads.) 
F.[E.]  Roof materials shall consist of concrete tiles, terra cotta, metal or asphalt shingles (laminated, 25-year architectural grade or better) or similar materials that meet city building code requirements.

Section 10.5. - Landscaping. 
    All multifamily, residential subdivisions that create five or more lots, and nonresidential developments and any exterior multifamily or nonresidential reconstruction shall comply with the following landscape standards unless exempted in accordance with section 10.7 of this chapter. 
10.5.1.  Landscaped buffers. A landscaped buffer shall be established along the entire length of, and contiguous to, any property line, and located within a common area. Buffers along side and rear property lines, or abutting alleyways or access easements, shall be not less than ten feet in width measured at a right angle to the property line except that when a multifamily or nonresidential zoning district abuts a single-family residential zoning district the buffer width shall be 20 feet. Buffers shall be 20 feet in width measured at a right angle to the front property line along any local or thoroughfare right-of-way. All buffers shall be landscaped and provide visual screening as follows. 
A.  The front yard buffer shall be landscaped with trees of a minimum 2.5-inch caliper, and 14 feet in height at planting. The trees shall be planted every 40 feet. A minimum of four understory trees, of a minimum 1.5-inch caliper and a minimum eight feet in height, per 100 linear feet of street frontage or fraction thereof shall be planted in and about access points and intersections. In addition, a minimum of 15 percent of said buffer area shall be covered with shrubs or groundcover. The trees shall be placed in the groundcover beds where possible. In addition to the shrubs or groundcover requirement, the planting of flowering perennials and/or shrubs within said buffer is required. 
B.  If an off-street parking or other vehicular use area abuts the front yard buffer, said area shall not only be landscaped as required by section 10.5.1.A. but also be screened as follows. 
1.  A continuous shrub hedge shall be planted within the buffer. The shrub hedge plant materials shall be planted on 24 inch centers, shall be at least 2.5 feet in height at time of planting and obtain a height of three feet within 12 months of planting under normal growing conditions so as to screen a minimum of 75 percent of said parking or vehicular use area to that height, as viewed from the right-of-way. 
2.  If a berm is used for screening, said berm shall be at least two feet in height and additional landscaping at least one foot in height shall be planted on top of the berm. 
3.  If a decorative wall is used for screening, said wall shall not exceed four feet in height. Shrubs shall be planted abutting the exterior side of the wall facing the street at a planting interval of no greater than five feet. Said shrubs may be planted in groupings on the exterior side of the wall facing the street. 
C.  Side and rear yard buffers shall be landscaped with trees of a minimum 2.5-inch caliper, and 14 feet in height at planting, planted for each 50 linear feet or fraction thereof of said buffer. In addition, a minimum of 15 percent of said buffer area shall be covered with shrubs or groundcover. The trees shall be placed in the groundcover beds where possible. 
D.  If an off-street parking area or other vehicular use area abuts a side or rear yard buffer and said area is not entirely screened visually from abutting property, said buffer shall contain a hedge, decorative wall or fence not less than four feet in height, and no greater than six feet in height. The visual screen shall be continuous between the off-street parking area or other vehicular use area and the abutting property. If plant materials are used for screening, said materials shall be capable of obtaining a four-foot height in 12 months from the time said materials were planted. An existing continuous structural visual screen on the abutting property shall be considered adequate visual screening for this requirement. 
E.  When a side or rear yard buffer abuts or is across the street from any residential zoning district in the city and/or county said buffer shall be planted and screened in the following manner. 
1.  One tree with a minimum 2.5-inch caliper, and 14 feet in height at planting, shall be planted for each 50 linear feet or fraction thereof of said buffer. In addition, a minimum of 15 percent of said buffer area shall be covered with shrubs or groundcover. The trees shall be placed in the groundcover beds where possible. 
2.  A visual screen consisting of plant materials, or a decorative wall or fence shall be installed. If plant material is used for screening, said materials shall be selected and located to provide, within two years, a visual barrier that is six feet above the average ground level of the buffer. If a decorative wall or fence is used for screening, said wall or fence shall not exceed four feet in height along the front property line and eight feet in height on side and rear property lines. Shrubs or vines shall be planted abutting the exterior side of the wall facing the adjoining property at a planting interval no greater than five feet. 
F.  Existing vegetation shall be used where possible to meet these requirements. Where plant materials will be planted to meet these requirements, drought tolerant plant materials shall be used in order to minimize water usage for irrigation. 
G.  Landscaping shall be maintained in excellent condition at all times and shall be replaced in the event of disease or death of plant materials. The enforcement official shall notify the property owner which plant material are diseased or dead and then the property owner shall replace said plant material within 30 days of notification. 
H.  Landscape materials shall be pruned only to promote healthy, uniform, natural growth of the vegetation. Trees shall not be pruned severely in order to permanently maintain growth at a reduced height or spread. The owner shall replace severely pruned trees. 
10.5.2.  Landscaped parking/vehicular use areas. Landscaped areas shall be provided within the interior of the parking/vehicular use areas to break up continuous parking spaces, reduce surface heat and provide an aesthetically pleasing interior environment. Such landscaping shall cover a minimum of ten percent of the total off-street parking and vehicular use area. If the ten percent requirement cannot be met, architectural planters may be permitted in lieu of landscaped areas. Side and rear yard buffers and five feet of the front yard buffers as required by section 10.5.1. shall not be used as a credit towards meeting the landscape requirements for parking/vehicular use areas. All landscaped areas shall be protected from vehicular damage by a raised concrete curb of at least six inches in height. Interior parking/vehicular use areas that access to a designated corridor shall be designed using the landscaping combinations and criteria of section 10.5.2.A., B. and C. (Preferred combinations are A, B and C or A and C. However, combination B and C or C individually, may be approved through the site plan review and approval process where it is determined that individual site or land usage characteristics necessitate use of such techniques.) 
A.  Landscape strips/divider medians. Landscaped strips should be used to separate rows of abutting parking. Where landscaped strips are used, such strips shall be a minimum width of six feet. Such strips shall be planted with drought tolerant shrubs, ground cover and/or grass and shall contain a minimum of two canopy trees and two understory trees for every 100 feet of length. The canopy trees shall be a minimum of 2.5-inch caliper and 14 feet in height at time of planting. The understory trees shall be a minimum of 1.5-inch caliper and eight feet in height at time of planting. When shrubs are planted, the ground area surrounding the shrubs shall be planted with drought tolerant groundcover plants and mulched. 
B.  Interior islands. Interior islands should be used to break up uninterrupted parking spaces. A maximum of ten continuous parking spaces shall be permitted without a landscaped island. Interior islands shall be a minimum of 200 square feet without a landscaped strip for single parking spaces and 400 square feet without a landscaped strip, for double parking rows. Where interior islands are combined with landscaped strips, the aforementioned square footage requirement shall be in addition to the area required for the landscaped strip interior islands. Islands must be planted with grass and/or shrubs and contain a minimum of one canopy tree, 2.5-inch caliper and 14 feet in height for every 200 square feet of area or a minimum of two understory trees of a minimum 1.5-inch caliper and eight feet in height for every 200 square feet of area. When shrubs are planted, the ground area surrounding the shrubs shall be mulched or planted with drought tolerant groundcover plants and mulched. Each island shall be depicted on the site plan with exact square footage measurement. 
C.  Terminal islands. Terminal islands should be used to terminate parking bays and to separate parking from adjacent drive aisles. Terminal islands shall be located at the end of each drive aisle and parking bay. A maximum of ten continuous parking spaces shall be permitted between the interior islands and the terminal island. Each terminal island shall be a minimum of 200 square feet without a landscaped strip, for single parking spaces, and 400 square feet without a landscaped strip, for double parking rows. Where terminal islands are combined with landscaped strips, the aforementioned square footage requirement shall be in addition to the area required for the landscaped strip. Terminal islands shall be planted with grass and/or shrubs and contain a minimum of one canopy tree, 2.5-inch caliper and 14 feet in height at time of planting for every 200 square feet of area or a minimum of two understory trees of a minimum of three 1.5-inch caliper and eight feet in height at time of planting for every 200 square feet of area. When shrubs are planted, the ground area surrounding the shrubs shall be mulched or planted with drought tolerant groundcover plants and mulched. Shrubs shall be required to provide a minimum of 35 percent coverage of terminal islands and not to exceed 30 inches in height. Each island shall be depicted on the site plan with exact square footage measurement. 
10.5.3.  Perimeter building landscaping. Landscaping around the perimeter of buildings enhances site aesthetics, increases green space and increases oxygen output. All projects shall incorporate perimeter landscaping into the project design in accordance with the requirements listed below (see Illustration No. 8). 
A.  Perimeter landscape plant materials shall be located adjacent to the primary facade and along any blank facade wall areas that are, or will be, exposed to the general public. Said plant materials shall also be included at entrance areas, plazas and courtyards. 
B.  Perimeter landscape plant materials shall consist of a combination of trees, palms, shrubs and ground covers that are drought tolerant. Perimeter planting beds shall be a minimum of five feet wide to provide the space necessary for plant growth. Landscape plant material type, size and spacing shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the requirements of this code. Tree diameter inches provided for perimeter landscaping purposes shall be counted toward the tree diameter inch requirements for any project. 
C.  Architectural planters may be permitted by the DSD in fulfillment of pervious area requirements. Such architectural planters shall contain a surface area of not less than ten square feet and shall have a minimum dimension of 15 inches. 
10.5.4.  Installation of landscaping. All landscaping shall be installed according to accepted commercial planting procedures as prescribed by the American Society of Landscape Architects. Soil, free of limerock, pebbles, or other construction debris, shall be provided. All landscaped areas shall be protected from vehicular encroachment by wheel stops or curbing. Curbing may be perforated to permit drainage from the paved surface areas onto landscape areas. 
10.5.5.  Plant materials. All plant material shall meet or exceed standards for Florida No. 1, as determined by the state department of agriculture and consumer services. Specified plant material sizes, heights and spreads shall be considered minimum planting requirements. Special consideration should be given to combining solid-colored plant materials with variegated colored materials to add color and visual interest to the landscape. Plant materials that are known to be intolerant of paving environments or the physical characteristics of which may be injurious to the public shall not be permitted. 
A.  All trees shall have a minimum height of eight feet immediately upon planting and have trunks that can be maintained in a clean condition for over six feet of clear wood measured from the ground level. A minimum radius of 2.5 feet of landscaped area must be provided between the trunk of the tree and the edge of the landscaped area. Tree species having a root system that is likely to cause damage to public roadways or other public improvements shall not be planted nearer than 12 feet to such improvements. If palms are used, said trees shall not exceed 50 percent of the required number of diameter inches. 
B.  Ground covers, other than grass, shall be planted in such a manner as to present a finished appearance and reasonably complete coverage. Grass shall be planted with a species normally grown as permanent lawns in Central Florida. Grass areas shall be sodded. Synthetic or artificial material in the form of trees, shrubs, ground covers or vines shall not be used in lieu of plant requirements. 
10.5.6.  Plant material maintenance. The owner, or his agent, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping in good condition so as to present a neat, healthy and orderly appearance, free of refuse and debris. Any dead or severely damaged plant materials, including trees, shall be replaced by the owner, tenant or agent as part of routine maintenance. Removal of required plant materials without prior authorization from the DSD is a violation of this provision and will be subject to the penalties provided in chapter 11, tree protection, land development code. 
10.5.7.  Recommended plant list. Appendix A is the recommended plant list for use in meeting the landscaping requirements of this code. The developer/property owner may use any of the list of recommended plant material to meet landscape requirements of this code.

10.6.5.  Screening of mechanical equipment. Lack of, or inadequate screening of, mechanical equipment can have a negative visual impact on the city's streetscape, ambient landscape or community image. Said impact shall be minimized through compliance with the following requirements. 
A.  Mechanical equipment located on the ground, such as air conditioning units, heating units, satellite dishes, irrigation pumps, propane tank displays and refilling areas, lift stations and the like shall be screened from public view. Screening shall, at a minimum, be at the same height as the equipment. Structural screening shall be architecturally integrated into the overall project design and shall be compatible, in terms of style, construction materials, colors and finish with the principle structure(s). Landscaping may be substituted for structural screening if plantings are compatible with the landscape plan for the project and are of such size and maturity as to provide a fully opaque screen at time of planting. 
B.  Equipment and appurtenances mounted on rooftops shall be kept to a minimum. All exposed rooftop mounted equipment and appurtenances shall be fully screened from view from any street right-of-way. All screening shall, at a minimum, be at the same height as the equipment and appurtenances. Screening shall be an integral part of the design of the building and shall be architecturally consistent with the style, colors, construction materials and finish of the building. Painting of exposed appurtenances to blend with the color of adjacent materials of the building may be approved where use of approved roof designs preclude full screening of exposed surfaces. 
10.6.6.  Screening of trash dumpster. Lack of, or inadequate screening of, trash dumpster can have a negative visual impact on the city's streetscape, ambient landscape or community image. Said impact shall be minimized by screening dumpsters on all four sides with a solid wall that at a minimum is the same height as the dumpster. Screening walls shall be architecturally integrated into the overall project design and shall be substantially compatible in terms of style, construction materials, colors and finish with principle structure, as determined by the development services director. The perimeter of all screening walls shall be landscaped, except for the side used to access the dumpster. 
    Any dumpster or additional dumpster placed on a site following issuance of the original development order, will require approval by amendment to the original development order and must be screened in accordance with these requirements. Such additional screening enclosures must also be reviewed and approved by the development services department. 
10.6.7.  Lighting. Lighting fixture design and placement are important components of an attractive urban environment as well as important to public safety. To enhance site aesthetics and minimize visual distraction, yet maintain adequate public safety, lighting for all multi-family and nonresidential development shall comply with the following requirements. (See Illustration No. 9.) 
A.  An exterior building and site lighting master plan detailing areas and structures requiring illumination, lighting fixture styles, light source and light levels shall be included as part of a project's site plan submittal. 
B.  Recessed lighting fixtures shall be required in order to conceal the actual light source, reduce glare and direct light to specific areas while shielding other areas. 
C.  Backlit awnings and/or canopies are prohibited unless approved by the DSD. 
D.  Lighting of parking areas, access drives and vehicular circulation areas shall be as follows. 
1.  Lighting shall be by a full cut-off shield type fixture mounted at the top of a pole.

Section 11.15. - Tree bank. 
    Should it be physically impossible according to accepted good planning procedures to replace all required replacement trees. The DSD may allow the developer to make a contribution to the city's tree bank based on the banking formula listed here. Contributions to the tree bank shall be reserved to enhance city property and rights-of-way with tree installation, replacement and maintenance. 
TREE BANKING FORMULA 
Number of DBH inches of trees to be removed divided by 2 × $230.00. 
Notes: 
(A 21/2" tree measured at 12" height (caliper) is equal to a 2" tree measured at DBH, 4.5' height. 
$230.00 is the estimated cost to plant, stake, mulch and irrigate a 2-inch DBH tree according to the Central Florida Community Tree Guide from the United States Department of Agriculture, General Technical Report dated September 2010. 
Example: 18" specimen tree to be removed = 9 replacement trees at 2" DBH = $230.00 × 9 = $2,070.00 to be tree banked with the city.

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Division 1 has been added at the discretion of the editor, in order to maintain the code format. 

Section 13.1. - General. 
A.  Title. These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance, hereinafter referred to as "this chapter," of the City of Orange City, Florida, hereinafter referred to as "city". 
B.  Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development, or any other land disturbing activities. 
C.  Intent. The purposes of this chapter and the flood load and flood-resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
1.  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
2.  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
3.  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
4.  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
5.  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
6.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
7.  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
8.  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for city participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
D.  Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This chapter is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
E.  Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this city, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this city to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this chapter. 
F.  Disclaimer of liability. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City Council of the City of Orange City, Florida, or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
G.  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter supersedes any ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances including but not limited to land development regulations, zoning ordinances, stormwater management regulations, or the Florida Building Code. In the event of a conflict between this chapter and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern. This chapter shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject to such interests shall also be governed by this chapter. 
H.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
1.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
2.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
3.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

[of this section] is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, and all due consideration has been given to use of methods and materials that minimize flood damage during occurrence of the base flood. 
G.  Considerations for issuance of variances. In reviewing requests for variances, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all other applicable provisions of the Florida Building Code, this chapter, and the following: 
1.  The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or damage; 
2.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners; 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the city; 
5.  The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development that are subject to lower risk of flooding or erosion; 
6.  The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
7.  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
8.  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
9.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
10.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
H.  Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
1.  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this chapter or the required elevation standards; 
2.  Determination by the planning commission that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
3.  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
4.  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain management administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 or $100.00 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any Assessment under the provisions of this Ordinance shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any Assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such Assessment was duly levied, that the Assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such Assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this Ordinance; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, any party objecting to an Assessment imposed pursuant to this Ordinance must file an objection with a court of competent jurisdiction within the time periods prescribed herein. 
Section 2.04. - Correction of errors and omissions. 
(A)  No act of error or omission on the part of the Property Appraiser, Tax Collector, City Manager, City Council, their deputies, employees, or designees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of an Assessment imposed by the City Council under the provision of this Ordinance. 
(B)  When it shall appear that any Assessment should have been imposed under this Ordinance against a lot or parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of a service, facility, program, or Local Improvement, but such property was omitted from the Assessment Roll, the City Council may, upon provision of appropriate notice as set forth in this Article, impose the applicable Assessment for the Fiscal Year in which such error is discovered, in addition to the applicable Assessment due for the prior two Fiscal Years. Such total Assessment shall become delinquent if not fully paid upon the expiration of 60 days from the date of the adoption of said resolution. The Assessment so imposed shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved and may be collected as provided in Article VI hereof. 
(C)  The City Manager shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the Owner of any Assessed Property, to correct any error in applying the Assessment apportionment method to any particular property not otherwise requiring the provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any such correction that reduces an Assessment shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the Assessment imposed under the provisions of this Ordinance. Any such correction which increases an Assessment or imposes an Assessment on omitted property shall first require notice to the affected owner in the manner described in Sections 3.05 and 4.05 hereof, as applicable, providing the date, time and place that the City Council will consider confirming the correction and offering the owner an opportunity to be heard. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the City Manager and not, the Property Appraiser or Tax Collector. 
(D)  After the Assessment Roll has been delivered to the Tax Collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the Tax Roll upon timely written request and direction of the City Manager. 
Section 2.05. - Lien of Assessments. 
    Upon the adoption of the Assessment Roll, all Assessments shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims, until paid. The lien for an Assessment shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the City Council of the Final Assessment Resolution or the Annual Rate Resolution, whichever is applicable. The lien for an Assessment collected under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act shall attach to the property as provided by law. The lien for an Assessment collected under the alternative method of collection provided in Section 6.02 shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the City Council of the Final Assessment Resolution or the Annual Rate Resolution, whichever is applicable, and shall attach to the property on such date of adoption. 
ARTICLE III. - SERVICE ASSESSMENTS 

Section 3.01. - General authority. 
(A)  The City Council is hereby authorized to impose an annual Service Assessment to fund all or any portion of the Service Cost on benefitted property at a rate of assessment based on the special benefit accruing to such property from the City's provision of the subsequently identified service, facility, or program. The amount of the Service Assessment that is imposed each Fiscal Year against each parcel of Assessed Property shall be determined pursuant to an apportionment methodology based upon a classification of property designed to provide a fair and reasonable apportionment of the Service Cost among properties on a basis reasonably related to the special benefit provided by the service, facility, or program funded with assessment proceeds. Nothing contained in this Ordinance shall be construed to require the imposition of Assessments against Government Property. 
(B)  All Service Assessments shall be imposed in conformity with the procedures set forth in this Article III. 
Section 3.02. - Initial proceedings. 
    The initial proceeding for the imposition of a Service Assessment shall be the City Council's adoption of an Initial Assessment Resolution (A) describing the property to be located within any proposed Assessment Area; (B) containing a brief and general description of the services, facilities, or programs to be provided; (C) determining the Service Cost to be assessed; (D) describing the method of apportioning the Service Cost and the computation of the Assessments for specific properties; (E) establishing an estimated assessment rate for the upcoming Fiscal Year; (F) establishing a Maximum Assessment Rate, if desired by the City Council; (G) authorizing the date, time, and place of a public hearing to consider the adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution for the upcoming Fiscal Year; and (H) directing the City Manager to (1) prepare the initial Assessment Roll, as required by Section 3.03 hereof, (2) publish the notice required by Section 3.04 hereof, and (3) mail the notice required by Sections 3.05 hereof.

Section 3.04. - Notice by publication. 
    Upon completion of the initial Assessment Roll and each year thereafter, the City Manager shall publish notice of a public hearing to adopt the Final Assessment Resolution and approve the aforementioned initial Assessment Roll.

Notice shall be deemed mailed upon delivery thereof to the possession of the United States Postal Service. Failure of the Owner to receive such notice due to mistake or inadvertence, shall not affect the validity of the Assessment Roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of a Service Assessment imposed by the City Council pursuant to this Ordinance. Notice by mail for Fiscal Years after the initial Fiscal Year shall be controlled by Section 3.08(C) hereof. 
Section 3.06. - Adoption of Final Assessment Resolution. 
    At the time named in such notice or to such time as an adjournment or continuance may be taken by the City Council, the City Council shall receive any written objections of interested persons and may then, or at any subsequent meeting of the City Council, adopt the Final Assessment Resolution which shall (A) create any Assessment Area; (B) confirm, modify, or repeal the Initial Assessment Resolution with such amendments, if any, as may be deemed appropriate by the City Council; (C) establish the Maximum Assessment Rate, if desired by the City Council and set the rate of assessment to be imposed in the upcoming fiscal year; (D) approve the initial Assessment Roll, with such amendments as it deems just and right; and (E) determine the method of collection.

All objections to the Final Assessment Resolution shall be made in writing, and filed with the City Manager at or before the time or adjourned time of such hearing. The Final Assessment Resolution shall constitute the Annual Rate Resolution for the initial Fiscal Year in which Assessments are imposed or reimposed hereunder. 
Section 3.07. - Effect of Final Assessment Resolution. 
    The Service Assessments for the initial Fiscal Year shall be established upon adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution. The adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented (including, but not limited to, the method of apportionment and assessment, the Maximum Assessment Rate, the initial rate of assessment, the initial Assessment Roll, and the levy and lien of the Service Assessments), unless proper steps are initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within 20 days from the date of City Council action on the Final Assessment Resolution. The initial Assessment Roll, as approved by the Final Assessment Resolution, shall be delivered to the Tax Collector, or the Property Appraiser if so directed by the Tax Collector, or if an alternative method is used to collect the Service Assessments, such other official as the City Council by resolution shall designate. 
Section 3.08. - Adoption of Annual Rate Resolution. 
(A)  During its budget adoption process and prior to September 15 of each year, the City Council shall adopt an Annual Rate Resolution for each Fiscal Year following the initial Fiscal Year for which a Service Assessment is imposed hereunder. 
(B)  The initial proceedings for the adoption of an Annual Rate Resolution for a Service Assessment imposed to fund the Service Cost of a service, facility or program shall be the adoption of a Preliminary Rate Resolution in accordance with Section 3.02 hereof. The Annual Rate Resolution shall approve the Assessment Roll for the upcoming Fiscal Year. The Assessment Roll shall be prepared in accordance with the method of apportionment set forth in the Initial Assessment Resolution or most recent Preliminary Rate Resolution together with modifications, if any, and as confirmed in the Final Assessment Resolution or most recent Annual Rate Resolution. 
(C)  In the event that the uniform method of collection provided for in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act is used and (1) the proposed Service Assessment for any Fiscal Year exceeds the Maximum Assessment Rate included in notice previously provided to the Owners of Assessed Property pursuant to Sections 3.04 and 3.05 hereof, (2) the method of apportionment is changed or the purpose for which the Service Assessment is imposed is substantially changed from that represented by notice previously provided to the Owners of Assessed Property pursuant to Sections 3.04 and 3.05 hereof, (3) Assessed Property is reclassified in a manner which results in an increased Service Assessment from that represented by notice previously provided to the owners of Assessed Property pursuant to Sections 3.04 and 3.05 hereof, or (4) an Assessment Roll contains Assessed Property that was not included on the Assessment Roll approved for the prior Fiscal Year, notice shall be provided by first class mail to the Owner of such Assessed Property. Such supplemental notice shall substantially conform with the notice requirements set forth in Section 3.05 hereof and inform the Owner of the date and place for the adoption of the Annual Rate Resolution. The failure of the Owner to receive such supplemental notice due to mistake or inadvertence, shall not affect the validity of the Assessment Roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of a Service Assessment imposed by the City Council pursuant to this Ordinance. 
(D)  The Assessment Roll, as approved by the Annual Rate Resolution, shall be delivered to the Tax Collector, or the Property Appraiser if so directed by the Tax Collector, or if an alternative method is used to collect the Service Assessments, such other official as the City Council by resolution shall designate. If the Service Assessment against any property shall be sustained, reduced, or abated by the City Council, an adjustment shall be made on the Assessment Roll. 
Section 3.09. - Interim Service Assessments. 
(A)  An interim Service Assessment may be imposed against all property, for which a Building Permit is issued, after adoption of the Annual Rate Resolution. The amount of the interim Service Assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth of the annual rate for such property computed in accordance with the Annual Rate Resolution for the Fiscal Year for which the interim Service Assessment is being imposed. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the Fiscal Year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim Service Assessment may also include an estimate of the subsequent Fiscal Year's Service Assessment. No Building Permit shall be issued until full payment of the interim Service Assessment is received by the City. Issuance of the Building Permit without the payment in full of the interim Service Assessment shall not relieve the Owner of such property of the obligation of full payment. Any interim Service Assessment not collected prior to the issuance of the Building Permit may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act as provided in Section 6.01 of this Ordinance or by any other method authorized by law. Any interim Service Assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the Building Permit was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved and shall be deemed perfected upon the issuance of the Building Permit. 
(B)  In the event a Building Permit expires prior to completion of the Building for which it was issued, and the applicant paid the interim Service Assessment at the time the Building Permit was issued, the applicant may within 90 days of the expiration of the Building Permit apply for a refund of the interim Service Assessment. Failure to timely apply for a refund of the interim Service Assessment shall waive any right to a refund. 
(C)  The application for refund shall be filed with the City and contain the following: 
(1)  The name and address of the applicant; 
(2)  The location of the property and the tax parcel identification number for the property which was the subject of the Building Permit; 
(3)  The date the interim Service Assessment was paid; 
(4)  A copy of the receipt of payment for the interim Service Assessment; and 
(5)  The date the Building Permit was issued and the date of expiration. 
(D)  After verifying that the Building Permit has expired and that the Building has not been completed, the City shall refund the interim Service Assessment paid for such Building. 
(E)  A Building Permit which is subsequently issued for a Building on the same property which was subject of a refund shall pay the interim Service Assessment as required by this Section 3.09.

Failure to adopt an Annual Assessment Resolution during the budget adoption process for a Fiscal Year may be cured at any time. 
(B)  In the event that the uniform method of collection provided for in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act is used and (1) the proposed Capital Assessment for any Fiscal Year exceeds the Maximum Assessment Rate included in notice previously provided to the Owners of Assessed Property pursuant to Sections 4.04 and 4.05 hereof, (2) the method of apportionment is changed or the purpose for which the Capital Assessment is imposed is substantially changed from that represented by notice previously provided to the Owners of Assessed Property pursuant to Sections 4.04 and 4.05 hereof, (3) Assessed Property is reclassified in a manner which results in an increased Capital Assessment from that represented by notice previously provided to the owners of Assessed Property pursuant to Sections 4.04 and 4.05 hereof, or (4) an Assessment Roll contains Assessed Property that was not included on the Assessment Roll approved for the prior Fiscal Year, notice shall be provided by first class mail to the Owner of such Assessed Property.

(B)  The amount of an Assessment to be collected using the Uniform Assessment Collection Act for any specific parcel of benefitted property may include an amount equivalent to the payment delinquency, delinquency fees and recording costs for a prior year's assessment for a comparable service, facility, program, or Local Improvement provided, (1) the collection method used in connection with the prior year's assessment did not employ the use of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, (2) notice is provided to the Owner, and (3) any lien on the affected parcel for the prior year's assessment is supplanted and transferred to such Assessment upon certification of a non-ad valorem roll to the Tax Collector by the City.

    In lieu of utilizing the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the City may elect to collect the Assessments by any other method which is authorized by law.

(D)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein.

(E)  As an alternative to the foregoing, an Assessment imposed against Government Property may be collected on the bill for any utility service provided to such Government Property. The City Council may contract for such billing services with any utility not owned by the City. 
ARTICLE VII. - ISSUANCE OF OBLIGATIONS 

Section 7.01. - General authority. 
(A)  Upon adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution imposing Capital Assessments to fund a Local Improvement or at any time thereafter, the City Council shall have the power and is hereby authorized to provide by resolution, at one time or from time to time in series, for the issuance of Obligations to fund the Project Cost thereof. 
(B)  If issued, the principal of and interest on each series of Obligations shall be payable from Pledged Revenue. At the option of the City Council, the City may agree, by resolution, to budget and appropriate funds to make up any deficiency in the reserve account established for the Obligations or in the payment of the Obligations, from other non-ad valorem revenue sources. The City Council may also provide, by resolution, for a pledge of or lien upon proceeds of such non-ad valorem revenue sources for the benefit of the holders of the Obligations. Any such resolution shall determine the nature and extent of any pledge of or lien upon proceeds of such non-ad valorem revenue sources. 
Section 7.02. - Terms of the obligations. 
    If issued, the Obligations shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, shall mature at such times as may be determined by resolution of the City Council, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the City, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions, all as may be fixed by the City Council. Said Obligations shall mature not later than 40 years after their issuance. The City Council shall determine by resolution the form of the Obligations, the manner of executing such Obligations, and shall fix the denominations of such Obligations, the place or places of payment of the principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or outside of the State of Florida, and such other terms and provisions of the Obligations as it deems appropriate. The Obligations may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices as the City Council shall determine by resolution.

Section 7.03. - Variable rate obligations. 
    At the option of the City Council, Obligations may bear interest at a variable rate. 
Section 7.04. - Temporary obligations. 
    Prior to the preparation of definitive Obligations of any series, the City Council may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary Obligations, exchangeable for definitive Obligations when such Obligations have been executed and are available for delivery. The City Council may also provide for the replacement of any Obligations which shall become mutilated, destroyed or lost. Obligations may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this Ordinance. 
Section 7.05. - Anticipation notes. 
    In anticipation of the sale of Obligations, the City Council may, by resolution, issue notes and may renew the same from time to time. Such notes may be paid from the proceeds of the Obligations, the proceeds of the Capital Assessments, the proceeds of the notes and such other legally available moneys as the City Council deems appropriate by resolution. Said notes shall mature within five years of their issuance and shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding the maximum rate provided by law. The City Council may issue Obligations or renewal notes to repay the notes. The notes shall be issued in the same manner as the Obligations. 
Section 7.06. - Taxing power not pledged. 
    Obligations issued under the provisions of this Ordinance shall not be deemed to constitute a general obligation or pledge of the full faith and credit of the City within the meaning of the Constitution of the State of Florida, but such Obligations shall be payable only from Pledged Revenue in the manner provided herein and by the resolution authorizing the Obligations. The issuance of Obligations under the provisions of this Ordinance shall not directly or indirectly obligate the City to levy or to pledge any form of ad valorem taxation whatever therefore. No holder of any such Obligations shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the ad valorem taxing power on the part of the City to pay any such Obligations or the interest thereon or to enforce payment of such Obligations or the interest thereon against any property of the City, nor shall such Obligations constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the City, except the Pledged Revenue. 
Section 7.07. - Trust funds. 
    The Pledged Revenue received pursuant to the authority of this Ordinance shall be deemed to be trust funds, to be held and applied solely as provided in this Ordinance and in the resolution authorizing issuance of the Obligations. Such Pledged Revenue may be invested by the City, or its designee, in the manner provided by the resolution authorizing issuance of the Obligations. The Pledged Revenue upon receipt thereof by the City shall be subject to the lien and pledge of the holders of any Obligations or any entity other than the City providing credit enhancement on the Obligations. 
Section 7.08. - Remedies of holders. 
    Any holder of Obligations, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by the resolution authorizing issuance of the Obligations, may, whether at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Florida or granted hereunder or under such resolution, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this part, or by such resolution, to be performed by the City. 
Section 7.09. - Refunding obligations. 
    The City may, by resolution of the City Council, issue Obligations to refund any Obligations issued pursuant to this Ordinance, or any other obligations of the City theretofore issued to finance the Project Cost of a Local Improvement and provide for the rights of the holders hereof. Such refunding Obligations may be issued in an amount sufficient to provide for the payment of the principal of, redemption premium, if any, and interest on the outstanding Obligations to be refunded. If the issuance of such refunding Obligations results in an annual Assessment that exceeds the estimated maximum annual Capital Assessments set forth in the notice provided pursuant to Section 4.05 hereof, the City Council shall provide notice to the affected property owners and conduct a public hearing in the manner required by Article IV of this Ordinance.
