PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the ordinances of the Village of Plainfield of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1973 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Board of Trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1973 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-1 and the second section of Chapter 3 is 3-2. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-1.1, 3-1.2 and 3-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 4 and 5, it will be designated as Chapter 4.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officers and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Vera Krnac, Village Clerk, Ms. Catherine Jania, Deputy Village Clerk, Mr. Jim Harvey, Village Attorney, and the President and Board of Trustees, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the Village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the Village's affairs.

Sec. 2-4. - Administrative citations. 
(a)  Defined. An administrative citation is a charging instrument utilized by the village to administratively process certain violations of the Code. 
(b)  Use and form generally. In lieu of filing a complaint in court, administrative citations may be issued on behalf of the village by a sworn police officer, community service officer, code enforcement officer and/or building department official for those violations of the Code identified on the village's administrative fee schedule described in subparagraph (c) below. An administrative citation shall be in the form of a "P-ticket" and shall advise the recipient of the section of the Code allegedly violated, and identify (i) the initial payment date for settlement of the claim; (ii) where payment can be made; (iii) the procedure to request a court date; and (iv) that failure to timely remit payment or request a court date shall result in an increase in the settlement amount as described in subparagraph (f) below. 
(c)  Issuance of administrative citation. Per the discretion of any police officer, community service officer, code enforcement officer and/or building department official of the village, an administrative citation may be issued for those violations of the Code identified on the administrative fee schedule. 
(d)  Administrative fee schedule. The village shall maintain an administrative fee schedule identifying those provisions of the Code for which an administrative citation may be issued and the administrative fee applicable to each such violation. The administrative fee schedule may be amended from time to time by the chief of police or his designee and shall be available to the public on the village's website and at the Plainfield Law Enforcement Center. 
(e)  Administrative fee; payment. When an administrative citation is issued, the recipient of the citation may settle and compromise the violation identified on the citation by remitting payment of the administrative fee applicable to the violation, to the village within ten (10) days of issuance of the citation (the initial pay-by date). Payment shall be made in accordance with the instructions set forth on the citation. 
(f)  Nonpayment of administrative fee. In the event payment of the administrative fee applicable to a citation is not remitted within ten (10) days of the issuance of the administrative citation, the administrative fee applicable to the citation shall, on the eleventh day after issuance of the citation, increase by twenty dollars ($20.00) unless otherwise precluded by law, and the recipient of the citation shall be granted an additional ten (10) days to remit to the village the amount then due and owing for the administrative citation. If payment is not timely remitted within ten (10) days of the issuance and/or mailing of the citation by the village in fact, final notice has been mailed, a final notice period consisting of an additional ten-day period shall ensue to allow the alleged violator a final opportunity to pay the following amounts which shall be accepted as settlement. 
(g)  Complaint or notice to appear if claim not settled; fines and penalties. If the recipient of the citation does not settle the claim within the above-described time periods, a complaint or notice to appear will be issued for the violation and the person shall be subject to the fines and penalties as set forth in the applicable provisions of this Code. 
(h)  Prima facie evidence. The fact that a vehicle illegally operated, parked or otherwise the subject of an administrative citation issued pursuant to this article is registered with the Secretary of State in the name of the alleged violator, shall be considered prima facie evidence that the alleged violator was in control of or was the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation.

DIVISION 1. - INTRODUCTION 

Sec. 2.5-221. - Project background. 
    Street addresses are the location identifiers most widely used by state and local government and the public. Street addresses are critical information for administrative, emergency response, research, marketing, mapping, GIS, routing and navigation, and many other purposes. Because they have evolved over many decades, under the control of thousands of local jurisdictions, in many different record and database formats, and to serve many purposes, different address formats and types pose a number of complex geoprocessing and modeling issues. As a consequence, government agencies struggle with these issues as they seek to integrate large, mission-critical files into master address repositories. 
    The lack of a unified system for address assignment and maintenance limited the practical usage of government address records, and was often the source of serious errors and omissions. These errors resulted in increased operating costs, error recovery costs, and in the case of emergency services, could have affected response times resulting in life/death consequences. During the past few years, some governing agencies within the region have migrated their mapping systems to computer-based geographic information systems (GIS). The GIS mapping systems are being served via desktop, intranet, Internet, and mobile vehicle system applications, and are beginning to replace total reliance upon hard copy maps. This has a major impact upon government addressing systems, as maps are heavily used in the assignment, storage, and access of site addresses. The progression to GIS mapping offers the advantages of rapid access, more efficient update procedures, geo-integration with other relevant computer-based information, and more comprehensive data sharing between agencies. 
    However, almost all such computer-based mapping applications and software programs rely upon the site address as the key locational identifier. When the database supporting that key is incomplete or inaccurate, then the applications are limited in their usefulness, and in some cases, can incur serious problems for their users. A comprehensive, and accurate addressing system can tremendously enhance many aspects of village and county government operations. If integrated with a well-planned computer mapping system the added benefits of geo-referencing and spatial analyses may be realized. 
 Accurate and complete mailing/notification lists. 
 Identification of all properties with a particular political boundary (tax unit district, census block, voter precinct, emergency response area, etc.). 
 Identification of all addresses within a given proximity of geographic and political features or areas, such as, GPS points, sewer districts, village limits, buildings, railroads, landfills, water bodies, etc. 
 Resource allocation by addressed locations. 
 Optimal route planning. 
    The use of consistent address standards shall also serve to enhance the effectiveness of "address matching" procedures used between government agencies. This is a process whereby two (2) or more address lists, or databases, are compared for matches, based upon the address fields. This process is practiced extensively at this time, due to the multitude of address database formats existing throughout the village and county agencies. Resolving the mismatches is typically a tedious and time-consuming process, and generally does not result in a one hundred (100) percent match. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-222. - Project purpose. 
    A related address project has been completed to build and implement a Master Address System to serve the Village of Plainfield. The objective is to develop and maintain a centralized address database; one that is maintained in a consistent manner, and made accessible to governing agencies for Will and Kendall Counties. The database is designed with a geo-referencing component, and is integrated with GIS. 
    The Village of Plainfield's Street Address Committee has contributed to this umbrella project, and to addressing procedures for all village address authors, by setting forth standards and specifications for the assignment of addresses within the village's planning area. These standards are presented here in a street address data standards that has been developed in cooperation with addressing authors within Will and Kendall Counties. The street address data standards de-scribe the addressing grid and schema used for the planning area and sets forth methods to resolve existing address problems. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-223. - Project scope. 
    The project undertaken by the street address committee includes development of the street address data standards for the Village of Plainfield, and a plan for implementation of the standards. The project also includes the design and implementation of the village's master address database to be utilized as a central address database for the village, which shall be linked to all future software to ensure continuity for addressing in all software systems. 
    The street address data standards set forth recommendations for the assignment of site addresses and street names, but do not provide standards for the assignment of postal or mailing addresses. However, both the Plainfield Post Master and Postal Address Management Systems Coordinator were included as members on the street address committee to be inclusive on discussions regarding the street address data standards for the village to ensure that they were consistent with the U.S. Postal Service standards. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-224. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of these standards and guidelines, certain terms are defined. Any word or phrase, which is defined in this section, shall have the meaning assigned to it by this section whenever the word or phrase is used in this article.

Circles shall be named the same as the original roadway but with the proper street type. 
    Collector streets. Streets that empty out neighborhoods and subdivisions to the main arterial roads. 
    Court. A relatively short, uninterrupted street with a single common entrance and exit. Courts usually terminate in a curved a dead-end. 
    Crossing . A roadway that traverses an important feature such as a railroad, or waterway.

DIVISION 2. - STREET ADDRESS COMMITTEE 

Sec. 2.5-251. - History. 
    The Village of Plainfield's Traffic Committee, which was formed in December of 2000, has been the functioning authority for reviewing and approving street names for new development or areas which have been annexed into the village. However, all addressing for the village has been outsourced to consulting engineering firms since 1996, and has not been part of the traffic committee review process. In order to establish an addressing system and approval process in-house, an street address committee has been created to review street name assignment and address/readdress assignment for properties in the village. The GIS manager shall issue addresses for properties, and then shall consult the street address committee for street name and address approval. Members of the street address committee shall include the village GIS manager, village police chief, Plainfield and Oswego Fire District Chiefs, Plainfield Post Master, planning secretary supervisor, water billing supervisor, GIS technician, and Will and Kendall County E911. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-252. - Mission statement. 
    The mission of the Village of Plainfield's Street Address Committee is to develop a plan for the standardization of street names and site addresses throughout the Village of Plainfield's planning area. This plan shall be documented within a street address data standards for use by address authors within the village. The standards must, at a minimum, provide for the following objectives: 
(1)  Describe a way to express the content, applicability, data quality, and accuracy of an address dataset or data element. 
(2)  Codify some commonly used discrete units of address information, referred to as address elements, and thereby provide standardized terminology and definitions to alleviate inconsistencies in the use of address elements and to simplify the documentation process. 
(3)  Provide a consistent and logical scheme for the assignment of street and address elements. 
(4)  Provide a method for documenting the content of address information in order to facilitate street address data exchange. 
(5)  Provide a statement of best practices for street address data content and classification. 
    The street address data standards shall apply to the initial reassignment of existing addresses and shall be designed to accommodate both hard copy and computer means of address data storage. Any interpretation of these standards shall be administered by and left to the discretion of the GIS manager.

Secs. 2.5-253-2.5-275. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - ADDRESS GRID OVERVIEW 

Sec. 2.5-276. - Grid structure. 
    The Village of Plainfield address system is set up on a grid structure. The arterial roads are generally spaced one mile apart throughout most of the village. Occasionally, a natural barrier, such as a river, may break the pattern. The Village of Plainfield's numbering system is based from the starting point intersection at State Street and Madison Street in the City of Chicago extending outwardly to the Village of Plainfield. In the Village of Plainfield, east/west addresses range from 20700 W to 28800 W, and the north/south addresses range from 10200 S to 18400 S. 
    The system defines eight (8) blocks equal to one (1) mile. Each block is approximately six hundred sixty (660) feet long. In addressing there are sixty-six (66) possible numbers per block, consisting of thirty-three (33) odd numbers and thirty-three (33) even numbers each being evenly spaced out every twenty (20) feet. North and west sides of the street have even numbers. South and east sides of the street have odd numbers. 
    The village's grid structure for the addressing atlas includes the entire Plainfield Fire Protection District, Plainfield Police Zones, as well as the full extent of the Village of Plainfield's political boundaries. The origin cell "A01" is located in the northeast corner of the address atlas (see Appendix A). Each grid cell is composed of at least one (1) letter and two (2) numbers. From east to west, the cell numbers increase from 01 to 28, and from north to south the alphabetical letters progress from "A" through "Z". Once each of the alphabetical letters have been used, the lettering continues at the beginning of the alphabet using two (2) of the same alphabetical letters from "AA" to "OO". Each cell represents one page in the atlas and focuses on three (3) blocks for east to west, and two (2) blocks for north to south.

DIVISION 4. - COMPONENTS OF AN ADDRESS 

Sec. 2.5-286. - Address components. 
    A site address shall contain the following components: 
Road Number 
Road Name 
Directional Prefix 
Road Type 
Unit Type * 
Unit Number * 
Sub Unit Type * 
Sub Unit Number * 
Suite Number * 
City Name

    It is important to mention that "site city" and "mailing city" may not be the same. A rural mailing address always contains a city name even though the site location is in an unincorporated area. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06; Ord. No. 2722, § 1, 12-17-07) 
Secs. 2.5-287-2.5-300. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 5. - STANDARD FOR STREET NAME ASSIGNMENT 

Sec. 2.5-301. - Pronunciation. 
    Street names shall be easy to pronounce and read in order for the public, children in particular, to easily speak the street name in an emergency situation. For the same reason, street names with confusing spellings shall likewise be avoided. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-302. - Appropriate. 
    Street names shall not be considered inappropriate in regards to race, color, sex, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, or regarded as generally offensive such as Death Row St., Squaw Ln., or Redskin Rd. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-303. - Confusing or generic streets. 
    Common sense shall be used when selecting street names to avoid implementing confusing or generic names such as the following: 
 Dead End Rd. 
 Gravel Rd. 
 Private St. 
 Cross Rd. 
 Frontage Rd. 
 Scenic Dr. 
 Access Rd. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-304. - Similar sounding streets. 
    Street names shall not duplicate or sound similar to other street names even in cases where the spelling is unique. Pearce and Pierce are not acceptable, nor shall Springdale and Springdell be allowed. It is not acceptable to merely change the street type if the root street name is the same, with the special exceptions of place, circle and court. For example, Oak Road, Oak Lane and Oak Street cannot all be utilized. However, using both Oak Road and Oak Court is acceptable, as long as Oak Court extends from Oak Road. Further explanation of the proper use of place, circle and court are covered in Divisions 6 and 10 of this article. Proposed names shall also be rejected if one of the principal words in the name has already been used several times (i.e. Meadow, View or Wood). 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-305. - Street name length. 
    Street names shall be fourteen (14) characters or less, exclusive of prefixes and suffixes. Spaces between words shall be counted as characters. When the prefix and type are added to a long street name, the letters on the street sign will usually be smaller in appearance. Governments do not normally want to incur the cost to produce a larger street sign to accommodate the long street name. Safety problems can arise due to being able to read smaller letters on a sign. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-306. - Street name spacing. 
    Street names shall be no more than two (2) words and unnecessary spacing in a name shall be avoided. For example, Forestview is much preferred over Forest View. A two-word street name is often compressed into one-word on a street sign to conserve space. This compression often misleads the public into believing that the street sign is the official name. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-307. - Numeric street names. 
    Numeric street names shall be written using numbers rather than spelled out as words. Additionally, numeric street names shall include the TH, RD, ST or ND characters as part of the street name. For example, 3RD shall be used instead of THIRD or 3. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-308. - Abbreviations and punctuation. 
    Street name, type, directional prefix, unit and subunit types shall all be capitalized in the master address database. Elements of a street name shall not be abbreviated with the exception of highways. For example, Mount Vernon and Saint Francis shall be used as official street names instead of Mt. Vernon and St. Francis, regardless of how they appear on plats. For geocoding purposes, all punctuation shall be avoided in street names including periods after abbreviations, hyphens and apostrophes. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-309. - Highway abbreviations. 
    Highway abbreviations shall be inputted as shown below utilizing spaces between words. 
Example Abbreviation Interstate 55 I 55 U.S. Route 30 RT 30 Illinois Route 126 RT 126 Illinois Route 59 RT 59  
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-310. - Geographic directions as part of street names. 
    Geographic directions (north, south, east, west) shall not be used as part of the street name. While these do exist in the Village of Plainfield, such as Northland Street, West Cove Way, Westwind Court, and Eastern Avenue, this practice shall be avoided in future developments. When verbally giving an address such as these, it would be impossible to distinguish between N. Land and Northland for example. 
    Additionally, the adoption of the Chicago Address Grid System in the village allows for only two (2) accepted prefixes: South and west. Therefore, north and east shall not be accepted as directional prefixes in the Village of Plainfield. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-311. - Street types as part of street names. 
    A street type, like a directional prefix, shall be avoided as part of the root street name. For example, a street named Winding Trail Drive is confusing since Trail and Drive are both street types. Country Walk Lane Court is another example where the street type Court was simply added without deleting the type Lane . 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-312. - Street name continuity. 
    Street name continuity is the retention of one street name for the entire length of the street, including streets aligned parallel in adjacent subdivisions. This is not to be confused with street name duplication in which case streets that are not continuous are given the same name. Street name continuity shall be used when possible. Allowances can be made for gaps in a street's continuity as in cases of undeveloped land. However, if a case arises in which street name continuity has been established in two (2) or more subdivisions with a gap of undeveloped land in between, the gap, when developed shall continue that street and street name in its development to establish continuity. If the street shifts off-line by more than two hundred (200) feet, a new street name shall be assigned. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-313. - Street name duplication. 
    Street name duplication shall not be allowed in the Village of Plainfield. However, any new development that may be developed between an undeveloped area and an existing subdivision where a planned street aligns with an existing street in the developed subdivision, shall be allowed to continue the name of that existing street in its development plans. However, in this case, the duplicate street must be parallel to the existing street and may not shift off-line by more than two hundred (200) feet in order to retain the existing street name. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-314. - Development names as street names. 
    Street names shall not reflect the name of a development. Problems arise with implementing continuous street names through other subdivisions when a street name reflects the name of another development. Street names are not marketing tools; their purpose is to enable people to locate addresses readily. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-315. - Verify spelling. 
    Street naming and spelling shall be consistent when an established street continues through a new subdivision. For example, Governour Street established in one subdivision shall not be spelled as Governor Street as it continues in another Subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-316. - Legal and alias street names. 
    Alias street names are other commonly used names for streets. Many streets are known by several different names, such as Pilcher Road is also known as 135th Street, and Lockport Street is also known as Illinois Route 126 and Lockport Road. The name appearing on the recorded subdivision plat map, or street name petition, is usually considered the legal name and used for the situs address. Street names may be changed to a different official name. Any such changes shall be registered in the county recorder of deeds office. Alias street names shall be tracked in the village's master address database for historical and emergency response purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-317. - Village annexations. 
    For arterial streets annexed by the Village of Plainfield, it is understood the name of the street and the addresses shall conform to the Village of Plainfield's naming conventions. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Secs. 2.5-318-2.5-330. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 6. - STANDARD FOR STREET NUMBER ASSIGNMENT 

Sec. 2.5-331. - Address numbers. 
    Address numbers shall consist entirely of numbers. This includes street numbers, unit numbers, subunit numbers, and suite numbers. Characters such as hyphens, alpha-characters, and fractions are not acceptable (i.e. 24560 A-1, 24560A and 245601/2). 
    The address number is a unique numerical identifier based on the address grid. The address number shall be five (5) digits in length. The "10000 Blocks" radiate north-south, and the "20000 Blocks" radiate east-west. The numbering system continues to increase southerly and westerly. In the case where a structure is subdivided into more than one external entry occupancies, a unit type and unit number shall be assigned. Suites shall be assigned for all internal occupancies (i.e. business offices, apartments, and condominiums). Subunit numbers and subunit types shall be assigned in those instances where an additional external unit exists within a unit that also contains suites. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-332. - Address ranges. 
    The possible address range of a street must be identified. It determines which addresses may be given out along the length of the street section. For example, an address number of 23000 shall not be assigned on a block with a potential address range of 22000-22099. In cases where no structures exist on parcels overlapping two (2) blocks, the block with the address range that contains the greater portion of the parcel shall be assigned. In cases where a structure exists on a parcel overlapping two (2) blocks, the block with the address range that contains the greater portion of the structure shall be assigned. In instances where this may cause conflict in address interval assignment, the address range may be left to the discretion of the street address committee for number assignment. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-333. - Address parity. 
    In the Village of Plainfield, even numbers are located on the north and west sides of the street and odd numbers are located on the south and east sides of the street. This is known as address parity. Addresses across the street from one another shall be comparable. If 22515 is used on the odd-numbered side of a street, numbers close to 22514 or 22516 shall be used on the even side. This is not always possible in practice, particularly on curving streets, but it shall be followed as closely as possible. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-334. - Numerical sequence. 
    All existing parcels and structures within the Village of Plainfield shall have a valid numerical address. All new parcels and structures within the village shall be provided with an approved numerical address. The village's GIS manager shall approve the use of all proposed numerical addressing within the village after consultation with the street address committee. 
    Assignment of addresses must be done in numerical sequence along a street. Address numbers shall increase as they move either southerly or westerly from the corresponding point on the address grid and they shall not be assigned out of order. For instance, 16441 shall not fall between 16359 and 16410. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-335. - Address intervals. 
    The GIS manager must consider both current and future development for assigning address numbers. Future growth may make it necessary to insert address numbers between those currently being assigned. Planning shall include a large enough numbering interval to allow for expansion and growth. Even numbered addresses (i.e. 12310, 12314, 12318, etc.) shall be used to identify all lots located on the north and west side of the road. Odd numbered addresses (i.e. 12311, 12315, 12319, etc.) shall be used to identify all lots located on the south and east side of the road. Assignment of address intervals shall be determined upon the number of structures that need to be numbered within each block. Each block shall not exceed sixty-six (66) addresses (thirty-three (33) even and thirty-three (33) odd). 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-336. - Duplicate numbers. 
    No duplicate numbers shall be assigned on a street. This includes addresses on streets that are extensions of a main street (i.e. place, courts and circles). If there is a 12250 S Rock Dr., then there shall not be a 12250 S Rock Ct. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-337. - Long streets. 
    In subdivision developments having long blocks with no intersecting streets, addresses shall correspond with the appropriate address range for each section of the block. The long streets may be trending or diagonal and shall be numbered in the direction of the greatest distance of which the trend or diagonal covers (north/south or east/west). 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-338. - Corner lots. 
    A structure located at the corner of two (2) intersecting streets shall be addressed from the street from which the front door is positioned. A request for a business to be addressed off of a major street shall not be permitted unless the major street borders that property, and the front door is obscured or invisible from the road, or the structure is obviously best reached for emergency purposes by the driveway. In this instance, the street number shall be assigned based on where the driveway intersects the road. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-339. - Courts. 
    A court shall have the same name as the street from which it branches (See Figure 1). If the court exceeds the length outlined in the village's subdivision ordinance, it shall be given a unique street name and numbered accordingly (See Figure 2). However, in the case where more than one court branches off the same street, each court shall have a different street name then the street from which it branches. In each of the cases listed above, the street type classification for each of the courts shall be court . On the contrary, if a court is less than the length outlined in the village's subdivision ordinance for a court , it shall retain the street name, street numbering sequence, and street type designation of the main street. In other words, if it is not a true court , the street shall not be labeled as a court (See Figure 3). 
    The numbering pattern for courts shall follow the numbering pattern, interval, and direction from the Village's address grid system and shall not continue from the street from which it branches. Likewise, in the case where there is more than one (1) court off the same street, each court shall follow the address interval relative to its location on the address grid system with no courts duplicating address intervals from the other courts . In other words, in this instance, no court shall be assigned the same address. Courts shall have the even and Figure 1 odd address numbers meet at the closed end of the street.

Figure 3 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-340. - Circles. 
    A circle is defined as a court that terminates at the end of a street. The name, numbering pattern, interval and direction are continued from the street on which the circle stems. The street type classification Circle may be used to name the entire street, or it may be used to name the court portion of the street only if there is a natural breaking point, such as an intersecting street that may separate and distinguish the two (2) sections (See Figure 4). Circles shall be numbered like any regular street and have the even and odd address numbers meet at the closed end of the street. 

Figure 4 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-341. - Closed loop. 
    If a street forms a closed loop , addressing shall proceed clockwise from the base of the loop of the street from which it branches. Closed loops shall be numbered like any regular street and shall have the even and odd address numbers meet at the closed end of the loop. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-342. - Crescents. 
    A crescent is defined as a street that intersects at two (2) points from the same collector street. Crescent streets are numbered consecutively starting from one point and terminating at the second point. The street numbers for this street configuration shall not be assigned consecutively from the street from which it extends. Instead, the street numbers shall be assigned according to the direction in which it covers the greatest distance being north/south or east/west. Likewise, odd numbers shall be located on the south and east sides of the street, with even numbers on the north and west sides of the street (See Figure 5). 

Figure 5 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-343. - Streets that change direction. 
    For streets that change direction, the street shall retain its original address grid and range throughout its entire length no matter how many times the roadway turns or bends (See Figure 6). In the instance where the street curve shifts at a 90-degree angle changing the major direction of the street, it may be acceptable to assign a new street name (See Figure 7). However, streets with more than one (1) curve may not follow this exception as it may produce a hidden street. Likewise, this method shall not be used if the second section of street at the 90-degree angle is very short.

Figure 7 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-344. - Vanity street names. 
    A vanity street is a street named after a company, corporation, individual, etc., usually as a condition of a land dedication. If vanity street names are used, their numbering shall be consistent with the address grid. Acme Company shall not use "Number One Acme Drive" as their address but must be numbered according to the established address range. In addition, vanity street names shall not be allowed for only a segment of a street, but if used must be used for the entire street length (See Figure 8). 

Figure 8 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-345. - Vacant parcels and theoretical addresses. 
    Most jurisdictions do not assign an official address to a vacant land parcel until a building permit has been issued for new construction. Often though, an unofficial address will be pre-assigned as a guide. For example, theoretical addresses are usually assigned to the lots in approved residential subdivisions before new homes are built. For geographic information systems (GIS) referencing purposes an unofficial address shall be assigned to each existing parcel even if the address is theoretical and could change when a building permit is issued. If a large vacant parcel occupies an entire block it would normally be given a theoretical address in the middle of the corresponding thousand block range. For example, a vacant parcel on the even side of the 12000 block would be addressed as 12050 rather than 12000 or 12002. Sometimes a very large parcel, such as in a rural setting, will reside in more than one thousand block range. Like the previous example, the unofficial address shall be about halfway between the ranges. If the parcel occupies two (2) blocks, such as between 17000-19000, it would be given an address of 18000. This will allow for the parcel to be subdivided later and still have sequential address numbers. An unofficial address on a vacant parcel may be altered by any new addresses assigned by a building permit. This would be in cases where the expected pattern of development for a vacant parcel shall require different or additional addresses. General address standards would then apply. However, whenever possible, the unofficial address shall be issued as the official address on the building permit. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-346. - Single family residential development. 
(a)  All residential subdivision developments shall be assigned one development or project address as approved by the village. This address shall be the same as the existing parcel address maintained in the master address database, or shall be assigned another address if the parcel is to be subdivided. This address shall be used to identify the property until the street address committee approves addresses for each individual lot within the subdivision. After the subdivision has been fully developed, the theoretical address shall no longer be used, but shall be listed as a historical address in the master address database. 
(b)  Sales, construction, and other miscellaneous structures and trailers used during the construction of projects shall use the project address assigned to the development. All temporary structures and trailers shall be assigned a designated unit number approved by the village. Temporary unit numbers shall be numerical in sequence (100, 101, 102, 103 etc....) based upon the order in which the structures are placed on the project site. 
(c)  Each proposed lot within a single family residential development shall be assigned one numerical address. However, no lot shall use the theoretical or existing parcel address. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-347. - Duplexes and townhomes. 
    Duplexes and townhomes shall be assigned individual street numbers for each residence following the appropriate numbering pattern, interval and direction stipulated for individual lots. In cases where duplexes and townhomes are perpendicular to the street from which it is being addressed from, street numbering shall be left to the discretion of the GIS manager. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-348. - Stacked addresses. 
    Houses or trailers behind or next to other houses or trailers sharing a common driveway shall be given separate street numbers. Assign the first possible number to the front house and the second number to the next house, etc. If the structures are next to each other, numbering shall continue in sequence. This is much preferred over the use of hyphenated, alphanumeric, or fractional numbering (i.e., 12437-2, 12437B, 124371/2). 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-349. - Commercial development-Single building projects. 
(a)  The theoretical address or development address shall be used for the proposed structure if the proposed structure frontage faces the street used to address the project. If the proposed structure frontage faces in the opposite direction, a new structure address shall be assigned. 
(b)  If the development site is to be subdivided, a new address number shall be assigned for the proposed structure and it shall be consistent with the range of addresses found along the street or road in which they face. In this case, the theoretical address shall not be used, but shall be listed as a historical address in the village's master address database for each of the presubdivided properties. 
(c)  Unoccupied accessory structures such as storage buildings and fire pump buildings shall not be assigned a numerical address. 
(d)  Sales, construction, and other miscellaneous structures and trailers used during the construction of projects shall use the project address assigned to the development. All temporary structures and trailers shall be assigned a designated unit number approved by the village. Temporary unit numbers shall be numerical in sequence (100, 101, 102, 103 etc....) based upon the order in which the structures are placed on the project site. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-350. - Commercial development-Multi building complexes. 
(a)  One development or project address shall be assigned to the new project by using the address of the parcel the project shall be located on. This address shall be the same as the existing parcel address maintained in the master address database, or shall be assigned another address if the parcel is to be subdivided. This address shall be used to identify the property until the street address committee approves addresses for each individual structure on the development or project site. 
(b)  Commercial projects shall be assigned an individual numerical address for each occupied structure on the site. Address numbers shall be consistent with the range of addresses found along the street or road in which they face. Each structure shall be assigned numbers in sequence by tens (10's) if the address range and number of proposed structures allows for it; otherwise numbers shall be assigned utilizing the best fitting sequence scheme available. Unoccupied accessory structures such as storage buildings and fire pump buildings shall not be assigned a numerical address. 
(c)  When assigning individual structure or lot addresses to the project, the original development address shall not be used for any of the occupied structures or lots. Instead, it shall be listed as an historical address in the master address database. 
(d)  Sales, construction, and other miscellaneous structures and trailers used during the construction of projects shall use the project address assigned to the development. All temporary structures and trailers shall be assigned a designated unit number approved by the village. Temporary unit numbers shall be numerical in sequence (100, 101, 102, 103, etc....) based upon the order in which the structures are placed on the project site. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-351. - Parks. 
    Parks shall be assigned one numerical address in the proper numerical sequence for the area. 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-352. - Size of street numbers. 
(a)  Size and location. The figures used by owners or occupants of each building to identify the street address of that building shall be plainly visible from the middle of the street, shall not be less than four and a half (4.5) inches high, and shall be located in a conspicuous place immediately over or by the side of the main street entrance to the building, or conspicuously displayed on the mailbox located at and applicable to the property. 
(b)  Color and maintenance. Such numbers shall be of such color as to clearly contrast with the portion of the structure on which the numbers are affixed. The owners or occupants of each building shall maintain all numbers affixed to their respective building. 
(c)  Form. Such numbers shall not be of script form. 
(Ord. No. 2611, § I, 1-8-07; Ord. No. 2722, § 1, 12-17-07) 
Sec. 2.5-353. - Penalties. 
(a)  Failure to number. The owner or occupant of any store, residence or other building now erected, or which may hereafter be erected within the village, who fails to comply with the provisions of this article, shall be fined not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for a first offense, not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) for the second offense, and not less than seventy-five dollars ($75.00) for any subsequent offense. Each day any violation of this section shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
(b)  Defacing numbers. Any person who shall willfully deface or remove any number placed upon any building in conformity with this article shall be fined not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each offense.

(b)  Each exterior door in a shopping center or strip mall shall be assigned an individual unit number. Businesses that may occupy more than one (1) unit shall clearly display the unit number either on the main entry door or next to the main entry door to the business. The door used as a secondary door for the business shall be assigned a unit number, however, it will be listed as a non-active address in the master address database and shall not be utilized by the current occupant. To avoid confusion, non-active units shall not be labeled on or next to the doorway. In the case where there is a change in occupancy for a unit with a non-active unit number, the unit number shall become active and utilized by the new tenant. 
(c)  Units shall be assigned a three-digit unit number as outlined in section 2.5-376(a). 
(d)  Unit numbers shall be numbered in the order that they are viewed from the front of the structure increasing in range from the left side to the right side of the structure. In those cases where the front entrance of a structure is located on the north or west side of the street it is being addressed from, the units shall be given even unit numbers. In those cases where the front entrance of a structure is located on the south or east side of the street it is being addressed from, the units shall be given odd unit numbers. 
(e)  Unit numbers shall be assigned in sequence by a minimum of twos (2's). 
(Ord. No. 2598, § II(Exh. A), 12-6-06) 
Sec. 2.5-378. - Businesses. 
    All multiple tenant structures shall be provided with an approved unit or suite number to identify the individual tenant space. The process for approving proposed unit or suite numbers shall be in accordance with the following criteria: 
(1)  Business structures with tenant spaces having exterior entrances shall be assigned unit numbers and shall follow the unit number assignment process as outlined for shopping centers and strip malls in section 2.5-377(b), (c) and (d) of this ordinance. 
(2)  Business structures with tenant spaces having interior entrances shall be assigned suite numbers and shall follow the suite number assignment process as outlined for apartments and condominiums in section 2.5-376(a) and (c) of this ordinance. 
(3)  Business structures with interior tenants without doorways or closed spaces shall not be addressed with a suite number. This instance commonly occurs in gas stations with donut or coffee shops with businesses located on the interior of the structure. In this case, the suite number type shall be classified as "Open" in the master address database. 
(4)  Each business tenant space (interior or exterior entries) shall be assigned numbers in sequence by a minimum of twos (2's). 
(5)  One-story business structures shall have addresses within the 100 series. Multiple story business structures shall be assigned addresses by floor served (100, 200, 300, 400, etc) and as outlined for apartments and condominiums in section 2.5-376(a).

Sec. 2.5-401. - Appurtenances and utility assets. 
    Addressing for the following list of appurtenances and utility assets in the Village of Plainfield shall be assigned as stated below: 
Cable Panel Vaults 
Electric Meters 
Electric Pedestals 
Electric Panel Vaults 
Electric Power Poles 
Electric Reader Boards 
Hydrants 
Monument Signs 
Stormwater Outfalls 
Telephone Panel Vaults 
Utility Sheds 
Wastewater Services 
Water Backflows 
Water Irrigation Meters 
Water Service 
    Address assignment for the above listed appurtenances/assets shall use the existing valid situs or, if available, secondary situs address of the parcel the appurtenance shall be located on. To assist field staff with locating the appurtenance in the field, all asset information entered into village data systems shall include the valid situs/secondary address and in addition, a brief description of where the appurtenance is located on the parcel. 
    Exceptions to the above exist for the following: 
(1)  Appurtenances located on the property line between parcels. For appurtenances located directly on the property line between parcels, either one of the immediately adjacent parcel addresses may be used if both parcels are addressed off the same frontage street.

DIVISION 12. - ADDRESSING PROCEDURE 

Sec. 2.5-476. - Changing address numbers. 
    It shall be the policy of this ordinance to discourage the practice of changing existing addresses or address numbers which are already in use except:

(2)  If the existing number is such that the assignment of address numbers for new structures is not practical and in keeping with the requirements. 
(3)  When a new street is constructed, or recognized, which results in the most appropriate address for a structure to be on the new street rather than the original street such as where a structure is previously on land locked property and for example, then has a new street built to service it. 
(4)  If it is determined that an address needs to be changed for safety and emergency purposes. 
 Number is out of proper sequence. 
 Number series presently in use is incorrect or misleading.

(1)  The grantee has substantially complied with material terms of the existing franchise and with applicable law;

(c)  Impoundment: Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe a vehicle is subject to impoundment pursuant to this article, the police officer shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility authorized by the village. Before or at the time the vehicle is towed, the police officer shall notify any person identifying himself as the owner of the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, of the fact of the impoundment of the vehicle and of the owner's right to request a preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing to be conducted under this article. Said vehicle shall be impounded pending the completion of the hearings provided for in the following subsections, unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the village a cash bond in a form of payment acceptable to the village in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) and pays all towing and storage charges for the vehicle. 
(d)  Towing and storage charges: The cost for towing a motor vehicle impounded pursuant to this article shall be that approved by the chief of police for all tow companies authorized to tow for the police department. The cost for storage of a motor vehicle impounded pursuant to this article shall be thirty dollars ($30.00) per day.

(e)  Appeal; preliminary hearing: If the owner of record of a vehicle seized and impounded pursuant to this article desires to appeal the impoundment, said owner must make a request for a preliminary impoundment hearing within forty-eight (48) hours of the impoundment. Said request shall be in writing and filed with the chief of police or his designee, who shall conduct such a preliminary hearing within two (2) business days of receipt of the owner's request for the hearing. For purposes of this article, "business days" shall mean Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after the hearing, the chief of police or his designee determines there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to impoundment pursuant to this article, he shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this article, unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the village an administrative fee in a form of payment acceptable to the village in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00), and pays all applicable towing and storage fees. If the chief or police or his designee determines there is no such probable cause, the vehicle will be released without penalty or payment of other fees. 
(f)  Notification of hearing: Within ten (10) business days after a vehicle is impounded pursuant to this article, the village shall notify the owner of record, lessee and lienholder, by first class mail or personal service at the address registered with the Secretary of State, of the date, time, and location of a hearing that will be conducted, pursuant to this article. If a plea of guilty is entered, the case will be disposed of at that time. If a plea of not guilty is entered, a final hearing may be scheduled and held. The village administrator shall appoint a hearing officer to preside over the final hearing, which hearing officer must be an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Illinois for a minimum of three (3) years and be in good standing with the Illinois Attorney Disciplinary and Registration Committee. The hearing officer shall be empowered and is hereby authorized and directed to: 
(1)  Preside over the final hearing as the adjudicator; 
(2)  Administer oaths; 
(3)  Issue subpoenas to secure the attendance of witnesses and production of relevant documentation; 
(4)  Hear testimony and accept evidence that is relevant to the basis of the impoundment or seizure; 
(5)  Assess fines and penalties as established by this Code; 
(6)  Make final determinations of violation liability; and 
(7)  Provide for an accurate recordation of the final hearing. 
All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. At any time prior to the hearing date, the hearing officer may, at the request of either party, direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. In a hearing on the propriety of impoundment of a vehicle any sworn or affirmed report that: 1) is prepared in the performance of a law enforcement officer's duties and 2) sufficiently describes the circumstances leading to the impoundment, shall be admissible evidence of the vehicle owner's liability, unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used in connection with a violation set forth in this article, the hearing officer shall enter a written order finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the village for an administrative penalty in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) and requiring the vehicle to continue to be impounded until the owner pays the administrative penalty to the village and all towing and storage charges due for the vehicle. If the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a written default order in favor of the village. If the hearing officer finds that no such violation occurred, the hearing officer shall issue a written order for the immediate return of the owner's vehicle or cash bond without fees. All final decisions of the administrative hearing officer shall be subject to review under the provisions of the Illinois Administrative Review Law, 735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq. 
(g)  Payment: If an administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to this article, such penalty shall constitute a debt due and owing to the village. If a cash bond has been posted pursuant to this article, the bond shall be applied to the penalty. If a vehicle has been impounded when such a penalty is imposed, the village may seek to obtain a judgment on the debt and enforce such judgment against the vehicle as provided by law. Except as provided otherwise in this article, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until the penalty is paid to the village and any applicable towing and storage fees are paid in full, in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle or the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment to enforce a lien as provided by law. If the administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within thirty (30) days after an administrative penalty is imposed against an owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the hearing, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases, if the administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within thirty (30) days after the expiration of time at which administrative review of the hearing officer's determination may be sought, or within thirty (30) days after an action seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor of the village, whichever is applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles under the Illinois Vehicle Code. 
(h)  Possession of vehicle: 
(1)  Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner, lien holder, or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under this article until the administrative penalty and fees applicable under this article have been paid. However, whenever a person with a lien of record against an impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given to that person if he or she agrees in writing to refund to the village the amount of the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all lien holders of record, not to exceed the administrative penalty, plus the applicable fees. 
(2)  The provisions of this article authorizing an owner or other party to regain possession of a motor vehicle are not applicable when vehicle or asset forfeiture proceedings have been instituted under state or federal drug asset forfeiture laws or Article 36 of the Illinois Criminal Code of 1961. In such case, the village shall not release, or dispose of, the vehicle to any person except as consistent with those proceedings. 
(3)  In the event the village's police department determines that the vehicle impounded pursuant to this article should not be released to its owner or other persons, or disposed of as an unclaimed vehicle, due to the need to retain the vehicle as part of a continuing criminal investigation, or as evidence in a crime, then the village shall notify the owner that the vehicle will be retained and not released except as required by law. 
(4)  For purposes of this article, the "owner" or "owner of record" of a vehicle is the record title holder as registered with the Illinois Secretary of State or applicable agency for a foreign jurisdiction. When in this article the word "owner" or "owner of record" is used it shall apply to all owners. This article presumes that all owners have equal rights to an impounded vehicle. In instances of multiple owners of a vehicle, the village shall not have a duty or responsibility to inquire or determine whether all owners concur with, or object to, any action taken, or omissions by any one (1) owner in relation to the impounded vehicle.

Upon being satisfied by affidavits or other sworn evidence that a nuisance exists, the court may without notice or bond enter a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to enjoin any defendant from maintaining such nuisance and may enter an order restraining any defendant from removing or interfering with all property used in connection with the nuisance. 
(f)  Procedure; notice. When the chief of police receives two (2) reports documenting the occurrence of nuisance activity on or within a property, he shall independently review such reports to determine whether they describe any violations identified in paragraph (b) above. If the chief of police determines that the reports document the occurrence of nuisance activity, he may: 
(1)  Provide written notification to the owner or person in charge that the property is in danger of becoming a chronic nuisance property. Such notice shall be provided by either personal service or by certified mail, addressed to the owner of the property and the person in charge at the address of the subject property, and also at such other address as may be shown on the tax rolls of the county in which the property is located. The notice shall contain the following: 
(i)  The street address or a legal description sufficient for identification of the property; 
(ii)  A statement that the chief of police has information that the property may constitute a chronic nuisance property as defined by this article, with a concise description of the alleged nuisance activities that exist or have occurred. The chief of police shall offer the owner or person in charge an opportunity to propose within ten (10) days a course of action for the immediate abatement of the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation and/or demand that the owner or person in charge respond to the chief of police within ten (10) days to discuss the alleged nuisance activities. 
(2)  After complying with the notification procedures described herein and upon receipt by the chief of police of a report documenting the occurrence of a third nuisance activity at or within a property and determining that the property has become a chronic nuisance property, the chief of police shall provide written notice to the owner and person in charge that the property has been determined to be a chronic nuisance property. Such notice shall be provided in the same manner described in subsection (f)(1) above, and also shall be posted at the property after ten (10) days has elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice and the owner and/or person in charge has failed to contact the chief of police. The notice shall contain the following information: 
(i)  The street address or a legal description sufficient for identification of the property; 
(ii)  A statement that the chief of police has determined the property to be a chronic nuisance property as defined by this article, with a concise description of the alleged nuisance activities that exist or have occurred and form the basis of his findings; and 
(iii)  A demand that the owner and/or person in charge respond within ten (10) days to the chief of police and propose a course of action to abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation. 
(3)  If after the notification, but prior to the commencement of legal proceedings by the village pursuant to this article, a person in charge or owner stipulates with the chief of police that they will pursue a course of action the parties agree will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation, the chief of police may agree to postpone legal proceedings for a period of not less than ten (10) nor more than thirty (30) days, except in the case of a nuisance activity as provided for herein where a search warrant was executed at the property. If the agreed course of action does not result in the abatement of the nuisance activity or if no agreement concerning abatement is reached within thirty (30) days, the chief of police shall request authorization for the corporation counsel to commence a legal proceeding to abate the nuisance. 
(g)  Failure to receive notice; response. The failure of any person to receive notice that a property may be a chronic nuisance property shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the proceedings under this article. 
(h)  No admission. When a person in charge responds to the chief of police as required above, any conduct or statements made in connection with that response shall not constitute an admission that any nuisance activities have or are occurring. This paragraph does not preclude the admission of any evidence otherwise admissible or offered for any other purpose. 
(i)  Defense. It is a defense to any such action that the owner of the subject property could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that it had become a public nuisance, or could not, despite the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct resulting in the property being deemed a chronic nuisance property as provided for herein. It shall also be a defense for an owner, prior to the notification provided for in this article to, in good faith, notify a law enforcement agency of suspected illegal activity and to commence an eviction action against any tenant or occupant of the property. 
(j)  Civil penalty. In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court may consider any factors relevant to the violation(s), including but not limited to: 
(1)  The action or lack of action taken by an owner or person in charge to mitigate or correct the violations at the property; 
(2)  The continuous or repetitive nature of the violation(s); 
(3)  The knowledge of the owner or person in charge of the activities or conditions of the property constituting a violation of this article and their acquiescence in permitting the violation(s) to occur; 
(4)  The magnitude or gravity of the violation(s); 
(5)  The cooperation of the owner or person in charge with the village; and 
(6)  The cost incurred by the village to investigate, correct or attempt to correct the violation(s). 
(k)  Emergency closing procedure. If it is determined that the property is an immediate threat to public safety and welfare, the village may apply to the court for such interim relief as deemed appropriate by the chief of police. In such event, the notice provisions provided in this article shall not apply, however the village shall use its best efforts to notify the owner or person in charge of the property prior to a hearing before the court. In the event the court finds the property to be a chronic nuisance property, the court may order any available remedy, including but not limited to an emergency closing of the property, and may order the village to physically secure the property against use or occupancy should the owner or person in charge fail to do so within the time specified by the court. 
(l)  Lien; notice and release. All costs reasonably incurred by the village to affect the property closure and/or to otherwise abate any public nuisance under this article, shall be assessed as a lien against the property. Any person against whom such costs are assessed shall be personally liable to the village for the payment thereof. In the event any cost incurred by the village to affect the property closure and/or to otherwise abate any public nuisance is not paid by the liable party, the village shall have a lien on the property for such costs. The village shall file a notice of lien in the office of the recorder of deeds of the county where the property is located. Upon payment of the cost(s) by the liable party, the village shall cause a release of lien to be recorded in said recorder's office. 
(m)  Severability. If any provision, clause or paragraph of this article shall be held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such validity shall not affect the other provisions of this article. 
(n)  Other remedies. The adoption of this article does not preclude the village from using other lawful methods to enforce the provisions of this Code.

(a)  [Generally.] It shall be a violation of this article for any person under the age of eighteen (18) who is enrolled in a public, private, or parochial school to absent himself from attendance at such school without the permission of his legal guardian(s) or parent(s).

Sec. 6-230. - Use or possession of electronic paging and cellular radio telecommunications devices. 
(a)  Findings. The village board takes official notice that the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities is a fundamental goal of the people of Illinois, and finds and declares that to further such goal it is essential to provide a safe and secure learning environment within the public schools, and that the unrestricted and unregulated use by students of cellular radio telecommunications devices, pocket pagers and similar electronic paging devices (hereinafter "telecommunications devices") on school grounds or in school buildings which are owned, occupied or leased for school purposes and activities adversely affects the educational environment, welfare and safety of students enrolled in schools, in that telecommunications devices are being regularly used for the conduct of unlawful activities during school hours and on school property, including activities directly related to the unlawful possession, sale, delivery of [or] other trafficking in drugs or other substances which constitute a "controlled substance" as that term is defined in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act. 
    It is the purpose and intention of the village board, in enacting this section, to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of such unlawful activities during school instruction or during hours of school activities and on school property by restricting and regulating student use or possession of telecommunications devices as provided in this section, and by providing for the imposition of appropriate penalty for any violation of the provisions of this section. 
(b)  Restrictions on possession. No person under the age of twenty-one (21) shall use or have in his or her possession any telecommunications device while in any school building or on any school property, during regular school hours or at any other time, unless the use or possession of such device by such person has first been expressly authorized by the school authorities. However, a person who is not a student of the particular elementary or secondary school who is on school property as an invitee of the school and who has possession of a telecommunications device for lawful and legitimate purposes shall not need to obtain authority from the elementary or secondary school authorities to possess such device on school property. 
(c)  Penalty: 
(1)  Fine. Any person who violates this section shall be fined not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). 
(2)  Forfeiture. In lieu of or in addition to any fine assessed for a violation, the court may order that any telecommunications device used or possessed in violation of this section be forfeited and delivered to any local, municipal, county or state law enforcement agency.

When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-IL, WSP-2, or a dynamic model such as HIP. The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-I, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. Flood flows should be based on anticipated future land use conditions in the watershed as determined from adopted local and regional land use plans. Along any watercourses draining more than one (1) square mile, the above analyses shall be submitted to DWR for approval, once approved it must be submitted to the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository for filing. For a nonriverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus three (3) feet, unless calculated by a detailed engineering study and approved by the Illinois State Water Survey.

(c)  Preventing increased damages. No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety. 
(1)  If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the flood plain. 
(2)  Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a flood plain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and one-half (11/2) times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All flood plain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All flood plain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
A recorded covenant running with the land is required to maintain the compensatory storage volume in areas modified to provide compensatory storage volume.

(2)  The village administrator shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state, and federal permits and approvals that may be required for this type of activity. The village administrator shall not issue the development permit unless all required federal and state permits have been obtained. A registered professional engineer, under the employ or contract of the village shall review and approve applications reviewed under this section. 
(c)  Preventing increased damages and a list of appropriate uses. 
(1)  The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this ordinance. Only those appropriate uses listed in 92 Illinois Administrative Code 708 will be allowed. Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an appropriate use. The approved appropriate uses are as follows: 
a.  Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife. 
b.  Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities, and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water depended uses. 
c.  Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls. 
d.  Underground and overhead utilities. 
e.  Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems including any related fencing (at least fifty (50) percent open when viewed from any one (1) direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions. 
f.  Detached garages, storage sheds, or other non-habitable accessory structures without toilet facilities to existing buildings that will not block flood flows, nor reduce floodway storage. 
g.  Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any modification thereto. 
h.  Parking lots and any modifications thereto (where depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed one (1) foot) and aircraft parking aprons built at or below ground elevation. 
i.  Regulatory floodway re-grading, without fill, to create a positive non-erosive slope toward a watercourse. 
j.  Flood proofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the construction of water tight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than ten (10) feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure. 
k.  In the case of damaged or replacement buildings, reconstruction or repairs made to a building that are valued at less than fifty (50) percent of the market value of the building before it was damaged or replaced, and which do not increase the outside dimensions of the building. 
l.  Additions to existing buildings above the BFE that do not increase the building's foot print and are valued at less than fifty (50) percent of the market value of the building. 
(2)  Within the regulatory floodway as identified on the regulatory floodway maps designate by DWR, the construction of an appropriate use, will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer and provided that nay structure meets the protection requirements of section 1000.0 of this ordinance: 
a.  Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculation effective regulatory floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: 
1.  Regulatory floodway conveyance: 
'K' = 1.486/n AR 2/3 
Where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of the cross-section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York) 
2.  The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative land cover. 
3.  Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless and applicant's engineer an prove to DWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
(i)  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one (1) foot horizontal for every four (4) feet of the flooded stream's length. 
(ii)  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one (1) foot horizontal for every one (1) foot of the flooded stream's length. 
(iii)  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one (1) foot vertical transition for every ten (10) feet of stream length shall be used. 
(iv)  Transition sections shall be provided between cross-sections with rapid expansions and contractions wand when meeting the regulatory floodway delineation on adjacent properties. 
(v)  All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to the flood flows. 
b.  Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase downstream flooding. Compensatory storage shall be provided for any regulatory floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least one and one-half (11/2) times the volume of flood plain storage lost. Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. The compensatory regulatory floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. Al such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to DWR through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. 
c.  Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream erosion of flood heights. For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities. However in the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures. 
d.  Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway approaches. The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth (0.1) of one foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth (0.1) of one foot, the developer must contact DWR, dam safety section for a dam safety permit or waiver. 
1.  The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section 600.0 of this ordinance. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA Hydraulic Chart for the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways calculation procedures. 
2.  Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per section 800.0(c)(2)b. 
3.  Velocity increases must be mitigated per section 800.0(c)(2)c. 
4.  If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, a Department of Transportation permit must be received. 
5.  The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to DWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by section 800.0(c). 
6.  All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designated per section 800.0(c)(2)h. 
e.  Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts, and approach roads. 
1.  The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than a one-tenth (0.1) foot increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage. 
2.  If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream flood plain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects of flood stages on upstream and downstream properties. 
3.  The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with the Department of Transportation Rules 92 Illinois Administrative Code 708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to the division for review and concurrence before a permit is issued. 
f.  On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water. Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than zero (0.0) feet when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the two hundred (200) year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from DWR, dam safety section for a dam safety permit or waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures as defined in section 300.0 shall meet the permitting requirements of 92 Illinois Administrative Code 702 (Construction and maintenance of dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that: 
1.  The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention; 
2.  The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
3.  The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin. 
4.  A non-point source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants. If there is more than one (1) municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control; 
5.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section. 
g.  Flood proofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial structures. If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten (10) feet from the outside of the building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities. 
h.  Excavation in the floodway. When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation . The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant engineer can prove to DWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
1.  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one (1) foot horizontal for every four (4) feet of the flooded stream's length; 
2.  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one (1) foot horizontal for every one (1) foot of the flooded stream's length; and 
3.  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one (1) foot vertical transition for every ten (10) feet of stream length shall be used. 
4.  Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream of the transitions sections. 
i.  [Channel modification.] If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that: 
1.  There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, flood proofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the flood plain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat; 
2.  Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values; 
3.  The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
(i)  The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel modification design, where practical. 
(ii)  Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and down stream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion. 
(iii)  One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one (1) side of the channel, where possible to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation. 
(iv)  Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel. 
(v)  Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than three (3) to one (1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Natural vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
(vi)  All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover. 
(vii)  If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate. 
(viii)  A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality. 
(ix)  New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel. 
(x)  There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project. 
(xi)  Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and 
4.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section. 
j.  Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant. 
k.  Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria: 
1.  The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior to the initiation of improvements. 
2.  Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within fifteen (15) days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within fifteen (15) days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty (60) days. 
3.  Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches, and sediment basins. 
4.  A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty-five (25) feet in width shall be preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing channels (See section 800.0(c)(2)p.). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, wherever necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately. 
5.  Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book" and "Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control" (IEPA, 1987). 
l.  Public flood control projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to DWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to an including the 100-year frequency event. 
m.  General criteria for analysis of flood elevations. 
1.  The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the regulatory floodway study, referenced in section 600.0, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, DWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use. 
2.  If the 100-year regulatory floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet the requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations. 
3.  If the applicant learns from DWR, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five (5) years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built. 
n.  Conditional letter of map revision. If the appropriate use would result in a change in the regulatory floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to DWR and to FEMA all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional regulatory floodway map revision and receive from DWR a conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change before a permit is issued. However, the final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by DWR until as-built plans or record drawings are submitted and accepted by FEMA and DWR. In the case of non-government projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional regulatory floodway map revision before DWR approval can be given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. No further development activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA and DWR. 
o.  Professional engineer's supervision. All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer. 
p.  [Buffer strips.] For all activities in the floodway involving construction within twenty-five (25) feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met: 
1.  A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least twenty-five (25) feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel. 
2.  Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of construction. 
3.  The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer strip. Access through this buffer strip shall be provided, when necessary, for stream maintenance purposes. 
After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as necessary to change the regulatory floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the regulatory floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The regulatory floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by DWR and FEMA of the "as built" plans. 
(3)  State review. For those projects listed below located in a regulatory floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to DWR for their review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit: 
a.  DWR will review an engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge pursuant to section 800.0(c)(2)d. 
b.  DWR will review an engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the proposed flood profile, pursuant to section 800.0(c)(2)e. 
c.  The DWR will review alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to section 800.0(c)(2)a., b. and h. 
d.  The DWR will review and approve prior to the start of construction any department projects, dams (as defined in section 300.0) and all other state, federal or local units of government projects, including projects of the municipality or country. 
(4)  Other permits. In addition to the other requirements of this ordinance, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required from DWR, issued pursuant to 615 ILCS 5/5 et seq. No permit from DWR shall be required if the division has delegated this responsibility to the village administrator. 
(5)  Dam safety permits. Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam as defined in section 300.0 per 92 Illinois Administrative Code 702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall obtain an Illinois Division of Water Resources Dam safety permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the village administrator finds a dam that does not have a DWR permit, the village administrator shall immediately notify the dam safety section of the division of water resources. If the village administrator finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the village administrator shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, DWR, dam safety section in Springfield and the Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster Agency (ESDA).

Should no elevation information exist for the site, the developer's engineer shall calculate the elevation according to section 600.0(4). Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the sites first flood insurance rate map identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this ordinance. The building official shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existing prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. 
(3)  The village administrator shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state, and federal permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The village administrator shall not issue the development permit unless all required local, state and federal permits have been obtained. 
(c)  Preventing increased damages. No development in the SFHA, where a floodway has not been determined shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this ordinance. 
(1)  [Applicable standards.] Within all riverine SFHA's where the floodway has not been determined, the following standards shall apply: 
a.

As an alternative, the developer should have an engineering study performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering study to DWR for acceptance as a regulatory floodway. Upon acceptance of their floodway by the department, the developer shall then demonstrate that the project meets the requirements of section 800.0 for the regulatory floodway. The floodway shall be defined according to the definition in section 300.0 of this ordinance. 
b.  A development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit from DWR or written documentation that a permit is not required from DWR. 
c.  No permit from DWR shall be required if the division has delegated permit responsibility to the village administrator per 92 Illinois Administrative Code, part 708 for regulatory floodways, per DWR statewide permit entitled "Construction in Flood Plains With No Designated Floodways in Northeastern Illinois." 
d.  Dam safety permits. Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam or an on-stream structure to impound water as defined in section 300.0 shall obtain an Illinois Division of Water Resources Dam safety permit or letter indicating a permit is not required prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the village administrator finds a dam that does not have DWR permit, the village administrator shall immediately notify the dam safety section of the division of water resources. If the village administrator finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the village administrator shall immediately notify the owner of the dam and the Illinois Emergency Services, DWR, Dam Safety Section in Springfield and Disaster Agency (ESDA). 
e.  The following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's review or calculation of a base flood elevation and regulatory floodway. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this ordinance: 
1.  Underground and overhead utilities that: 
(i)  Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations, or 
(ii)  Do not require the placement of above ground structures in the floodway, or 
(iii)  In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three (3) feet below the existing streambed, and 
(iv)  In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as not to catch debris. 
2.  Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that: 
(i)  Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent natural bank slope, and 
(ii)  Do not result in an increase in ground elevation, and

(2)  Carrying capacity and notification. For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance (including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be maintained. In addition, the village administrator shall notify adjacent communities in writing thirty (30) days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or relocation of the watercourse. 
(3)  Protecting buildings. 
a.  All buildings located within a 100-year flood plain also know as SFHA, shall be protected from flood damage below the flood protection elevation. However, existing buildings located within a regulatory floodway shall also meet the more restrictive appropriate use standards included in section 800.0. This building protection criteria applies to the following situations: 
1.  Construction or placement of a new building; 
2.  A structural alteration to an existing building that either increases the first floor area by more than twenty (20) percent or the building's market value by more than fifty (50) percent; 
3.  Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured home on an existing site. This building protection requirements does not apply to returning a mobile home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was removed to avoid flood damage; and 
4.  Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days. 
b.  This building protection requirement may be met by one (1) of the following methods: 
1.  A residential or non-residential building, when allowed, may be constructed on permanent land fill in accordance with the following: 
(i)  The lowest floor, (including basement) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation. 
(ii)  The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one (1) foot deep before compaction and should extend at least ten (10) feet beyond the foundation of the building before sloping below the flood protection elevation. The top of the fill shall be above the flood protection elevation. However, the ten (10) foot minimum may be waived if a structural engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures. The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour. The fill shall not adversely effect the flow or surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties. 
2.  A residential or non-residential building may be elevated in accordance with the following: 
(i)  The building or improvements shall be elevated on crawl space, stilts, piles, walls, or other foundation that is permanently open to flood waters and not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The permanent openings shall be no more than one (1) foot above grade, and consists of a minimum of two (2) openings. The openings must have a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every one (1) square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding below the base flood elevation. 
(ii)  The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves, ice and floating debris. 
(iii)  All areas below the flood protection elevation shall be constructed of materials resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor (including basement) and all electrical, heating, ventilating, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and utility meters shall be locate at or above the flood protection elevation. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other waterproofed service facilities may be located below the flood protection elevation. 
(iv)  No area below the flood protection elevation shall be used for storage of items or materials. 
(v)  Manufactured homes and travel trailers to be installed on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days, shall be elevated to or above the flood protection elevation; and, shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement by being tied down in accordance with the Rules and Regulations for the Illinois Mobile Home Tie-Down Act issued pursuant to 77 Illinois Administrative Code 870. 
3.  Only a non-residential building may be structurally floodproofed (in lieu of elevation) provided that a registered professional engineer shall certify that the building has been structurally dry floodproofed below the flood protection elevation, the structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The building design shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy, and impacts from debris or ice. Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention and without an outside source of electricity (levees, berms, floodwalls and similar works are not considered floodproofing for the purpose of this subsection). 
4.  Non-conforming structures located in a regulatory floodway may remain in use, but may not be enlarged, replaced or structurally altered. A non-conforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other natural or man-made disaster may be restored unless the damage exceeds fifty (50) percent of its market value before it was damaged, in which case it shall conform to this ordinance. 
5.  Buildings constructed on property removed from the floodplain by filling shall have their lowest habitable floors (including basements) set at the flood protection elevation. If the builder chooses to accept the higher risk of constructing habitable floors below the flood protection elevation, the lowest floor may be as much as five (5) feet below the base flood elevation, provided the builder demonstrates compliance with the simplified approach identified in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Technical Bulletin 10-01. 
Section 1100.0. Other development requirements. 
    The board of trustees shall take into account flood hazards, to the extent that they are known in all official actions related to land management, use and development. 
(1)  New subdivisions, manufactured home parks, annexation agreements, and planned unit developments (PUDs) within the SFHA shall be reviewed to assure that the proposed developments are consistent with sections 700.0, 800.0, 900.0 and 1000.0 of this ordinance and the need to minimize flood damage. Plats or plans for new subdivisions, mobile home parks and planned unit developments (PUDs) shall include a signed statement by a registered professional engineer that the plat or plans account for changes in the drainage of surface waters in accordance with the Plat Act 765 ILCS 205/2. 
(2)  Proposals for new subdivisions, manufactured home parks, travel trailer parks, planned unit developments (PUDs) and additions to manufactured home parks and additions to subdivisions shall include base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation data and floodway delineations.. Where this information is not available from an existing study filed with the Illinois State Water Survey, the applicant's engineer shall be responsible for calculating the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation per section 600.0(4) and the floodway delineation per the definition in section 300.0 and submitting it to the State Water Survey and DWR for review and approval as best available regulatory data. 
(3)  Streets, blocks, lots, parks and other public grounds shall be located and laid out in such a manner as to preserve and utilize natural streams and channels. Wherever possible, the flood plains shall be included within parks or other public grounds. 
(4)  The board of trustees shall not approve any planned unit development (PUD) or plat of subdivision located outside the corporate limits unless such agreement or plat is in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
(5)  All new plats recorded shall show the location of any SFHA which appears on the platted property and shall be signed, sealed and certified by an Illinois registered land surveyor as per the requirements of Public Act 85-267. 
Section 1200.0. Variances. 
    No variances shall be granted to any development located in a regulatory floodway as defined in section 300.0. However, when a development proposal is located outside of a regulatory floodway, and whenever the standards of this ordinance place undue hardship on a specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the village for a variance. The village administrator shall review the applicant's request for a variance and shall submit his recommendation to the board of trustees. 
(1)  No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that: 
a.  The development activity cannot be located outside the SFHA; 
b.  An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not granted; 
c.  The relief requested is the minimum necessary; 
d.  There will be no additional threat to public health and safety; 
e.  There will be no additional public expense for flood protection, rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to stream beds and banks, roads, utilities, or other public facilities; 
f.  The provisions of sections 700.0(c) and 900.0(c) of this ordinance shall still be met; 
g.  The activity is not in a regulatory floodway; 
h.  The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not represent a general problem; and 
i.  The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character of the area involved including existing stream uses. 
(2)  The village administrator shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements of section 1000.0 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will: 
a.  Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; 
b.  Increase the risks to life and property; and 
c.  Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and that he will acknowledge in writing that he assumes the risk and liability. 
(3)  Variances requested in connection with restoration of a site or building listed on the National Register of Historical Places or documented as worthy of preservation by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of this section. 
Section 1300.0. Disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that development, either inside or outside of the SFHA, will be free from flooding or damage. This ordinance does not create liability on the part of the village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. 
Section 1400.0. Penalty. 
    Failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of a variance resolution shall be deemed to be a violation of this ordinance. Upon due investigation, the village administrator may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this ordinance exist. The village administrator shall notify the owner in writing of such violation. 
(1)  If such owner fails after ten (10) days notice to correct the violation: 
a.  The village administrator may make application to the circuit court for an injunction requiring conformance with this ordinance or make such other order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with the ordinance. 
b.  Any person who violates this ordinance shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each offence. 
c.  A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues. 
d.  The village administrator may record a notice of violation on the title to the property. 
(2)  The village administrator shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and, therefore, may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended. 
(3)  Nothing herein shall prevent the village administrator from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. 
Section 1500.0. Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this ordinance and other ordinance, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. This ordinance is intended to repeal the original ordinance or resolution which was adopted to meet the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, but is not intended to repeal the resolution which the village passed in order to establish initial eligibility for the program. Ordinance No. 1039 is hereby repealed. 
Section 1600.0. Separability. 
    The provisions and sections of this ordinance shall be deemed separable and the invalidity of any portion of this ordinance shall not affect the validity of the remainder. 
Section 1700.0. Effective date. 
    This ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage, approval, and publication, as required by law. 
(Ord. No. 2376, § I, 12-1-03; Ord. No. 2829, § I, 1-12-09; Ord. No. 3138, 1-6-14; Ord. No. 3403, §§ I-V, 1-7-19; Ord. No. 3405, §§ I-V, 2-4-19) 
Sec. 7-182. - Ordinance 1748-Soil erosion and sedimentation control ordinance. 
Section 100.0. Findings and purpose. 
(a)  Findings. The board of trustees of the village hereby finds that: 
(1)  Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain non-agricultural uses including but not limited to the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and industrial plants, the building of roads and highways, the modification of stream channels and drainageways, and the creation of recreational facilities; 
(2)  The washing, blowing, and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof, by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles; 
(3)  Soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies, washed-out fills, and embankments; 
(4)  Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and reservoirs; 
(5)  Sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes, promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds, destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life, and is costly and difficult to remove; and 
(6)  Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage capacity of floodplains and natural depressions, resulting in increased chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety. 
(b)  [Purpose.] The board of trustees therefore declares that the purpose of this ordinance is to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment, and promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land situated in the village. It is the intention of this ordinance that the delivery of sediment from sites affected by land disturbing activities be limited, as closely as practicable, to that which would have occurred if the land had been left in its natural undisturbed state. The ordinance is applied to all development, as defined in section 7-181, in the village.

Section 300.0. General principles. 
    It is the objective of this ordinance to control soil erosion and sedimentation caused by development activities, including clearing, grading, stripping, excavating, and filling of land, in the village. Measures taken to control soil erosion and offsite sediment runoff should be adequate to assure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of 10-year frequency of less. The erosion and sedimentation control practices discussed in the Illinois Urban Manual and the following principles shall apply to all development activities within the village and to the preparation of the submissions required under section 400.0 of this ordinance: 
(1)  Development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible. 
(2)  Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses, lakes, ponds, and wetlands should be left undisturbed wherever possible. Temporary crossings of watercourses, when permitted, must include appropriate stabilization measures. 
(3)  Special precautions should be taken to prevent damages resultant from any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake, pond, or wetland. Preventative measures should reflect the sensitivity of these areas to erosion and sedimentation. 
(4)  The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development. 
(5)  Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions, and any other appropriate sediment or runoff control measures should be installed prior to site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters from land undergoing development. 
(6)  The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs, and benefits involved. 
(7)  In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered. 
(8)  Provision should be made to accommodate the increased run-off caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities and rates of discharge will no create additional erosion onsite or downstream. 
(9)  Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and functional as soon as practical during development. 
(10)  Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land uses should be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to development. 
(11)  All waste generated as a result of site development activity should be property disposed of and should be prevented from being carried off the site by either wind or water. 
(12)  All construction sites should provide measures to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. 
Section 400.0. Site development permit. 
(a)  Permit required. Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, no persons shall commence or perform any clearing, grading, stripping, excavating, or filling of land which meets the following provisions without having first obtained a site development permit from the building department of the village.

b.  such permit is accompanied by or combined with a valid building permit issued by the village, or 
c.  the proposed earth moving is coordinated with any overall development program previously approved by the village for the area in which the site is situated; and 
d.  all relevant federal and state permits (i.e., for floodplains and wetlands) have been received for the portion of the site subject to soil disturbance. 
(3)  Failure of the village to act on an original or revised application within thirty (30) days of receipt shall authorize the applicant to proceed in accordance with the plans as filed unless such time is extended by agreement between the village and the applicant. Pending preparation and approval of a revised plan, development activities shall be allowed to proceed in accordance with conditions established by the village. 
(g)  Expiration of permit. Every site development permit shall expire and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days, or is not completed by a date which shall be specified in the permit; except that the planning department may, if the permittee presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work being commenced or completed within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time if written application is made before the expiration date of the permit. The planning department may require modification of the erosion control plan to prevent any increase in erosion control plan to prevent any increase in erosion or offsite sediment runoff resulting from any extension. 
(h)  Appeals. The applicant, or any person or agency which received notice of the filing of the application may appeal the decision of the planning department as provided in section 400.0(f), to the board of appeals. Upon receipt of an appeal, the board of appeals shall schedule and hold a public hearing, after giving fifteen (15) days notice thereof. The board shall render a decision within thirty (30) days after the hearing. Factors to be considered on review shall include, but need not be limited to, the effects of the proposed development activities on the surface water flow to tributary and downstream lands, any comprehensive watershed management plans, or the use of any retention facilities; possible saturation of fill and unsupported cuts by water, both natural and domestic; runoff surface waters that produce erosion and silting of drainageways; nature and type of soil or rock which when disturbed by the proposed development activities may create earth movement and produce slopes that cannot be landscaped and excessive and unnecessary scarring of the natural landscape through grading or removal of vegetation. 
(i)  Retention of plans. Plans, specifications, and reports for all site developments shall be retained in original form or on microfilm by the village. 
Section 500.0. Design and operation standards and requirements. 
(a)  Applicability. All clearing, grading, stripping, excavating, and filling which is subject to the permit requirements of this ordinance shall be subject to the applicable standards and requirements set forth in this section. 
(b)  Responsibility. The permittee shall not be relieved of responsibility for damage to persons or property otherwise imposed by law, and the village or its officers or agents will not be made liable for such damage, by: 
(1)  The issuance of a permit under this ordinance, 
(2)  Compliance with the provisions of that permit or with conditions attached to it by the planning department, 
(3)  Failure of village officials to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly conditions, 
(4)  Failure of village officials to recommend denial of or to deny a permit, or 
(5)  Exemptions from the permit requirements of this ordinance. 
(c)  Site design requirements. 
(1)  On-site sediment control measures, as specified by the following criteria, shall be constructed and functional prior to initiating clearing, grading, stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site. 
a.  For disturbed areas draining less than one (1) acre, filter barriers (including filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measures) shall be constructed to control all offsite runoff as specified in reference handbooks. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of twenty-five (25) feet, may be used as an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is expected. 
b.  For disturbed areas draining more than one (1) but less than five (5) acres, a sediment trap or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point of the disturbed area. 
c.  For disturbed areas draining more than five (5) acres, a sediment basin or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point of the disturbed area. 
d.  Sediment basins and sediment traps designs shall provide for both detention storage and sediment storage. The detention storage shall be composed of equal volumes of "wet" detention storage and "dry" detention storage and each shall be sized for the 2-year, 24-hour runoff from the site under maximum runoff conditions during construction. The release rate of the basin shall be that rate required to achieve minimum detention times of at least ten (10) hours. The elevation of the outlet structure shall be placed such that it only drains the dry detention storage. 
e.  The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated sediment load generated from the site over the duration of the construction period with a minimum storage equivalent to the volume of sediment generated in one (1) year. For construction periods exceeding one (1) year, the one (1) year sediment load and a sediment removal schedule may be substituted. 
(2)  Stormwater conveyance channels, including ditches, swales, and diversions, and the outlets of all channels and pipes shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected flow velocity from the 10-year frequency storm without erosion. All constructed or modified channels shall be stabilized within forty-eight (48) hours, consistent with the following standards: 
a.  For grades up to four (4) percent, seeding in combination with mulch, erosion blanket, or an equivalent control measure shall be applied. Sod or erosion blanket or mat shall be applied to the bottom of the channel. 
b.  For grades of four (4) to eight (8) percent, sod or an equivalent control measure shall be applied in the channel. 
c.  For grades greater than eight (8) percent, rock, riprap, or an equivalent control measure shall be applied, or the grade shall be effectively reduced using drop structures. 
(3)  Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent measures within three (3) calendar days following the end of active disturbance, or re-disturbance, consistent with the following criteria: 
a.  Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall include seeding, mulching, sodding, and/or non-vegetative measures. 
b.  Areas having slopes greater than twelve (12) percent shall be stabilized with sod, mat or blanket in combination with seeding, or equivalent. 
(4)  Land disturbance activities in stream channels shall be avoided, where possible. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following requirements shall be met: 
a.  Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel to the maximum extent practicable. Where construction crossings are necessary, temporary crossings shall be constructed on non-erosive material, such as riprap or gravel. 
b.  The time and area of disturbance of stream channels shall be kept to a minimum. The stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be restabilized within forty-eight (48) hours after channel disturbance is completed, interrupted, or stopped. 
c.  Whenever channel relocation is necessary, the new channel shall be constructed in the dry and fully stabilized before flow is diverted. 
(5)  Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment traps or filter barriers meeting accepted design standards and specifications. 
(6)  Soil storage piles containing more than ten (10) cubic yards of material shall not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than twenty-five (25) feet to a roadway or drainage channel. Filter barriers, including straw bales, filter fence, or equivalent, shall be installed immediately on the downslope side of the piles. 
(7)  If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be protected from erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through appropriately designed sediment traps or basins or equivalent. 
(8)  Each site shall have graveled (or equivalent) entrance roads, access drives, and parking areas of sufficient length and width to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed by shoveling or street cleaning (not flushing) before the end of each workday and transported to a controlled sediment disposal area. 
(9)  All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices must be maintained and repaired as needed to assure effective performance of their intended function. 
(10)  All temporary erosion and sediment control measurers shall be disposed of within thirty (30) days after final site stabilization is achieved with permanent soil stabilization measures. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures should be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation. 
(11)  The condition of the construction site for the winter shut down period shall address proper sediment and erosion control early in the fall growing season so that slopes and other bare earth areas may be stabilized with temporary and/or permanent vegetative cover. All open areas that are to remain idle throughout the winter shall receive temporary erosion control measure including temporary seeding, mulching and/or erosion control blanketing prior to the end of the fall growing season. The areas to be worked beyond the end of the growing season must incorporate soil stabilization measures that do not rely on vegetative cover such as erosion control blankets and heavy mulching. 
(d)  Handbooks adopted by reference. The standards and specifications contained in the "Illinois Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control" cited in section 400.0 are hereby incorporated into this section and made a part hereof by reference for the purpose of delineating procedures and methods of operation under site development and erosion and sedimentation control plans approved under section 400.0. In the event of conflict between provisions of said manuals and of this ordinance, the ordinance shall govern. 
(e)  Maintenance and control measures. All soil erosion and sediment control measures necessary to meet the requirements of this ordinance shall be maintained periodically by the applicant or subsequent land owner during the period of land disturbance and development of the site in a satisfactory manner to ensure adequate performance. 
(f)  Inspection. The building official or his representative shall make inspections as hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee wherein the work fails to comply with the site development or erosion and sedimentation control plan as approved. Plans for grading, stripping, excavating, and filling work bearing the stamp of approval of the (permitting authority) shall be maintained at the site during progress of the work. In order to obtain inspections and to ensure compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan, the grading or building permit, and this ordinance, the permittee shall notify the building official within two (2) working days of the completion of the construction stages specified below: 
(1)  Upon completion of installation of sediment and runoff control measures (including perimeter controls and diversions), prior to proceeding with any other earth disturbance or grading; 
(2)  After stripping and clearing; 
(3)  After rough grading; 
(4)  After final grading; 
(5)  After seeding and landscaping deadlines; and 
(6)  After final stabilization and landscaping, prior to removal of sediment controls. 
If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are to be done in phases or areas, the permittee shall give notice and request inspection at the completion of each of the above work stages in each phase or area. If an inspection is not made and notification of the results given within five (5) working days after notice is received by the village from the permittee, the permittee may continue work at his/her own risk, without presuming acceptance by the village. Notification of the results of the inspection shall be given in writing at the site. 
(g)  Special precautions. 
(1)  If at any stage of the grading of any development site, the village engineer or his designee determines by inspection that the nature of the site is such that further work authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any property, public way, stream, lake, wetland, or drainage structure, the village engineer or his designee may require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable special precautions to be taken as considered advisable to avoid the likelihood of such peril. "Special precautions" may include, but shall not be limited to, a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berm, more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berm, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, and recommendations of a registered soils engineer and/or engineering geologist which may be made requirements for further work. 
(2)  Where is appears that storm damage may result because the grading on any development site is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the village may specify the time of starting grading and time of completion or may require that the operations be conducted in specific stages so as to insure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains. 
(h)  Amendment of plans. Major amendments of the site development or erosion and sedimentation control plans shall be submitted to the planning department and shall be processed and approved or disapproved in the same manner as the original plans. Field modifications of a minor nature may be authorized by the building official by written authorization to the permittee. 
Section 600.0. Enforcement. 
(a)  Exceptions. The board of appeals may, in accordance with the following procedures, authorize exceptions to any of the requirements and regulations set forth in this ordinance. 
(1)  Application for any exception shall be made by a verified petition of the applicant for a site development permit, stating fully the grounds of the petition and the facts relied upon by the applicant. Such petition shall be filed with the site development application. In order for the petition to be granted, it shall be necessary that the board of appeals find all of the following facts with respect to the land referred to in the petition:

(Ord. No. 2376, § I, 12-1-03) 
Sec. 7-183. - Ordinance 1749-Stream and wetland protection ordinance. 
Section 4-10-1. Authority. 
    The Lowland Conservancy Overlay District is adopted by the board of trustees, pursuant to 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-13-1. 
Section 4-10-2. Short title. 
    This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the Plainfield Lowland Conservancy Overlay District Ordinance. 
Section 4-10-3. Purpose and intent. 
    It is the purpose and intent of this ordinance to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the present and future residents of Plainfield and downstream drainage areas by providing for the protection, preservation, proper maintenance, and use of Plainfield watercourses, lakes, ponds, floodplain and wetland areas. This ordinance applies to all development within the village. This ordinance is more specifically adopted: 
(1)  To prevent flood damage by preserving storm and flood water storage capacity; 
(2)  To maintain the normal hydrologic balance of streams, floodplains, ponds, lakes, wetlands, and groundwater by storing and providing for infiltration of wet-period runoff in floodplains and wetlands, and releasing it slowly to the stream to maintain in-stream flow; 
(3)  To manage stormwater runoff and maintain natural runoff conveyance systems, and minimize the need for major storm sewer construction and drainageway modification; 
(4)  To improve water quality, both by filtering and storing sediments and attached pollutants, nutrients, and organic compounds before they drain into streams or wetlands, and by maintaining the natural pollutant-assimilating capabilities of streams, floodplains and wetlands; 
(5)  To protect shorelines and stream banks from soil erosion, using natural means and materials wherever possible; 
(6)  To protect fish spawning, breeding, nursery and feeding grounds; 
(7)  To protect wildlife habitat; 
(8)  To preserve areas of special recreational, scenic, or scientific interest, including natural areas and habitats of endangered species; 
(9)  To maintain and enhance the aesthetic qualities of developing areas; and 
(10)  To encourage the continued economic growth and high quality of life of the village which depends in part on an adequate quality of water, a pleasing natural environment, and recreational opportunities in proximity to the village. 
    In order to achieve the purpose and intent of this ordinance, the village hereby designates the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District which shall be considered as an overlay to the zoning districts created by the village zoning ordinances as amended. Any proposed development activity with the district must obtain a special use permit as approved by the governing body of the village. 
Section 4-10-4. Definitions. 
    Armoring. A form of channel modification which involves the placement of materials (concrete, riprap, bulkheads, etc.) within a stream channel or along a shoreline to protect property above streams, lakes, and ponds from erosion and wave damage caused by wave action and stream flow. 
    Bulkhead. A retaining wall that protects property along water. 
    Channel. A natural or artificial watercourse of perceptible extent that periodically or continuously contains moving water, or which forms a connecting link between two (2) bodies of water. It has a definite bed and banks that serve to contain the water. 
    Channel modification or channelization. To alter a watercourse by changing the physical dimension or materials of the channel. Channel modification includes damming, riprapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening, straightening, relocating, lining and significant removal of bottom or woody vegetation. Channel modification does not include the clearing of debris or trash from the watercourse. Channelization is a severe form of channel modification involving a significant change in the channel cross-section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g., straightening). 
    Control structures. A structure designed to control the rate of stormwater runoff that passes through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water surface elevation. 
    Culvert. A structure designed to carry drainage water or small streams below barriers such as roads, driveways, or railway embankments. 
    Depression 1 area. Any area which is lower in elevation on all sides than surrounding properties (i.e., does not drain freely), or whose drainage is severely limited such as by a restrictive culvert. A depressional area will fill with water on occasion when run off into it exceeds rate of infiltration into underlying soil or exceeds the discharge through its controlled outlet. Large depressional areas may provide significant stormwater or floodplain storage. 
    Development. The carrying out of any building, agricultural, or mining operation, or the making of any change in the use or appearance of land, and the dividing of land into two (2) or more parcels.

Section 4-10-6. General provisions; area affected. 
    This ordinance applies to development in or near streams, lakes, ponds and wetlands within the village. Streams, lakes, and ponds (including intermittent streams) are those which are shown on the United States Department of the Interior Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle maps and those additional streams, lakes, and ponds delineated on maps adopted as part of this ordinance. Those maps are hereby made a part of this ordinance, and two (2) copies thereof shall remain on file in the office of the village clerk for public inspection. Within the jurisdiction of the village, those waterbodies and watercourses that are named and are subject to the provisions of this ordinance are: (list of waterbodies and watercourses). Wetlands are those designated in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Illinois Department of Conservation wetland inventory and those additional wetlands delineated on maps adopted as part of this ordinance. If new drainage courses, lakes, ponds or wetlands are created as part of a development, the requirements for setbacks and uses within setbacks, and the criteria for watercourse relocation and minor modification shall apply. The district shall be amended as appropriate to include these areas. 
Section 4-10-6-1. Lowland Conservancy Overlay District. 
    The Lowland Conservancy Overlay District shall be considered as an overlay to the zoning districts created by the village zoning ordinance as amended. In addition to the requirements of this ordinance, applicants for a special use permit within the district shall meet all requirements of the underlying zoning districts. In the event of a conflict between the overlay district requirements and the underlying zoning district requirements, the most restrictive requirements prevail. 
Section 4-10-6-2. District boundary. 
    The procedures, standards and requirements contained in this ordinance shall apply to all lots within wetlands and streams, and all lots lying wholly or in part: 
(1)  Within the special flood hazard area (SFHA) designated by the federal emergency management agency (FEMA); or 
(2)  Within one hundred (100) feet of the ordinary high water mark (OHWM) of a perennial stream or intermittent stream, the ordinary high watermark of a lake or pond, or the edge of a wetland; or 
(3)  Within depressional areas serving as floodplain or stormwater storage areas, as designated on the lowland conservancy district map. 
    The district is designated on a map labeled "Lowland Conservancy Overlay District Map", which is made to be part of this ordinance and which has the same force and effect as if all the notations, references, and descriptions shown thereon were set forth or described herein. Designated areas are shown on said map which shall be and remain on file in the office of the village clerk, and additional areas may be approved from time to time and be made exhibits hereto. 
Section 4-10-6-3. Minimum setback of development activity from streams. 
(a)  Minimum setback. Absolutely no development activity (except as provided below) may occur within the minimum setback which is defined as seventy-five (75) feet from the ordinary high water mark of streams, lakes and ponds, or the edge of wetlands, or within a designated depressional area. In no case shall the setback be less than the boundary of the 100-year floodway as defined by FEMA. These setback requirements do not apply to a stream in a culvert unless the stream is taken out of the culvert as part of development activity. If a culvert functions as a low-flow culvert, where water is intended to periodically flow over it, the setback requirements apply. 
(b)  Development activities. The following development activities may be permitted, subject to issuance of a special use permit, within the minimum setback areas only if, as a practical matter, they cannot be located outside the setback area. Such development activities will only be approved based upon a report, prepared by a qualified professional, which demonstrates that they will not adversely affect water quality; destroy, damage or disrupt significant habitat area, adversely affect drainage and/or stormwater retention capabilities; adversely affect flood conveyance and storage; lead to unstable earth conditions, create erosion hazards, or be materially detrimental to any other property in the area of the subject property or to the village as a whole, including the loss of open space or scenic vistas: 
(1)  Minor improvements such as walkways, benches, comfort stations, informational displays, directional signs, foot bridges, observation decks, and docks; 
(2)  The maintenance, repair, replacement, and reconstruction of existing highways and bridges, electrical transmission and telecommunication lines, poles, and towers; and 
(3)  The establishment and development of public and private parks and recreation areas, outdoor education areas, historic natural and scientific areas, game refuges, fish and wildlife improvement projects, game bird and animal farms, wildlife preserves and public boat launching ramps. 
(c)  Considerations. Review of the proposed development activity within the minimum setback area will consider the following: 
(1)  Only limited filling and excavating necessary for the development of public boat launching ramps, swimming beaches, or the development of park shelters or similar structures is allowed. The development and maintenance of roads, parking lots and other impervious surfaces necessary for permitted uses are allowed only on a very limited basis, and where no alternate location outside of the setback area is available. 
(2)  Land surface modification within the minimum setback shall be permitted for the development of stormwater drainage swales between the developed area of the site (including a stormwater detention facility on the site) and a stream, lake or pond, or wetlands detention basins within the setback are generally discouraged, unless it can be shown that resultant modification will not impair water quality, habitat, or flood storage functions. 
(3)  No filling or excavating within wetlands is permitted except to install piers for the limited development of walkways and observation decks. Walkways and observation decks should avoid high quality wetland areas, and should not adversely affect natural areas designated in the Illinois Natural Areas Inventory or the habitat of rare or endangered species. 
(4)  Wetland area occupied by the development of decks and walkways must be mitigated by an equal area of wetland habitat improvement. 
(5)  Modification of degraded wetlands for purposes of stormwater management is permitted where the quality of the wetland is improved and total wetland acreage is preserved. Where such modification is permitted, wetlands shall be protected from the effects of increased stormwater runoff by measures such as detention or sedimentation basins, vegetated swales and buffer strips, and sediment and erosion control measures on adjacent developments. the direct entry of storm sewers into wetlands shall be avoided. Environmental impact analysis of wetland modification may be required in accordance with section 4-10-8 of this ordinance. 
(d)  Applicants for special use permit. 
(1)  An applicant for a special use permit must stabilize areas left exposed after land surface modification with vegetation normally associated with that stream or wetland. The planting of native riparian vegetation is recommended as the preferred stabilization measure. Other techniques should be used only when and where vegetation fails to control erosion. The preferred alternative is riprap, using natural rock materials where practicable, installed on eroding bank areas in a manner that provides interstitial space for vegetative growth and habitat for macroinvertebrates and other stream organisms. Lining of the stream channel bottom is not permitted. 
(2)  The applicant shall minimize access to the applicant's proposed development activity within all or part of the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District where such access could adversely affect the stream, lake, pond, wetland, or related environmentally sensitive areas. 
Section 4-10-6-4. Site development plan. 
    A site development plan must be prepared for any proposed development within, or partly within, the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District and must indicate: 
(1)  Dimension and area of parcel, showing also the vicinity of the site in sufficient detail to enable easy location, in the field, of the site for which the special use permit is sought, and including the boundary line, underlying zoning, a legend, a scale, and a north arrow (this requirement may be satisfied by the submission of a separate vicinity map); 
(2)  Location of any existing and proposed structures; 
(3)  Location of existing or proposed on-site sewage systems or private water supply systems; 
(4)  Location of any perennial or intermittent stream, lake or pond, and its ordinary high water mark; 
(5)  Location and landward limit of all wetlands; 
(6)  Location of setback lines as defined in this ordinance; 
(7)  Location of the 100-year floodway; 
(8)  Location of existing or future access roads; 
(9)  Specifications and dimensions of stream, wetland or other water areas proposed for alterations; 
(10)  Cross-sections and calculations indicating any changes in flood storage volumes; and 
(11)  Such other information as reasonably requested by village. 
    The applicant shall present evidence, prepared by a qualified professional, that demonstrates that the proposed development activity will not endanger health and safety, including danger from the obstruction or diversion of flood flow. The developer shall also show, by submitting appropriate calculations and resource inventories, that the proposed development activity will not substantially reduce natural floodwater storage capacity, destroy valuable habitat for aquatic or other flora and fauna, adversely affect water quality or ground water resources, increase stormwater runoff velocity so that water levels on other lands are substantially raised or the danger from flooding increased, or adversely impact any other natural stream, floodplain, or wetland functions, and is otherwise consistent with the intent of this ordinance. 
Section 4-10-6-5. Geologic and soil characteristics; report. 
    The site proposed for development shall be investigated to determine the soil and geologic characteristics, including soil erosion potential. A report, prepared by a licensed professional engineer, geoscientist, or soil scientist experienced in the practice of geologic and soil mechanics, shall be submitted with every application for land development within the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District. This report shall include a description of soil type and stability of surface and subsurface conditions. Any area which the investigation indicates as being subject to geologic or soil hazards shall not be subjected to development, unless the engineer or soil scientist can demonstrate conclusively that these hazards can be overcome. 
Section 4-10-6-6. Hydrologic controls/drainage control plan. 
    A drainage control plan that describes the hydraulic characteristics of on-site and nearby watercourses as well as the proposed drainage plan, prepared by a registered professional engineer experienced in hydrology and hydraulics, shall be submitted with each application for land development within the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District. Unless otherwise noted, the following restrictions, requirements and standards shall apply to all development within the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District: 
(1)  Natural open-channel drainageways shall be preserved; and 
(2)  Runoff from areas of concentrated impervious cover (e.g., roofs, driveways, streets, patios, etc.) shall be collected and transported to a drainageway (preferably a natural drainageway) with sufficient capacity to accept the discharge without undue erosion or detrimental impact. Vegetated drainage swales are preferred over conveyances constructed of concrete or other manufactured materials. 
    The drainage control plan shall identify appropriate measures, such as recharge basins and detention/retention basins, which will limit the quantitative and qualitative effects of stormwater runoff to pre-development conditions. 
Section 4-10-6-7. Site grading and excavation plan. 
    This section applies to the extent that grading and excavation and erosion control plans, which satisfy the following requirements, are not already required by a jurisdiction. 
(1)  Application; contents of plan. A site grading and excavation plan, prepared by a registered professional engineer, trained and experienced in civil engineering, shall be submitted with each application for a special use permit and shall include the following:

b.  Proposed site contours at one (1) foot intervals; 
c.  Dimensions, elevation and contours of grading, excavation and fill; 
d.  A description of methods to be employed in disposing of soil and other materials that is removed from allowable grading and excavation sites, including location of the disposal site if on the property; 
e.  A schedule showing when each stage of the project will be completed, including the total area of soil surface to be disturbed during each stage, and estimated starting and completion dates. The schedule shall be prepared so as to limit, to the shortest possible period, the time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior to initiation of the improvements; and 
f.  A detailed description of the re-vegetation and stabilization methods to be employed, to be prepared in conjunction with the landscape plan per section 4-10-6-8. This description should include locations of erosion control measures such as sedimentation basins, straw bales, diversion swales, etc. 
(2)  Compliance with ordinance. The grading and excavation plan must be consistent with all the provisions of this ordinance. 
(3)  Restrictions and requirements. Unless otherwise provided in this ordinance, the following restrictions, requirements and standards shall apply to all development within the district:

b.  No grading, filling, cleaning, clearing, terracing or excavation of any kind shall be initiated until final engineering plans are approved and the special use permit is granted by the village; and 
c.  The depositing of any excavation, grading or clearing material within a stream, lake, pond or wetland area (i.e., within the district) shall be prohibited. 
(4)  Installation of physical barrier. In addition to locating all site improvements on the subject property to minimize adverse impacts on the stream, lake, pond, or wetland, the applicant shall install a berm, curb, or other physical barrier during construction, and following completion of the project, where necessary, to prevent direct runoff and erosion from any modified land surface into a stream, lake, pond, or wetland. All parking and vehicle circulation areas should be located as far as possible from a stream, lake, pond or wetland. 
(5)  Limit activity. The village may limit development activity in or near a stream, lake, pond, or wetland to specific months, and to a maximum number of continuous days or hours, in order to minimize adverse impacts. Also, the village may require that equipment be operated from only one (1) side of a stream, lake, or pond in order to minimize bank disruption. Other development techniques, donations, and restrictions may be required in order to minimize adverse impacts on streams, lakes, ponds or wetlands, and on any related areas not subject to development activity. 
Section 4-10-6-8. Natural vegetation buffer strip required. 
    To minimize erosion, stabilize the streambank, protect water quality, maintain water temperature at natural levels, preserve fish and wildlife habitat, to screen man-made structures, and also to preserve aesthetic values of the natural watercourse and wetland areas, a natural vegetation strip shall be maintained along the edge of the stream, lake, pond or wetland. The natural vegetation strip shall extend landward a minimum of twenty five (25) feet from the ordinary high water mark of a perennial or intermittent stream, lake or pond and the edge of a wetland. Within the natural vegetation strip, tress and shrubs may be selectively pruned or removed for harvest of merchantable timber, to achieve a filtered view of the waterbody from the principal structure and for reasonable private access to the stream, lake, pond or wetland. Said pruning and removal activities shall ensure that a live root system stays intact to provide for streambank stabilization and erosion control. A landscape plan, prepared by a professional landscape architect, shall be submitted with each special use permit application for development activity within the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District and contain the following: 
(1)  A plan describing the existing vegetative cover of the property and showing those areas where the vegetation will be removed as part of the proposed construction; and 
(2)  A plan describing the proposed re-vegetation of disturbed areas specifying the materials to be used. The vegetation must be planned in such a way that access for stream maintenance purposes shall not be prevented. 
Section 4-10-7. Watercourse relocation and minor modifications. 
    Watercourse relocation or modification is generally not permitted because these activities are not usually consistent with the purposes of this ordinance. Under certain circumstances, relocation and minor modification may be permitted through a special use permit where certain problems can be mitigated by relocation and/or minor modification, specifically when: 
(1)  Off-site hydrologic conditions are causing erosion, flooding and related problems; or 
(2)  On-site soil and geologic conditions are resulting in unstable conditions that pose hazards to life, health, and existing structures or property; or 
(3)  The quality of previously modified or relocated streams can be improved through restoration; or 
(4)  Officially adopted stormwater management plans call for placement of detention or retention facilities in a stream; or 
(5)  Public utilities, including sanitary sewers, pipelines, and roadways require stream crossing or relocation where there are not practical alternatives. 
    Modifications of watercourses as a convenience for site design purposes is not permitted.

    Stream modification, when permitted, is subject to the following conditions and restrictions: 
(1)  Water quality, habitat and other natural functions must be significantly improved by the modification; no significant habitat area may be destroyed; 
(2)  The amount of flow and velocity of a stream is not to be increased or decreased as the stream enters or leaves a subject property, unless this reflects an improvement over previous conditions in terms of reduced flooding, reduced erosion, or enhanced low-flow conditions; 
(3)  Prior to diverting water into a new channel, a qualified professional approved by the village shall inspect the stream modification, and issue a written report to the village that the modified stream complies with the requirements of section 4-10-7-2; and 
(4)  Stream channel enlargement, or other modifications that would increase conveyance, shall not be permitted if the intended purpose is to accommodate development activities in the floodplain. 
Section 4-10-7-2. Content of stream modification/relocation plan. 
    Stream relocation may be permitted in accordance with a stream relocation plan which provides for: 
(1)  The creation of a natural meander pattern, pools, riffles, substrate; 
(2)  The formation of gentle side slopes (at least three (3) feet horizontally per one (1) foot vertically), including installation of erosion control features;

    Armoring in the form of bulkheads, riprap or other materials or devices is not permitted except in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Significant erosion cannot be prevented in any other way and the use of vegetation and gradual bank slopes has not sufficiently stabilized the shoreline or bank; 
(2)  The bulkhead or other device is not placed within a wetland, or between a wetland and a lake or pond; 
(3)  The bulkhead, riprap or other device will minimize the transmittal of wave energy or currents to other properties; and 
(4)  The exchange in the horizontal or vertical configuration of the land must be kept to a minimum. 
    Where permission to install bulkheads or other armoring devices is requested as part of the special use permit application, documentation and certification pertaining to the items above must be submitted. 
Section 4-10-7-4. Use of culverts.

This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to Will County, Village of Plainfield, by the Illinois Compiled Statutes (chapter 65, sections 5/11-12-5, 6 and 12; 5/11-13-1; 11-14-1; 5/11-30-2 and 8; 5/11-105-1; 5/11-109-1; 5/11-110-1; and chapter 50, section 815/1). 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance is to diminish threats to public health, safety and welfare caused by runoff of excessive stormwater from new development and redevelopment in the village. This excessive stormwater could result in the inundation of damageable properties, the erosion and destabilization of downstream channels, and the pollution of valuable stream and lake resources. The cause of increases in stormwater runoff quantity and rate and impairment of quality is the development and improvement of land and as such this ordinance regulates these activities to prevent adverse impacts. 
(c)  Objectives. This ordinance is adopted to accomplish the following objectives: 
(1)  To insure that new development does not increase the drainage or flood hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion; 
(2)  To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage due to increased stormwater runoff; 
(3)  To protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding on a watershed basis; 
(4)  To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood damaged public facilities and utilities, correction of channel erosion problems, and flood rescue and relief operations caused by increased stormwater runoff quantities from new development; 
(5)  To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources; 
(6)  To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of watercourses and flood-plains and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats; 
(7)  To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat; 
(8)  To enhance community aesthetics by promoting establishment of nontidal wetlands for recreational, environmental and ecological benefits.

    For properties which are not required to have stormwater release and storage structures per this section, best management practices for pollutant removal and runoff minimization shall be applied. 
Section 400.0. Drainage plan submittal requirements. 
    Each applicant shall submit the following information, depending on development size, to ensure that the provisions of this ordinance are met. The submittal shall include sufficient information to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the property, the potential adverse impacts of the development on water resources both on-site and downstream, and the effectiveness of the proposed drainage plan in managing stormwater runoff. The applicant shall certify on the drawings that all clearing, grading, drainage, and construction shall be accomplished in strict conformance with the drainage plan. The following information shall be submitted for both existing and proposed property conditions. All information and data required and submitted shall be prepared by and bear the seal of registered Illinois Professional Engineer. 
    Properties smaller than ten (10) acres shall submit only the basic drainage plan called for in section 400.0(1). Properties larger than ten (10) acres shall comply with the submittal requirements of both the basic drainage plan and the advanced drainage plan of section 400.0(2). 
(1)  Basic drainage plan. 
a.  Topographic map: A topographic survey of the property at one (1) foot contours under existing and proposed conditions, and areas upstream and downstream, necessary to determine off-site impacts of the proposed drainage plan. The map shall be keyed to a consistent datum specified by the village. 
b.  Drainage system: Mapping and descriptions, where relevant, of existing and proposed drainage system features of the property and immediate vicinity including: 
1.  The banks and centerline of streams and channels; 
2.  Shoreline of lakes, ponds, and detention basins; 
3.  Farm drains and tiles; 
4.  Sub-watershed boundaries within the property; 
5.  Watershed soils classifications; 
6.  The property's location within the larger watershed; 
7.  Location, size and slope of stormwater conduits and drainage swales; 
8.  Sanitary sewers; 
9.  Depressional storage areas; 
10.  Delineation of upstream and downstream drainage features and watersheds which might be affected by the development; 
11.  Detention facilities; 
12.  Roads and streets and associated stormwater inlets;

(2)  Advanced drainage plan. The same information as required in subsection (1) above is required for properties larger than ten (10) acres along with the following additional information for the minor drainage system's design runoff event and the 100-year event of critical duration: 
a.  Elevations and maps of 100-year flooding; 
b.  Cross-section data for open channel flow paths and designated overland flow paths; 
c.  Direction of stormflows; 
d.  Flow rates and velocities at representative points in the drainage system; and 
e.  A statement by the design engineer of the drainage system's provisions for handling events greater than that 100-year's runoff. 
Section 500.0. Minimization of increases in runoff volumes and rates. 
    It is the policy of the plan commission to encourage design of storm water runoff systems that help retain and maximize the ground water recharge capacity of the area being developed. Wherever possible the subdivider shall give consideration to providing compensatory recharge for the reduction in percolation which occurs when ground surface is paved or roofed over. The use of natural gravel deposits for the lower portions of storm runoff storage areas, the flattening of drainage slopes and the retention of natural topography are examples of possible recharge methods. 
    In the selection of a drainage plan for a development, the applicant shall evaluate and implement, where practicable, site design features which minimize the increase in runoff volumes and rates from the site. The applicant's drainage plan submittal shall include evaluations of site design features which are consistent with the following hierarchy: 
(1)  Minimize impervious surfaces on the property, consistent with the needs of the project; 
(2)  Attenuate flows by use of open vegetated swales and natural depressions so as to reduce runoff rates and volumes, protect aquatic habitats and remove pollutants, and preserve existing natural stream channels; 
(3)  Infiltrate runoff on-site; 
(4)  Provide stormwater retention structures; 
(5)  Utilize wetland detention basins; 
(6)  Provide stormwater detention structures; and 
(7)  Construct storm sewers. 
Section 600.0. Water quality and multiple uses. 
    The drainage system should be designed to minimize adverse water quality impacts downstream and on the property itself. Detention basins shall incorporate design features to capture stormwater runoff pollutants and preference shall be given to wetland systems and wet basins over dry basin designs. Retention and infiltration of stormwater shall be promoted throughout the property's drainage system to reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and to reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants. Best management practices (BMP) including structural devices (e.g., swales, filter strips, infiltration trenches, and detention basins) designed to remove pollutants, reduce runoff rates and volumes, and protect aquatic habitats shall be used. All flows from the site shall be routed through the basin(s). 
    The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where practicable. Uses considered compatible with stormwater management include open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation (boating, trails, playing fields), wetlands and water quality mitigation. The applicant should avoid using portions of the property exclusively for stormwater management. 
Section 700.0. Design criteria, standards, and methods. 
(a)  Release rates. 
(1)  The drainage system for a property shall be designed to control the peak rate of discharge from the property for the 2-year, 24-hour and 100-year, 24-hour events to levels which will not cause an increase in flooding or channel instability downstream when considered in aggregate with other developed properties and downstream drainage capacities. The peak discharge from events less than or equal to the 2-year event shall not be greater than 0.04 cfs per acre of property drained. The peak 100-year discharge shall not be greater than 0.15 cfs per acre of property drained. The peak 100-year discharge shall not be greater than 0.15 cfs per acre of property drained. 
(2)  Should downstream sewers, streams and channels be found by the village engineer to be inadequate to receive the release rate provided herein, the allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the receiving downstream sewers and channels. Additional detention, as determined by the village engineer, shall be required to store that portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving sewers and channels. 
(b)  (1)  Detention basin outlet design. Backwater on the outlet structure from the downstream drainage system shall be evaluated when designing the outlet. 
(2)  Detention basin outlet connections. Detention basin outlets cannot be connected to farm drains and tiles, except for extended detention discharges. 
(c)  Detention storage requirements. The design maximum storage to be provided in a detention basin shall be based on the runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour event and reservoir (also called modified plus or level pool) routing or equal. Detention storage shall be computed using hydrograph methods as described in this section. 
(d)  Drainage system design and evaluation. The following criteria should be used in evaluating and designing the drainage system. The underlying objective is to provide capacity to pass the 10-year peak flow in the minor drainage system and an overload flow path for flows in excess of the design capacity. 
(1)  Design methodologies: 
a.  Major and minor conveyance systems for all tributary areas ten (10) acres or less may be designed using the rational method. 
b.  Major drainage systems for all tributary areas greater than ten (10) acres must be designed using runoff hydrograph methods as described in section 700.0(e) with release rates not to exceed 0.04 cfs/acre for the 2-year storm and 0.15 cfs/acre for the 100-year storm. Detention facilities for all sites five (5) acres or larger must be designed using runoff hydrograph methods as described in section 700.0(e). Detention facilities for sites less than five (5) acres may be designed using the modified rational method. 
c.  The rational method may be used in sizing the minor drainage system for all sites. 
d.  If in the opinion of the village engineer release rates less than those outlined above are required due to downstream conveyance limitations, those release rates shall be used. 
(2)  Positive drainage: Whenever practicable, all areas of the property must be provided an overland flow path that will pass the 100-year flow at a stage at least one (1) foot below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of the flow path. Overland flow paths designed to handle flows in excess of the minor drainage system capacity shall be provided drainage easements. All drainage easements shall prohibit the placing of sandboxes, above grade planters, nonflow-through fences, and other obstructions across these overland flow paths. Street ponding and flow depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one (1) inch. 
(e)  Methods for generating runoff hydrographs. Runoff hydrographs shall be developed incorporating the following assumptions of rainfall amounts and antecedent moisture. 
(1)  Rainfall: Unless a continuous simulation approach to drainage system hydrology is used, all design rainfall events shall be based on the Illinois State Water Survey's Bulletin 70. The first quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and analysis of conveyance systems with critical durations less than or equal to twelve (12) hours. The third quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and analysis of detention basins and conveyance system with critical durations greater than twelve (12) and less than or equal to twenty-four (24) hours. The forth quartile distribution shall be used in the design and analysis of systems with durations greater than twenty-four (24) hours. The first, third and fourth quartile distributions described by Huff are presented in Table 37 of Bulletin 70. The SCS Type II distribution may be used as an alternate to the Huff distributions. The effects of a sixteen (16) inch, eighteen (18) hour SCS Type II rainfall shall also be assessed so as to predict the operation of the system during an event similar to the July 1996 (or current) rainfall of record. But this event need not be considered as the design condition. 
(2)  Antecedent moisture: Computations of runoff hydrographs which do not rely on a continuous accounting of antecedent moisture conditions shall assume a minimum antecedent moisture condition of two (2). 
(f)  Wet detention basin design. Wet detention basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as much as feasible to be available for recreational use. Designs incorporating wetland establishment to further control pollutants, increase aesthetics and provide recreational opportunities are encouraged. 
(1)  Wet basin depths: Wet basins shall be at least three (3) feet deep, excluding near shore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided they shall be at least ten (10) feet deep over twenty-five (25) percent of the bottom area to prevent winter freeze out. 
(2)  Wet basin shoreline slopes: The side slopes of wet basins at the normal pool elevation shall not be steeper than five (5) to one (1) (horizontal and vertical). 
(3)  Permanent pool volume: The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at normal depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the 2-year event. 
(4)  Inlet and outlet orientation: To the extent feasible, the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin and located to avoid short-circuiting. The use of paved low flow channels is discouraged. 
(g)  Wetland and dry detention basin design. In addition to the other requirements of this ordinance, wetland and dry basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and as much as feasible to be available for multiple uses. 
(1)  Wetland and dry basin drainage: Dry basins shall be designed so that the portion of their bottom area which is intended to be dry shall have standing water no longer than seventy-two (72) hours for any runoff event less than the 100-year event. Under drains directed to the outlet may be used to accomplish this requirement. Grading plans shall clearly distinguish the wet/wetland portion of the basin from the dry portion. 
(2)  Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation measures shall be incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize the resuspension of pollutants. 
(3)  Inlet and outlet orientation: To the extent feasible, the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin. 
(4)  Stilling/sedimentation basins: A stilling/sedimentation basin should be constructed at each major inlet to a wetland or dry basin consistent with section 700.0(j)(4). 
(h)  Reserved. 
(i)  Detention in floodplains. The placement of detention basins within the floodplain is strongly discouraged because of questions about their reliable operation during flood events. However, the stormwater detention requirements of this ordinance may be fulfilled by providing detention storage within flood fringe areas on the project site provided the following provisions are met. 
(1)  Detention in flood fringe areas: The placement of a detention basin in a flood fringe area shall require compensatory storage for one and one-half (11/2) times the volume below the base flood elevation occupied by the detention basin including any berms. The release from the detention storage provided shall still be controlled consistent with the requirements of this section. The applicant shall demonstrate its operation for all stream flow and floodplain backwater conditions. Excavations for compensatory storage along watercourses shall be opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention. All floodplain storage lost below the 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All compensatory storage excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
(2)  Detention in floodways: Detention basins shall be placed in the floodway only in accordance with subsection (3) below. 
(3)  On-stream detention: On-stream detention basins are discouraged but allowable if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other provisions of this ordinance with respect to water quality and control of the 2-year and 100-year, 24-hour events from the property. Further criteria are presented in section 800.0 of this ordinance. If on-stream detention is used for watersheds larger than one (1) square mile, it is recommended that the applicant use dynamic modeling to demonstrate that the design will not increase stage for any properties upstream or downstream of the property. Also impoundment of the stream as part of on-stream detention: 
a.  Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
b.  Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality or stream aquatic habitat; 
c.  Shall include a design calling for gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin; 
d.  Shall not involve any stream channelization or the filling of wetlands; 
e.  Shall require the implementation of an effective nonpoint source management program throughout the upstream watershed; 
f.  Shall not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge; and 
g.  Shall comply with 92 Illinois Administrative Code Parts 702 and 708 and the floodplain ordinance of the village. 
(j)  Drainage into wetlands. Existing wetlands shall be protected from damaging modifications and adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated with land developments. In addition to the other requirements of this ordinance, the following requirements shall be met for all developments whose drainage flows into wetlands. 
(1)  Detention wetlands: Existing wetlands shall not be modified for the purposes of stormwater detention unless it is demonstrated that the existing wetland is low in quality and the proposed modifications will improve its habitat and ability to perform beneficial functions. Existing depressional storage in wetlands shall be maintained and the volume of detention storage provided to meet the requirements of this section shall be in addition to this existing storage. Establishment of new emergent wetlands to accept drainage from stormwater detention systems are encouraged as a benefit to aesthetics, pollution control and recreational opportunity. 
(2)  Sediment control: The existing wetland shall be protected during construction by appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures and shall not be filled. 
(3)  Alteration of drainage patterns: Site drainage patterns shall not be altered to substantially decrease or increase the existing area tributary to the wetland. 
(4)  Detention/sedimentation: All runoff from the development shall be routed through a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin incorporating pollutant removal functions and designed to capture the 2-year, 24-hour event and hold it for at least twenty-four (24) hours, before being discharged to the wetland. The area of the basin shall be at least five hundred (500) square feet per acre of impervious surface in the drainage area. Side slopes shall be no steeper than three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical and basin depths should be at least three (3) feet to minimize resuspension of accumulated sediment. This basin shall be constructed before property grading begins. In addition, the drainage hierarchy defined in section 500.0 should be followed to minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged to the wetland. 
(5)  Vegetated buffer strip: A buffer strip of at least twenty-five (25) feet in width, preferable vegetated with native plant species, shall be maintained or restored around the periphery of the wetland. 
(6)  Vegetated filter strips and swales: To effectively filter stormwater pollutants and promote infiltration of runoff, sites should be designed to maximize the use of vegetated filter strips and swales. Wherever practicable, runoff from impervious surfaces should be directed onto filter strips and swales before being routed to a storm sewer or detention basin. 
(k)  Street, parking lot, and culvert damage. 
(1)  Streets: If streets are to be used as part of the minor or major drainage system, ponding depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one (1) inch and shall not remain flooded for more than eight (8) hours for any event less than or equal to the 100-year event. 
(2)  Parking lots: The maximum stormwater ponding depth in any parking area shall not exceed six (6) inches for more than four (4) hours. 
(3)  Culvert road and driveway crossings: Sizing of culvert crossing shall consider entrance and exit losses as well as tailwater conditions on the culvert. 
(l)  Infiltration practices. To effectively reduce runoff volumes, infiltration practices including basins, trenches, and porous pavement should be located on soils in hydrologic soil groups "A" or "B" as designated by the U.S. Soil Conservation Services. Infiltration basins and trenches designed to recharge groundwater shall not be located within seventy-five (75) feet of a water supply well or a building foundation. A sediment settling basin shall be provided to remove coarse sediment from stormwater flows before they reach infiltration basins or trenches. Stormwater shall not be allowed to stand more than seventy-two (72) hours over eighty (80) percent of a dry basin's bottom area for the maximum design event to be ex-filtrated. The bottom of infiltration facilities shall be a minimum of four (4) feet above seasonally high groundwater and bedrock. 
Redundant release structures need to be provided for the 2-year, 24-hour, and 100-year, 24-hour events, with release rates per section 700.0(a)(1). Infiltration rate shall be based on a qualified soils engineer's analysis of the site, and confirmation that the actual conditions at the infiltration surface match those in the analysis. In the case of wet-bottom detention facilities, provisions shall be made to infiltrate water during fluctuating groundwater levels. 
(m)  Safety considerations. The drainage system components, especially all detention basins, shall be designed to protect the safety of any children or adults coming in contract with the system during runoff events. 
(1)  Side slopes: The side slopes of all detention basins at 100-year capacity shall be a level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. Side slopes of detention basins and open channels shall not be steeper than three (3) to one (1) (horizontal to vertical). 
(2)  Safety ledge: All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge at least six (6) feet in width two and one-half (21/2) to three (3) feet below the normal water depth. 
(3)  Velocity: Velocities throughout the surface drainage system shall be controlled to safe levels taking into consideration rate and depths of flow. 
(4)  Overflow structures: All stormwater detention basins shall be provided with an overflow structure capable of safely passing excess flows at a stage at least one (1) foot below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of the detention basin. The design flow rate of the overflow structure shall be equivalent to the 100-year inflow rate. 
The existing 100-year peak rate of runoff from the area naturally tributary to the detention pond outfall shall not be exceeded if the restrictor is blocked. 
(n)  Maintenance considerations. The stormwater drainage system shall be designed to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed side slopes shall be designed to allow lawn mowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins shall be provided with alternate outflows which can be used to completely drain the pool for sediment removal. (Pumping may be considered if drainage by gravity is not feasible.) Pre-sedimentation basins shall be included, where feasible, for localizing sediment deposition and removal. Access for heavy equipment shall be provided. 
(o)  Extended detention requirement. The requirements of this section will apply only when an existing agricultural land use is downstream of and adjacent to a site runoff storage facility outlet. The runoff from a three-quarter (0.75) inch rainfall event over the hydraulically connected impervious area of the new development shall be stored below the elevation of the primary gravity outlet (extended detention) of the site runoff storage facility. The facility may be designed to allow for evapotranspiration or infiltration of this volume into a subsurface drainage system and shall not be conveyed through a direct positive connection to downstream areas. 
The hydraulically connected impervious area used in the calculation of required extended detention volume may be reduced by the administrator if the soils are prepared to maximize infiltration and deep rooted grasses or other plants selected for their ability to promote infiltration or water absorption are planted in areas appropriately dedicated. The reduction in hydraulically connected impervious area used in the calculation shall be equal to the area of the development meeting the above soils/native planting requirement. 
Subsurface drainage systems may be designed as a component of the extended detention portion of the detention basin to assist in infiltration in accordance with the following criteria: 
(1)  The extended detention volume shall be discharged at a rate no greater than that required to empty the calculated extended detention volume with five (5) days of the storm event. 
(2)  No subsurface drainage pipe shall be located within ten (10) feet of drainage pipes directly connected to the detention basin. 
(3)  For purposes of meeting the maximum subsurface drainage discharge requirements, control orifices and weirs bay be used. 
(4)  All design extended detention volume shall be provided above the seasonal high ground water table or the invert elevation of the ground water control system. 
(5)  Farm field tile shall not be considered a subsurface drainage system. 
(p)  Detention on sites where depressional storage exists. For sites where depressional storage exists and the undeveloped release rate for the area tributary to the natural depression is less than the maximum release rate in section 700.0(a)(1), the developed release rate and corresponding storage volume for that portion of the site tributary to the natural depression shall be based on the existing undeveloped release rate from the natural depression. The runoff from off-site areas tributary to the natural depression shall be calculated using the existing conditions for these off-site areas. 
(q)  Storage facilities shall facilitate sedimentation and catchment of floating material. Unless specifically approved by the administrator, concrete-lined low-flow ditches shall not be used in detention basins. 
Section 800.0. The bypass system. 
    The bypass system shall be designed to comply with the requirements of section 7-183 of the Subdivision Control Ordinance. Design capacity shall be predicated on the assumption that all upstream areas have been fully developed as proposed in the Plainfield Official Plan and/or the Will County Comprehensive Plan. The bypass flow rate shall be computed using a runoff coefficient of not less than 0.35. An allowance, equivalent to the reduction in the flow rate provided, will be made for upstream detention that has been previously approved by the village and/or Will County and that has been constructed. (See section 700.0) 
    Bypass channels may be incorporated into lot or improvement designs as follows: 
(1)  Drainage ways may be provided in a depressed median of a double roadway, street, or parkway, provided the median is wide enough to permit flat side slopes along the storm channel. 
(2)  A continuous easement shall be provided along rear lot lines within which utility lines and drainage facilities may be located and maintained, but within no accessory buildings and/or obstructing structures may be located. 
(3)  Any such bypass drainage way shall be provided with an easement at least twelve (12) feet wide, six (6) feet on each side of a lot line where applicable. Such an easement will permit necessary public channel maintenance and improvement. 
    Where development of a property presents the threat of flooding or damage by flash runoff to downstream residents, the facilities for storm water runoff control shall be constructed prior to any earth moving or drainage constructed on the project side. 
Section 900.0. Early completion of detention facilities. 
    Where detention, retention, or depressional storage areas are to be used as part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be constructed as the first element of the initial earthwork program. Any eroded sediment captured in these facilities shall be removed by the applicant before project completion in order to maintain the design volume of the facilities. 
Section 1000.0. Stormwater requirements for agricultural land use including croplands, pasture lands and farmsteads. 
    Applicability: Regulations under this section apply only to croplands, pasturelands, farmsteads, and outbuildings associated with those agricultural practices. Compliance with the requirements of this section shall be construed as compliance with the stormwater ordinance for the above land uses and no further regulation under the ordinance will apply. Any other land use, including greenhouses, nurseries, container grown plants, equestrian facilities, the sale of agricultural products to the public or where commercial activities involving the new construction of gravel or paved parking facilities or buildings whose aggregate area is twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet or more are required to comply with all applicable sections of this ordinance. 
(1)  Conservation planning and performance standards. To comply with this section, landowners shall practice conservation planning whose product shall be a management system, which addresses site runoff, soil erosion and sediment control, surface and subsurface drainage. Any acreage with a signed and approved NRCS Conservation Plan is exempt fro the requirements of this section and the ordinance. 
Applicable approved practices include: 
a.  Vegetated grass waterways; 
b.  Contour buffer strips; 
c.  Critical area planting and cover crops; 
d.  Terrace ridges and diversions; 
e.  Contour strip cropping; 
f.  Contour framing; 
g.  Crop rotation; 
h.  Conservation tillage and crop residue management; and 
i.  Other standard practices for conservation planning in accordance with the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide (current edition) or as otherwise approved by the Will County NRCS District Conservationist or the Will County Agricultural Administrator. 
The performance standard for conservation planning shall be a management system which will develop a set of field practices which will reduce the calculated actual soil loss to the "tolerable soil loss" (T) as calculated by the revised universal soil loss equation of the actual site conditions. Cropland tillage and resource management methods shall be consistent with the Technical Guide Notice IL-108 and shall be considered evidence of compliance with the "T" performance standard. 
(2)  Drainage practices, requirements and design criteria. Drainage for agricultural purposes shall be consistent with those practices identified as appropriate for the "good husbandry" given the soil types, slopes and crops. An agricultural drainage system may consist of both subsurface drainage systems and surface drainage systems. Where active drainage districts maintain drainage systems, they shall be consulted on surface and subsurface drainage within the district boundaries. Requirements applying to subsurface and surface drainage system shall be as follows: 
a.  Subsurface drainage systems. Drain tile systems shall be maintained and constructed in accordance with subsurface drainage recommendations for the appropriate soil drainage group as specified by The Illinois Drainage Guide, University of Illinois Extension Service Circular No. 1226. Surface inlets into the subsurface drainage system shall be allowed only to maintain good husbandry. Where their use cannot be practicably avoided due to topography, they shall be installed using flow controls such as orifices and perforated risers with gravel filters and / or vegetative filters. 
b.  Surface drainage systems. Surface drainage systems shall be maintained and constructed in accordance with surface drainage recommendations for the appropriate soil drainage group as specified by the Illinois Drainage Guide, University of Illinois Extension Service No. 1226. Surface drainage systems shall be built with geotechnically stable slopes and the surface when applicable shall be further stabilized utilizing the establishment of cool and warm season grass mixes as identified in Field Office Technical Guide (Illinois 108). 
c.  Buffer strips. Open channels with a definable bed and banks shall use buffer strips in order to reduce the amount of erosion occurring from the conveyed flows as well as to help filter the runoff from the site into the waterway. Buffer strips shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet wide from the top of bank except where smaller widths are necessary due to site limitations and when approved by the administrator. 
d.  Agricultural drainage systems shall also comply with all regulations regarding wetlands as enforced by federal, state, and local agencies. 
(3)  Sediment control for open channels. All open channel drainage systems shall maintain practices adjacent to the open outlet channel that will reduce the transportation of sediment off-site. Runoff from agricultural fields must pass through a sediment control system prior to discharge into the open channel conveyance system. Approved sediment control systems may consist of the following: 
a.  Vegetated buffer zones planted with permanent grasses appropriate for soil stabilization and filtering; 
b.  Grade control structures for over fall stabilization; 
c.  Sediment traps adjacent to the stream channel; 
d.  Other standard practices for conservation planning in accordance with the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide (current edition) or as otherwise approved by the Will County NRCS District Conservationist or the administrator. 
(4)  Maintenance and construction of drainage systems. Agricultural drainage systems shall be maintained so as to convey the expected flows for good drainage practices. The existing agricultural surface drainage systems shall not be enlarged unless such enlargement is consistent with all other sections of this section. Maintenance and construction of subsurface drainage systems will not be subject to the requirements of other sections of this ordinance except as they are regulated by other agencies. Maintenance projects by legally functioning drainage districts on existing agricultural drainage systems will not be subject to further permitting requirements under this ordinance except as they relate to the jurisdiction of other agencies. 
Section 1100.0. Maintenance responsibility. 
    Maintenance of stormwater drainage facilities located on private property shall be the responsibility of the owner of that property. Before a construction permit is obtained from the village, the applicant shall execute a maintenance agreement with the village guaranteeing that the applicant and all future owners of the property will maintain its stormwater drainage system. The maintenance agreement shall also specifically authorize representatives of the village to enter on to the property for the purpose of inspections and maintenance of the drainage system. Such agreement shall be recorded with the Record of Deeds of Will County. The maintenance agreement shall include a schedule for regular maintenance of each aspect of the property's stormwater drainage system and shall provide for access to the system for inspection by authorized personnel of the village. The maintenance agreement shall also stipulate that if the village attorney notifies the property owner in writing of maintenance problems which require correction, the property owner shall make such corrections within thirty (30) calendar days of such notification. If the corrections are not made within this time period the village may have the necessary work completed and assess the cost to the property owner. 
    The village has the option of requiring a bond to be filed by the property owner for maintenance of the stormwater drainage system. 
(1)  Long-term maintenance. Unless maintenance responsibility has been delegated to and accepted by another qualified entity under this section, the owner shall maintain that portion of a stormwater drainage system located upon his land. With the approval of the administrator the stormwater drainage system, or specified portions thereof, may be: 
a.  Dedicated or otherwise transferred to and accepted by the permitting community or other public entity; 
b.  Conveyed or otherwise transferred to and accepted by a homeowner's association, or similar entity, the members of which are to be the owners of all of the lots or parcels comprising the development; or 
c.  Conveyed to one (1) or more persons or in one (1) or more undivided interests to one (1) or more persons. 
Except for those portions of a stormwater drainage system to be dedicated or otherwise transferred to the permitting authority or other public entity, included in the application for a stormwater permit shall be a plan for the long-term management, operation and maintenance of the stormwater drainage system and a description of the sources of funding therefore. Amendments to the plan must be approved by the administrator. 
(2)  Transfer to permitting authority or other public entity. If any portion of the stormwater drainage system is to be dedicated or otherwise transferred to the permitting authority or other public entity under section 1100.0(1)a., appropriate easements for ingress and egress to and maintenance of such portions shall be reserved for the benefit of such entity on the final plat. 
(3)  Transfer to homeowner's or similar association. If any portion of the stormwater drainage system is to be conveyed or otherwise transferred to a homeowner's or similar association under section 1100.0(1)b. then: 
a.  Appropriate easements for ingress and egress to and maintenance of such portions shall be reserved for the benefit of such association and the permitting authority on the final plat; 
b.  The association shall be duly incorporated and a copy of the certificate of incorporation, duly recorded, and bylaws, and any amendment to either of them, shall be delivered to the administrator; 
c.  The bylaws of the association shall, at a minimum, contain: 
1.  A provision acknowledging and accepting the association's obligation to maintain certain portions of the stormwater drainage system as required by this ordinance; 
2.  A mechanism for imposing an assessment upon the owners of all of the lots or parcels comprising the development sufficient, at a minimum, to provide for the maintenance of those portions of the stormwater drainage system as required by this ordinance and the payment of all taxes levied thereon; 
3.  A provision adopting the plan of long term maintenance set forth in the application for a stormwater management permit, with approved amendments; 
4.  A provision identifying the officer of the association responsible for carrying out the obligations imposed upon the association under this ordinance, and an obligation to inform the administrator of the name, address and phone number of this officer and any changes thereto; 
5.  A provision requiring the consent of the permitting authority to any amendment of the bylaws changing any of the provisions of the bylaws required by this ordinance; and 
6.  A provision requiring the consent of the permitting authority to the dissolution of the association. 
d.  Any conveyance or other instrument of transfer delivered under section 1100.0(1)b. shall include a covenant affirmatively imposing upon the association's affirmative acceptance thereof. 
(4)  Conveyance to one (1) or more persons. If any portion of the stormwater drainage system is to be conveyed to one (1) or more persons under section 1100.0(1)c., then: 
a.  Appropriate easements for ingress and egress to and maintenance of such portions shall be reserved for the benefit of the permitting authority on the final plat; 
b.  The final plat shall contain a legend imposing the maintenance obligations of this section upon the grantee and his successors in interest as a covenant running with the land and incorporating by reference the plan of long term maintenance set forth in the application for a stormwater management permit, with approved amendments; 
c.  The final plat shall contain a legend reserving the right of the permitting authority to enter upon the land to perform the maintenance required in this section if the owner does not do so and to place a lien against the land for the cost thereof; 
d.  Any conveyance delivered under section 600(c), and any subsequent conveyance, shall include a covenant imposing upon the grantee the obligations, restrictions and provisions set forth in this section and the grantee's affirmative acceptance thereof. 
(5)  Incorporation of maintenance obligations in stormwater management permit. The provisions of this section shall be incorporated by reference in the stormwater management permit and the applicant's acceptance of the permit shall be deemed to be the applicant's acceptance and assumption of the obligations imposed under this section. At the option of the administrator, the stormwater management permit may be recorded. 
(6)  Funding a long term maintenance of stormwater facilities. As a condition of approval of any application for a stormwater management permit, unless the maintenance responsibility for the stormwater drainage system to be constructed or installed in connection therewith has been accepted by a public entity, the administrator will require assurance of long-term funding in a form found acceptable to the permitting authority. A corporation with a bond rating of "A" or higher from a major investment firm (i.e. Standard and Poor, Moody or equivalent) will be considered to have met the long-term maintenance funding requirement. Absent some other form of agreement, then the administrator shall require the establishment of a special service area pursuant to 35 ILCS 200/27-5, et seq. either as the primary means of providing for the long term maintenance of the facilities, or as a backup vehicle in the even the entity designated by the applicant as having primary maintenance responsibility fails to adequately carry out its duties. 
If the establishment of a special service area is required, the administrator shall make consider and approve a good faith estimate by the applicant of the tax rate required to produce a tax to be levied upon all taxable property within the area, sufficient for the long term maintenance of the facilities and submit the same to the permitting authority which shall incorporate such rate into its enactment of the ordinances necessary for the establishment of the area. The ordinances to be enacted by the permitting authority shall be substantially in the form set forth in Appendix F. 
On or before August 1 of each year thereafter, the administrator shall submit to the permitting authority a good faith estimate of the amount of tax required to be levied upon all taxable property within the area for the next fiscal year for the continued maintenance of the stormwater drainage system. 
Editor's note- Appendix F is not set out herein, but is on file and available for inspection in the village offices. 
Section 1200.0. Administration.

(1)  Inspections during construction: General site grading shall not begin until any necessary detention facilities are in place and operational. The village building official or his representative will also conduct periodic inspections of the work in progress to be certain that the drainage system is being built as designed. If any violations of the provisions or requirements of this ordinance are noted during such inspections, the village building official shall notify the property owner in writing of the items needing correction. The property owner shall be given ten (10) calendar days to make such corrections unless given a specific extension of time in writing by the village building official. 
Failure to complete such corrections within the specified time period shall constitute a violation of this ordinance. 
(2)  Final inspection: Upon notification by the applicant that the drainage system is completed, the village engineer or his representative shall conduct a final inspection. If the drainage system is found to contain deficiencies which require correction the village shall notify the property owner of the necessary corrections. The property owner shall correct such deficiencies within ten (10) calendar days unless given a specific extension of time in writing by the village. Failure to make necessary corrections within the specified time period shall constitute a violation of this ordinance. Upon finding that the drainage system meets the provisions and requirements of this ordinance the village engineer shall issue a written report of drainage system completion to the village president and board of trustees. The village shall notify the property owner of satisfactory completion. 
(3)  Routine inspections: All privately owned drainage systems shall be inspected by representatives of the village not less often than once per year. A written report shall be filed of the results of any inspection and a copy sent to the property owner detailing any problems which need correction. 
(b)  Enforcement. The administration and enforcement of this ordinance shall be the responsibility of the planning and building department of the village. 
(c)  Appeals. All appeals to the village engineer, village building official or village planner's decisions regarding the interpretation of this ordinance shall be heard by the village president and board of trustees of the village.

DIVISION 10. - PARKS, SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC AREAS 

Sec. 7-226. - Designation of areas. 
    Whenever the reasonable requirement provided by the official plan indicates the necessity for providing for a school site, park site or other public lands within any proposed subdivision for which approval has been requested and no such provision has been made therefore, the governing authorities may require that land be designated for such public purpose before approving such plat. 
(Ord. No. 2091, § 3-11-1, 2-25-02) 
Sec. 7-227. - Limit on taking areas. 
    Whenever a final plat of subdivision, or part thereof, has been approved by the governing authorities as complying with the official plan and there is designated therein a school site, park site or other public land, the governing authorities having jurisdiction of such use, be it a school board, park board, or other authority, shall acquire the land so designated by purchase or commence proceedings to acquire such land by condemnation within one (1) year from the date of approval of such plat; and if it does not do so within such period of one (1) year, the land so designated may then be used by the owners thereof in any other manner consistent with this article, including the official plan and zoning ordinance of the village. 
(Ord. No. 2091, § 3-11-2, 2-25-02) 
Sec. 7-228. - Regard for natural features in area designation. 
    In subdividing any land within the village or within one and one-half (11/2) mile unincorporated area due regard shall be shown for all natural features such as tree growth, water courses, historic spots, or similar conditions which, if preserved, will add attractiveness to the proposed development. 
(Ord. No. 2091, § 3-11-3, 2-25-02) 
Sec. 7-229. - School sites. 
(a)  Dedication of school sites or for payments of fees in lieu thereof. As a condition of approval of final plat of subdivision, or of a final plat of a planned unit development, or in application for permit for mobile home park, each subdivider developer, or builder of a planned unit development or mobile home park, will be required to dedicate land for school sites, to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, or make a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both, in accordance with the following criteria and formula: 
(1)  Criteria for requiring school site dedication: 
a.  Requirement and population ratio. The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development or mobile home park shall bear directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of (1) estimated children to be served in each school classification as determined in accordance with the data for the estimated number of children entering school per type of dwelling unit found in the latest edition of the Illinois School Consulting Service Reports over the (2) maximum recommended number of acres of land needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increased number of children in each such school classification. The recommended number of acres of land needed for school sites is obtained from Recommendations For Elementary and High School School Spaces, published by the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, State of Illinois, Springfield, Illinois. If cash contribution is required, the following formula shall be used: 
Cost of a square foot of land as determined in accordance with section 7-229(2)b. hereof multiplied by the number of square feet per pupil per school classification as determined in accordance with section 7-229(1)b. hereof equals the cost per child. 
b.  School classifications and size of school site. School classifications and size of school sites within the county shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria: 
School 
Classification 
by Grades Max. Number 
of Students 
for each 
such School 
Classification Min. Number 
of Acres of 
Land for each 
School Site 
of such 
Classification Elementary Schools 600 students 11 acres Junior High Schools 900 students 29 acres Senior High Schools 1,500 
students 45 acres  
The Comprehensive School Plan and/or the standards adopted by the Plainfield Community Consolidated School District No. 202, Illinois or Oswego Community Unit School District No. 308, Illinois, depending on which district the development is located, (hereafter referred to as school district) shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. 
(2)  Criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of a school site: 
a.  Where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for a school site, the village, with the recommendation of the board of education of the school district, affected, shall require the subdivider, developer or builder, to pay a cash contribution in lieu of land dedication required. The word small in this section is defined as a total number of proposed dwelling units that will produce less than the maximum number of students for one school of each school classification as set forth in section 7-229(1)b., School classification and size of school site. 
The determination that available land is inappropriate for a school site shall be made by the village after inspection of the land by the superintendent of the school district, and after hearing the recommendation of the school board for the school district, and any builder, subdivider or developer affected. Any builder, subdivider or developer affected may request a hearing before the village board on the question of whether the proposed land is inappropriate as a school site. Any builder, subdivider or developer affected as well as the school board of the school district may present evidence at said hearing and in addition, the village board, in its discretion, may hear evidence from other interested persons. 
b.  The school district, if it is to be recipient of funds under this section, shall prior to July 1st of each year establish an average valuation indicating current market value of improved property within the school district. This valuation shall be for a parcel of land meeting such standards of topography, soil condition, access, and improvements as are determined by the local school board, and shall be of such minimum size as established by the recommendations of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
(3)  Criteria for requiring dedication and a fee. There will be situations in subdivision, planned unit developments or mobile home parks when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise when: 
a.  Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a school site. That portion of the land within the subdivision, planned unit development or mobile home park falling within the school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated. 
(4)  Density formula. The table of population density contained in attached Exhibit "A" is generally indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size for new construction as determined by the Illinois School Consulting Service, and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer or builder with the village board. 
In the event a subdivider, developer or builder files a written objection to the Table of Estimated Student Population, listed herein in Exhibit "A" he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development or mobile home park. In that event, final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculation, shall be made by the village board after a hearing. At such hearing, the builder, subdivider or developer, the school district, and other interested persons, in the discretion of the village board, may present demographic information. The population density formula and the specific formula for the dedication of land or payment of fees in lieu thereof, will be based on the latest available data of the Illinois School Consulting Service and the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. It shall be presumed that the subdivider, developer, or builder intends to construct units with the maximum school age population density permitted by the ordinances of the village. This presumption may be overcome by the subdivider, developer or builder specifying the units which shall be constructed.

(5)  Reservation of additional land. Where the comprehensive plan or the standards of the village and/or the County of Will shall call for a larger amount for school sites in a particular subdivision or planned unit development or mobile home park than the developer is required to dedicate, the land needed beyond the developer's contribution shall be reserved for subsequent purchase by the village or other public body designated by the village provided that such acquisition is made within one (1) year from the date of approval of the final plat or the issuance of such permit. 
(6)  Combining with adjoining developments. Where the subdivision, planned unit development or builder or mobile home park is less than forty (40) acres, a school site which is to be dedicated, should, where possible, be combined with dedications for adjoining developments in order to produce usable school sites without a hardship on a particular developer. 
(7)  Topography and grading. The slope, topography and geology of the dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended purposes. 
(8)  Improved sites. All sites shall be improved in accordance with requirements of the ordinances of the village or the requirements imposed thereunder by the village board with the recommendation of the plan commission. 
(9)  Time of conveyance or payment. Subdivider or developer shall convey to the respective school districts the land required under this agreement within thirty (30) days after any subdivision plat or final plat of a planned unit development is recorded in the recorder's office of the appropriate county: Kendall and/or Will County, Illinois. All improvements shall be completed within such time as required by the village. A subdivider, developer or builder shall make any cash contributions required under this section upon the issuance of any building permit by the village. 
Payments shall be made directly to the school district or districts wherein the development, subdivision or building is located and evidence of said payment shall be made at the time of application for the building permit. 
The amount of each payment of cash shall be determined by the village and subdivider, and/or developer at the time of the approval of the final subdivision plat or final plat of a planned unit development or conditional permitted use for a mobile home park. The schedule of payments shall be filed in the recorder's office of the appropriate county Kendall and/or Will County, Illinois, and in the office of the village clerk. 
(10)  Collection of monies. The village shall have the right to delegate the responsibility for collecting monies due under this section to other public bodies designated by the village. 
(b)  Right of the village to elect to use site for other purposes. The village shall have the right to elect to use for public recreational purposes without charge on any land dedicated to the school district affected, provided, and during such period of time, said lands are not then used for school purposes. School district may terminate the village's right to use any parcel of land for park purposes by giving the village six (6) months written notice of the school district's intent to use said land for school purposes at that time. Upon electing to use said land, village shall furnish evidence of public liability insurance covering the village and school district in an amount equal to that carried by the school district. 
    Nothing herein shall prevent the village from assigning privileges and duties stated herein to the Plainfield Township Park District or Oswegoland Park District, subject however to the terms hereof. 
(c)  Severability. If any provisions of the section, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is declared invalid by a court or competent jurisdiction, such partial invalidity shall not affect without the invalid provision or application thereof, and to this extent the provisions of this section are declared to be severable. 
(d)  Hold harmless. Any public body designated by the village to receive the cash contribution required hereunder or to be the grantee of any conveyance required hereunder shall agree to indemnify and hold the village harmless from any costs, fees, cash payments or land conveyances required by any court of competent jurisdiction if any part of this section is held invalid.

If the preceding sentence in this paragraph or the application thereof is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, the amount of tax due as a consequence of such holding shall be limited to the amount that the taxpayer is authorized to charge and collect from such school districts and units of local government pursuant the provisions of section 9-221 of the Public Utilities Act or any successor thereto. 
    Persons means any natural individual, firm, trust, estate, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint adventure, corporation, limited liability company, municipal corporation, the state or any of its political subdivisions, any state university created by statute, or a receiver, trustee, guardian or other representative appointed by order of any court. 
(b)  Tax imposed. A tax is imposed on all persons engaged in the following occupations or privileges: 
    Persons engaged in the business of distributing, supplying, furnishing, or selling gas for use or consumption within the corporate limits of the Village of Plainfield, and not for resale, at the rate of five (5) percent of the gross receipts therefrom. 
    No tax is imposed by this section with respect to any transaction in interstate commerce or otherwise to the extent to which such business may not, under the constitution and statutes of the United States, be made subject to taxation by the State of Illinois or any political subdivision thereof; nor shall any persons engaged in the business of distributing, supplying, furnishing or selling gas be subject to taxation under the provisions of this section for such transactions as are or may become subject to taxation under the provisions of the "Municipal Retailers' Occupation Tax Act" authorized by section 8-11-1 of the Illinois Municipal Code. 
(c)  Tax additional to other charges. The tax imposed by this section shall be in addition to the payment of money or value of products or services furnished to the village by the taxpayer as compensation for the use of its streets, alleys or other public places or installation and maintenance therein, thereon, or thereunder of poles, wires, pipes or other equipment used in the operation of the taxpayer's business. 
(d)  Effective date of tax. The tax imposed hereunder shall be based on the "gross receipts," as herein defined, actually paid to the taxpayer for service billed on or after February 1, 1996. 
(e)  Return by taxpayer. On or before the last day of each month, each taxpayer shall prepare and transmit to the village administrator a report or return covering the preceding calendar month, stating the following:

(3)  Gross receipts of taxpayer during the month covered by the report or return upon which the tax imposed hereunder is based; 
(4)  Amount of tax; 
(5)  Such other reasonable and related information as the village administrator may require. 
    On or before the last day of every month after February 1, 1996, every taxpayer shall make a like return covering the previous month to the village administrator. 
    The taxpayer making the return shall, at the time of transmitting such return to the village administrator, pay to the village administrator the amount of tax imposed hereunder; provided that in connection with any return the taxpayer may, at the taxpayer's election, report and pay an amount based upon the total billings of business subject to the tax during the period for which the return is made (exclusive of any amounts previously billed) with prompt adjustments of later payments based upon any differences between such billings and the taxable gross receipts. 
(f)  Overpayment. If it shall appear that an amount of tax has been paid which was not due under the provisions of this section whether as the result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be credited against any tax due, or to become due, under this section from the taxpayer who made the erroneous payment; provided no amounts erroneously paid more than three (3) years prior to the filing of a claim therefor shall be so credited. No action to recover any amount of tax due under the provisions of this section shall be commenced more than three (3) years after the due date of such amount. 
(g)  Fund. All tax receipts received by the village pursuant to this section shall be placed in a separate fund. 
(h)  Penalty. Any taxpayer who fails to make a return as herein required, or who makes a fraudulent return, or who willfully violates any other provision of this section, is guilty of an ordinance violation and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each offense, and in addition thereto shall be liable in a civil action for the amount of tax due.

(1)  Subject to the provision of subsection (f) regarding the delivery of electricity to resellers, the tax imposed under this section shall be collected from purchasers by the person maintaining a place of business in this state who delivers electricity to such purchasers. This tax shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the person who delivers the electricity to the purchaser and is recoverable at the same time and in the same manner as the original charge for delivering the electricity. 
(2)  Any tax required to be collected by this section, and any tax in fact collected, shall constitute a debt owed to the village by the person delivering the electricity, provided, that the person delivering electricity shall be allowed credit for such tax related to deliveries of electricity the charges for which are written off as uncollectible, and provided further, that if such charges are thereafter collected, the delivering supplier shall be obligated to remit such tax. 
(3)  Persons delivering electricity shall collect the tax from the purchaser by adding such tax to the gross charge for delivering the electricity. Persons delivering electricity shall also be authorized to add to such gross charge an amount equal to three (3) percent of the tax they collected to reimburse them for their expenses incurred in keeping records, billing customers, preparing for filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the village upon request.

(e)  Tax remittance and return. 
(1)  Every tax collector shall on a monthly basis file a return in a form prescribed by the village's administrator. The return and accompanying remittance shall be due on or before the last day of the month following the month during which the tax is collected. 
(2)  If the person delivering electricity fails to collect the tax from the purchaser, then the purchaser shall file a return in a form prescribed by the village's administrator and pay the tax directly to the village on or before the last day of the month following the month during which the electricity is used or consumed. 
(f)  Resales. 
(1)  Electricity that is delivered to a person in this village shall be considered to be for use and consumption by that person unless the person receiving the electricity has an active resale number issued by the village and furnishes that number to the person who delivers the electricity, and certifies to that person that the sale is either entirely or partially nontaxable as a sale for resale. 
(2)  If a person who receives electricity in the village claims to be an authorized reseller of electricity, that person shall apply to village for a resale number. The applicant shall state facts showing why it is not liable for the tax imposed by this section on any purchases of electricity and shall furnish such additional information as the village may reasonably require. 
(3)  Upon approval of the application, village shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify the number to the applicant. 
(4)  The village may cancel the resale number of any person if the person fails to pay any tax payable under this section for electricity used or consumed by the person, or if the number: 
a.  Was obtained through misrepresentation; or 
b.  Is no longer necessary because the person has discontinued making resales. 
(5)  If a reseller has acquired electricity partly for use or consumption and partly for resale the reseller shall pay the tax imposed by this section directly to the village pursuant to subsection (e) herein on the amount of electricity that the reseller uses or consumes and shall collect the tax pursuant to subsection (d) herein and remit the tax pursuant to subsection (e) herein on the amount of electricity delivered by the reseller to a purchaser. 
(6)  Any person who delivers electricity to a reseller having an active resale number and complying with all other conditions of this section shall be excused from collecting and remitting the tax on any portion of the electricity delivered to the reseller, provided that the person reports to the village the total amount of electricity delivered to the reseller and such other information that the village may reasonably require. 
(g)  Books and records. Every tax collector, and every taxpayer required to pay the tax imposed by this section shall keep accurate books and records of its business or activity including contemporaneous books and records denoting the transactions that gave rise or may have given rise, to any tax liability under this section. The books and records shall be subject to and available for inspection at all times during business hours of the day. 
(h)  Credits and refunds. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in order to permit sound fiscal planning and budgeting by the village no person shall be entitled to a refund of, or credit for a tax imposed under this section unless the person files a claim for refund or credit within three (3) years after the date on which the tax was paid or remitted.

In case credit is extended, the amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid. "Gross charges" for private line service shall include charges imposed at each channel termination point within this municipality and charges for that portion of the inter-office channels provided within this municipality. Charges for that portion of the inter-office channel connecting two (2) or more channel termination points, one (1) or more of which is located within the jurisdictional boundary of this municipality, shall be determined by the retailer by multiplying an amount equal to the total charge for the inter-office channel by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of channel termination points that are located within the jurisdictional boundary of this municipality and the denominator of which is the total number of channel termination points connected by the inter-office channel. However, "gross charge" shall not include any of the following: 
(1)  Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made pursuant to: (i) the tax imposed by this section, (ii) the tax imposed by the Telecommunications Excise Tax Act, (iii) the tax imposed by Section 4251 of the Internal Revenue Code, (iv) 911 surcharges, or (v) charges added to customers' bills pursuant to the provisions of Section 9-221 or 9-222 of the Public Utilities Act, as amended, or any similar charges added to customers' bills by retailers who are not subject to rate regulation by the Illinois Commerce Commission for the purpose of recovering any of the tax liabilities or other amounts specified in those provisions of the Public Utilities Act. 
(2)  Charges for a sent collect telecommunication received outside of such municipality. 
(3)  Charges for leased time on equipment or charges for the storage of data or information for subsequent retrieval or the processing of data or information intended to change its form or content.

A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the contest clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Act means the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, and regulations implementing such Act. 
    B.O.D. (biochemical oxygen demand) means the quantity of oxygen utilized in the biochemical oxidation of organic matter under standard laboratory procedures in five (5) days at twenty (20) degrees Celsius, expressed as mg/l. 
    Commercial user means a building discharging domestic wastes only and not classified as either an industrial or a residential user. 
    Customer includes but is not limited to the owner or occupant of the premises served and the user of the services supplied by the combined waterworks and sewerage system of the village having a water meter or a sewer connection or both. 
    Industrial user means any nongovernmental user of publicly owned treatment works identified in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1972, federal office of management and budget, as amended and supplemented, under the following divisions: 
(1)  Division A, agriculture, forestry and fishing; 
(2)  Division B, mining; 
(3)  Division D, manufacturing; 
(4)  Division E, transportation, communications, electric, gas, and sanitary services; 
(5)  Division G, retail trade; 
(6)  Division I, services. 
A user in the divisions listed above may be excluded if it is determined by the superintendent or the federal director that such user will introduce primarily segregated domestic wastes or wastes from sanitary conveniences and is not a major contributing industry as defined in this section. 
    Major contributing industry means an industrial user of the publicly owned treatment works that: (1) Has a flow of fifty thousand (50,000) gallons or more per average workday, or (2) or has a flow greater than five (5) percent of the flow carried by the municipal system receiving the waste, or (3) has in its waste a toxic pollutant in toxic amounts as defined in standards issued under section 307(a) of the Act, or (4) is found by the permit issuance authority, in connection with the issuance of an N.P.D.E.S. permit to the publicly owned treatment works receiving the waste to have a significant impact either singly or in combination with other contributing industries on that treatment works or upon the quality of effluent from that treatment works. 
    Milligrams per liter (mg/l) means a unit of the concentration of water or wastewater constituent. It is one-thousandths of a gram (g) of the constituent in one thousand (1,000) milliliters (ml) of water. It has replaced the unit formerly used commonly (parts per million ppm), to which it is approximately equivalent in reporting the results of water and wastewater analysis. 
    N.P.D.E.S. permit means any permit or equivalent document or requirements issued by the federal administrator, or, where appropriate by the federal director, after enactment of the federal water pollution control amendments of 1972, to regulate the discharge of pollutants pursuant to section 402 of the Act, on file in the office of the village clerk. 
    Population equivalent is a term used to evaluate the impact of industrial or other waste on a treatment works or stream. One (1) population equivalent of normal domestic sewage is one hundred (100) gallons of sewage per day, or seventeen one-hundredths (0.17) pounds of B.O.D. or twenty one-hundredths (0.20) pounds of suspended solids. The impact on a treatment works is evaluated as the equivalent of the highest of the three (3) parameters. The impact on a stream is the higher of the B.O.D. and suspended solids parameters. 
    Residential user means residences, including multiple dwellings, motels, hotels and trailers. 
    User charge means a charge levied on users of the treatment works and/or the waterworks for the cost of operation, maintenance, depreciation charges and all charges necessary to amortize the outstanding water and sewer revenue bonds.

    In the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, the village is authorized to enter upon the subject private property, without giving prior notice, to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. The village is authorized to seek costs of the abatement as outlined in section 8-206. 
(Ord. No. 2920, § 1, 2-1-10) 
Sec. 8-220. - Warning notice. 
    When the village finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, or any order issued hereunder, the village may serve upon that person a written warning notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the village to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a warning notice. 
(Ord. No. 2920, § 1, 2-1-10) 
Sec. 8-221. - Notice of violation. 
    Whenever the village finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this division, the village may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. 
    The notice of violation shall contain: 
(1)  The name and address of the alleged violator; 
(2)  The address when available or a description of the building, structure or land upon which the violation is occurring, or has occurred; 
(3)  A statement specifying the nature of the violation; 
(4)  A description of the remedial measures necessary to restore compliance with this division and a time schedule for the completion of such remedial action; 
(5)  A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed; 
(6)  A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to the village by filing a written notice of appeal within ten (10) business days of service of notice of violation; and 
(7)  A statement specifying that, should the violator fail to restore compliance within the established time schedule, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator. 
    Such notice may require without limitation: 
(1)  The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; 
(2)  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 
(3)  That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist; 
(4)  The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; 
(5)  Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and 
(6)  The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. 
(Ord. No. 2920, § 1, 2-1-10) 
Sec. 8-222. - Compensatory action. 
    In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this division, the village may impose upon the violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc. 
(Ord. No. 2920, § 1, 2-1-10) 
Sec. 8-223. - Suspension of MS4 access. 
(a)  Emergency cease and desist orders. When the village finds that any person has violated, or continue to violate, any provision of this division, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that the person's violations(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the village may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this subsection shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the village may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The village may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the village that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this division. A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the village within five (5) business days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator. 
(b)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The village may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the village may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(c)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this division may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The village will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the village for a reconsideration and hearing. 
    A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the village. 
(Ord. No. 2920, § 1, 2-1-10) 
Sec. 8-224. - Civil penalties. 
    In the event the alleged violator fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within five (5) business days, or such greater period as the village shall deem appropriate, after the village has taken one (1) or more of the actions described above, the village may impose a penalty not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) (depending on the severity of the violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(Ord. No. 2920, § 1, 2-1-10) 
Sec. 8-225. - Criminal prosecution. 
    Any person that has violated or continues to violate this division shall be liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest extent of the law, and shall be subject to a criminal penalty of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per violation per day and/or imprisonment for a period of time not to exceed thirty (30) days. Each act of violation and each day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 2920, § 1, 2-1-10) 
Sec. 8-226. - Appeal of notice of violation. 
    Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the village. The notice of appeal must be received within ten (10) business days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the director of public works or his/her designee and shall take place within twenty-eight (28) business days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the municipal authority or their designee shall be final. 
(Ord. No. 2920, § 1, 2-1-10) 
Sec. 8-227. - Enforcement. 
    If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within five (5) business days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the village, then representatives of the village shall enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. 
(Ord. No. 2920, § 1, 2-1-10) 
Sec. 8-228. - Cost of abatement. 
    Within twenty-eight (28) business days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within ten (10) business days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. 
    Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall become liable to the village by reason of such violation. The liability shall be paid in not more than twelve (12) equal payments. Interest at the rate of five (5) percent per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the 30th day following discovery of the violation. 
(Ord. No. 2920, § 1, 2-1-10) 
Sec. 8-229. - Public nuisance. 
    In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this division is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise, compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken. 
(Ord. No. 2920, § 1, 2-1-10) 
Sec. 8-230. - Remedies not exclusive. 
    The remedies listed in this division are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the discretion of the village to seek cumulative remedies.

ARTICLE I. - INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS 

Sec. 9-1. - Short title. 
    This comprehensive amendment shall be known, cited, and referred to as "the Village of Plainfield Zoning Ordinance." Throughout this document it is referred to as the "zoning ordinance." 
Sec. 9-2. - Authority. 
    This zoning ordinance is adopted pursuant to the powers granted and the limitations imposed by state law. 
Sec. 9-3. - Applicability. 
    Unless otherwise expressly exempted, the zoning ordinance applies to all land use, structures, buildings, and development within the village's corporate boundaries and extending beyond the corporate limits as allowed by state law. 
Sec. 9-4. - Purpose and intent. 
    This zoning ordinance is adopted for the purposes of: 
(1)  Protecting and promoting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the village residents; 
(2)  Ensuring adequate light, air, open space, privacy, and access to property; 
(3)  Maintaining and promoting orderly land use patterns; 
(4)  Facilitating the provision of adequate public services such as water, sewage, and utilities; 
(5)  Protecting the quality of life of village residents; 
(6)  Protecting the character of existing residential neighborhoods; 
(7)  Implementing the village's policies and goals, to include those of the comprehensive plan. 
Sec. 9-5. - Separability. 
    If any word, clause, phrase, sentence, paragraph, provision, or application of the zoning ordinance, is, for any reason, judged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, then such judgment will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining word, clause, phrase, sentence, paragraph, provision or application of the zoning ordinance. 
Sec. 9-6. - Interpretation. 
(1)  Conflicting regulations. 
a.  Conflict with federal or state regulations. If a provision of this ordinance is inconsistent with the provision of a federal or state law, the provision that imposes more restrictions or greater control on development shall apply, to the extent permitted by law. 
b.  Conflict with other village regulations. If a provision of this ordinance is inconsistent with another provision in this zoning ordinance, or is inconsistent with another municipal code provision, the provision that imposes more restrictions or greater control on development shall apply. 
c.  Conflict with private agreements or easements. The zoning ordinance is not intended to abrogate, interfere or annul any covenant, easement, deed restriction, or agreement between private parties. If the provisions of this ordinance impose more restrictions or greater control on development, the provisions of this ordinance shall apply. The village does not enforce private agreements. 
d.  Conflict between text, tables and figures. This zoning ordinance contains tables and figures. In some cases the tables and figures are used in lieu of text; in other cases the tables and figures are meant to supplement or clarify the meaning of the text. In cases where there is a conflict between the text of this zoning ordinance and a table or figure of this zoning ordinance, the provisions as expressed in the text shall apply. 
(2)  Minimum requirements. The provisions of the zoning ordinance are deemed to be the minimum requirements necessary to fulfill the ordinance's stated purposes. 
(3)  Meaning and intent. 
a.  Words used in the singular include the plural. The reverse is also true. 
b.  Words used in the present tense shall include the future. 
c.  The word "lot" shall include the words "piece," "parcel" and "plot." 
d.  The phrase "used for" shall include the phrases "maintained for" and "occupied for." 
e.  The following words indicate compliance is mandatory: must, shall, will, may not. 
f.  The following words indicate compliance is permissible or advisory in nature, and not required: may, should. 
g.  Within a series of provisions, the word "and" indicates that all such provisions apply. With a series of provisions the word "or" indicates that both a single provision and a combination of provisions may apply. 
h.  Unless otherwise expressly stated, a list or series of examples that uses "including," "such as," or similar wording shall not be construed as exhaustive. Words highlighted in italics are specifically defined in this ordinance. 
(4)  Fractions. When a regulation is expressed in terms of a minimum requirement, any fractional result of a calculation will be rounded up to the nearest whole number. For example, a minimum requirement of one (1) parking space per three hundred (300) square feet of office space is required, and there is ten thousand (10,000) square feet of office space. The resulting fraction of 33.3 would be rounded up, and thirty-four (34) parking spaces would be required. 
    All references to other regulations are for informational purposes only, and do not necessarily constitute a complete list of applicable rules and regulations. Interested parties remain responsible for ensuring knowledge of and compliance with any and all applicable rules and regulations. 
Sec. 9-7. - References to other regulations. 
    The village may, from time to time, establish submittal requirements, review procedures and design guidelines to supplement this zoning ordinance. All such submittal requirements, procedures, and guidelines shall be approved by the village board and made available for distribution, purchase, or public inspection in the office of the community development department at the Village Hall. Where practical, such materials will also be made available on the village web site. 
Sec. 9-8. - Guidelines. 
    The village has adopted specific residential guidelines that are applicable to all new residential planned developments and annexations. Refer to Residential Design & Planning Guidelines for Planned Developments and Annexations. 
Sec. 9-9. - Effective date and transition. 
(1)  Effective date. Unless otherwise expressly indicated, the provisions of the zoning ordinance become effective on August 15, 2006. 
(2)  Applications submitted before effective date. Complete applications for development that were submitted and pending approval before August 15, 2006 will be reviewed under the terms and provisions of the zoning ordinance that was in effect on the date that the complete application was submitted. Any re-application for an expired permit must meet the standards of the zoning ordinance in effect at the time of the re-application. 
(3)  Permits issued before effective date. If a building or development was issued a building permit prior to the effective date of this zoning ordinance, the building or development may be completed in compliance with that permit and other applicable permits, even if they conflict with provisions of this zoning ordinance. However, if construction is not commenced and diligently pursued within the constraints of the building permit then the building or development must be completed in compliance with the provisions of this zoning ordinance.

Sec. 9-18. - Agriculture as a permitted use. 
    The cultivation of crops shall be permitted in any zoning district. 
Sec. 9-19. - Home occupations. 
    Generally, a home occupation is an incidental and accessory use to a residential use. The standards for home occupations are intended to ensure compatibility with other permitted uses and maintain the residential character of the surrounding residential uses. 
(1)  Location. A home occupation may be conducted in any dwelling unit or in any building or structure accessory to the dwelling unit in any zoning district in which dwelling units are permitted. The building in which the home occupation is located shall be subject to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
(2)  Operation. 
a.  Home occupations shall be conducted only by residents of the subject property. 
b.  The home occupation shall be conducted completely within the dwelling unit or accessory building.

f.  Undertaking establishments and funeral parlors; 
g.  Repair or maintenance of motor vehicles, to include trucks and motorcycles. 
(6)  Permitted home occupations. The zoning ordinance does not attempt to define or list all permitted home occupations. However, the following activities and uses are expressly permitted, provided that the other provisions of this section are met:

b.  Animal grooming services; 
c.  Baby-sitting services and day care activities that do not meet state law thresholds for licensing and regulation;

Sec. 9-20. - Bed and breakfasts. 
    In furtherance of the public policies that support the village as a tourist destination and support the growth of commerce in the village, bed and breakfast establishments are allowed to operate as a special use in single-family detached dwelling units in any R district, providing the provisions of this section are met. 
(1)  Criteria: 
a.  The dwelling unit in which the bed and breakfast operation takes place shall be the principal residence of the operator/owner.

c.  The building shall remain a single-family residential structure. Bed and breakfast establishments shall not be permitted in multi-family or two-family structures. 
d.  The bed and breakfast establishment shall provide at least two (2) exits to the outdoors, and every guest room shall have at least one unobstructed means of egress that leads to a public street or alley, either directly or through a court or yard. Passage to exits shall not lead through any other bedroom or guest room or through a space that can be locked by anyone who is not a member of the family. 
e.  Rooms used for sleeping shall be at least one hundred (100) square feet. 
f.  Each room used for guest sleeping shall be equipped with a smoke detector alarm. The alarm shall be a direct-wired type with battery back up. 
g.  Lavatories and bathing facilities shall be available to all persons using the bed and breakfast. Access to a bathroom shall not require passage through another bedroom. 
h.  Cooking facilities in the guest rooms are prohibited. 
i.  Bed and breakfasts shall not offer restaurant or meal service to the general public. 
j.  The village building official or the Plainfield Fire Protection District may require other safety devices or modifications deemed necessary to protect and preserve public health, safety and welfare.

l.  Two parking spaces plus one additional parking space per guest room shall be provided. All parking spaces shall be paved, and shall be located between the principal structure and the rear lot line. Guest parking areas in excess of four spaces shall be screened from adjacent residences with landscaping or fencing. 
m.  The operator shall keep a list of the names of all persons staying at the bed and breakfast. This list shall be available for inspection by village officials at any time. 
(2)  Applications, fees, and licensing. It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a bed and breakfast without a license. A fee for issuance and renewal of a license shall be collected by the village clerk. The village board shall establish the amount of the fee. It shall be paid semi-annually on or before February 15 and August 15 of each year. To obtain or renew a license, applicants shall submit to the village planner the following: 
a.  A site plan indicating parking location and paving material. For a license renewal, a site plan is required only if the number of parking stalls, location of parking stalls, or paving material has changed. 
b.  A floor plan indicating guest room sizes, bathroom location(s), and exits. For a license renewal, no floor plan is required unless there have been changes to guest room size, bathroom location(s), or exits. 
c.  All requirements for a special use. (See section 9-37). These may not be required upon renewal. 
d.  Proof of liability insurance. This is required upon initial application and renewal. 
e.  Written notice to contiguous property owners. 
(3)  Inspections. The village building official shall conduct a semi-annual inspection of bed and breakfast sites prior to the issuance or renewal of a license to determine compliance with the provisions of this section. 
(4)  Revocation of license. The village board may, at its discretion, revoke a license for a bed and breakfast for repeated nuisances, failure to maintain the premises in a clean, safe, and orderly manner, or for lack of compliance with any of the provisions of the zoning ordinance. 
Sec. 9-21. - Group homes. 
    The special needs and requirements of group homes should be accommodated while minimizing the impact on the surrounding residential area and the community as a whole. Therefore, the following criteria apply: 
(1)  The scale and character of the building shall be compatible with the surrounding residential properties; and 
(2)  The facility shall be certified and licensed by all required federal, state, and local authorities; and 
(3)  No new facility shall be located any closer than one thousand (1,000) feet from another existing group home. 
Sec. 9-22. - Adult uses. 
    Based on experiences and studies prepared by numerous municipalities and the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, Attorney General, State of Minnesota, 1989, the village has determined that adult use establishments-and particularly concentrations of adult uses-have an adverse impact on property values, crime, and neighborhood quality. In a desire to minimize these secondary effects and protect neighborhood quality, the village finds it necessary to regulate such uses while maintaining reasonably available alternatives for their location within the village. Therefore, the location and operation of adult uses shall be limited as follows: 
(1)  Location restrictions. Adult uses listed shall be permitted within the I-2 General Industrial District, provided that the establishment is not located within seven hundred fifty (750) feet of an existing: 
a.  Boundary of any residential district as defined by the zoning ordinance; and 
b.  Place of public gathering or public offices; or 
c.  Public or private educational facility; or 
d.  Park or recreation facility; or 
e.  Religious use or religious institution; or 
f.  Licensed day care facility; 
g.  Adult use; or 
h.  Cemetery. 
(2)  Method of measurement. Measurement of the seven hundred fifty (750) feet limitation shall be made in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the nearest lot line of the lot where the adult use is to be located, to the nearest lot line of the other specified use. 
(3)  Exterior display. No adult use shall be conducted in any manner that permits the observation of any material depicting, describing or relating to special sexual activities or specified anatomical areas from any public or from any other property. This provision shall apply to any display, sign, window or other opening. All entries, windows or other openings for adult uses shall be covered, or screened in a manner that prevents a view into the interior from any public way. 
Sec. 9-23. - Model homes. 
    Model homes shall be used primarily to offer for sale or rental dwelling units located within the same subdivision or planned development in which the model home is located. The following provisions shall govern their operation: 
(1)  Upon request by the village, the owners of the property shall provide information relating to the use of the model home, including, but not necessarily limited to, a record of sales or rentals made from the model home. If no sales or rental activities have occurred in a one-year period, the village may terminate the property's model home status. 
(2)  Building materials may be stored within the garage of the model home, provided that the appearance of the model home is not substantially different from that of the other dwelling units in the subdivision or planned development. 
(3)  Sales offices, rental offices and construction offices may be located in a model home, provided that the appearance of the model home is not substantially different from that of the other dwelling units in the subdivision or planned development. 
(4)  A temporary off-street parking lot is permitted. 
(5)  The model home may be illuminated, provided that the illumination does not adversely affect traffic and surrounding residents. 
(6)  Signage may be provided in accordance with the provisions for "temporary subdivision project signs" found in section 9-99 (Commercial Signs for Residential Uses) of this ordinance. 
Sec. 9-24. - Manufactured homes. 
(1)  Intent. The intent of these provisions is to provide affordable and diversified housing opportunities within the village while maintaining established standards. The provisions are designed to ensure the compatibility of manufactured homes with the on-site built homes in residential districts. The provisions do not apply to "mobile homes" as defined by this zoning ordinance. The erection or siting of mobile homes is prohibited. 
Commentary: The ordinance makes a distinction between "manufactured homes," which may be allowed, and "mobile homes," which are not allowed. Since, as defined by this Ordinance, mobile home means a dwelling, this prohibition against mobile homes would not apply to trailers or similar structures with limited use and temporary in nature, e.g., a trailer on a construction site. 
(2)  Requirements for manufactured homes. Individual manufactured homes may be permitted on individual lots in all residential districts, provided that the manufactured homes: 
a.  Have a permanent foundation in compliance with all applicable building regulations of the village; and 
b.  Have siding material of a type customarily used for on site-constructed housing, with a minimum 6:12 roof pitch; and 
c.  Have roofing materials of a type customarily used on site-constructed housing; and 
d.  Have a shape and form, including the shape and form of the roof, compatible with the housing in the surrounding neighborhood; and 
e.  Conform to all other applicable village codes and standards of this zoning ordinance, to include bulk and density regulations. 
Sec. 9-25. - Interpretation by the village planner. 
(1)  Authority. Where there is ambiguity or dispute concerning the interpretation of this zoning ordinance, the decision of the village planner shall prevail. Where a land use is not listed among the names and categories contained in Table II.1 (Permitted and Special Uses in All Zoning Districts), the village planner may determine that such a land use is allowable in a particular zoning district, provided that the unlisted use is deemed to be similar in nature and clearly compatible with the listed permitted uses for that particular district. 
(2)  Appeal. Interpretations of the village planner are subject to appeal in accordance with the provisions of section 9-35 of this zoning ordinance.

Sec. 9-33. - Variances. 
(1)  Intent and purpose. A variance is a grant of relief to a property owner from the literal requirements of the zoning ordinance where literal enforcement would cause undue hardship. Additionally, a variance is intended to provide relief where the requirements of this Ordinance render the land difficult to use because of some unique physical attribute of the property itself or some other factor unique to the property for which the variance is requested. A variance is not intended merely to remove an inconvenience or financial burden that the requirements of this Ordinance may impose on a property owner. A variance is not intended to allow the establishment of a use that is not otherwise allowed in a zoning district or that would change the zoning district classification of any or all of the affected property, and should not be granted where a special use permit or an amendment to the official zoning map would be more appropriate. 
(2)  Initiation of a variance. A request for a variance may be initiated by either: 
a.  The owner of the subject property; or 
b.  A contract purchaser of the subject property. 
(3)  Application for variance. An application for a variance shall be filed in writing with the zoning administrator and shall include a map of the property showing its dimensions, all streets and alleys, and other properties within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the property. The zoning administrator shall transmit the application to the zoning board of appeals for review and public hearing. The zoning board of appeals shall hold a public hearing within sixty (60) days after filing of the application. 

Figure III-1. Variance Approval Procedure 
(4)  Notice and conduct of the public hearing. The notice for and conduct of the public hearing shall be in accordance with section 9-38 of this zoning ordinance. 
(5)  Findings and recommendations. The zoning board of appeals shall make findings of fact based on evidence presented to it and forward the findings with recommendations to the village board within ten (10) days of the public hearing. 
(6)  Standards for a variance. The ZBA shall not recommend, and the village board shall not grant, a variance from the regulations of the zoning ordinance unless it makes findings based on evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
a.  The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this zoning ordinance; and 
b.  The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances and thus strict enforcement of the zoning ordinance would result in practical difficulties or impose exceptional hardships due to the special and unusual conditions that are not generally found on other properties in the same zoning district; and 
c.  The property cannot yield a reasonable use if permitted only under the conditions allowed by the zoning ordinance; and 
d.  The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality and will not be a substantial detriment to adjacent property. 
(7)  Burden of proof for variance. In each case of a requested variance, the applicant must satisfy the proof that the proposed variance meets the standards of paragraph (6) of this section, even if there is no testimony or other evidence opposing or rebutting the requested variance. 
(8)  Village board actions on a variance. Within forty-five (45) days of the completed public hearing the village board shall review the findings and recommendations of the zoning board of appeals. The village board may grant, deny, or grant with modification the proposed variance. If the village board grants the variance, it shall make findings of fact specifying the reasons for the variance in accordance with the standards of paragraph (6) of this section. Additionally, if granting the variance, the village board shall adopt an ordinance approving the application. 
Sec. 9-34. - Administrative adjustments. 
(1)  Authority. The zoning administrator is authorized to make administrative adjustments, except as expressly prohibited in paragraph (4) of this section, providing that in each case the criteria of paragraph (2) of this section are met, as follows: 
a.  Maximum building height-Up to five (5) percent over the maximum; and 
b.  Minimum setbacks-Up to five (5) percent of the minimum; and 
c.  After-the-fact encroachments into yards-Up to six (6) inches. 
(2)  Criteria. The zoning administrator shall not authorize an administrative adjustment unless the following criteria are satisfied: 
a.  The requested administrative adjustment is consistent with the stated intent and purposes of the zoning ordinance (see section 9-4); and 
b.  The requested administrative adjustment eliminates an inconvenience to the applicant and will have no appreciable adverse impact on the health, safety, or general welfare of the surrounding property owners or general public; and 
c.  Any adverse impacts resulting from the administrative adjustment will be mitigated to the maximum extent feasible. 
(3)  Procedure. The property owner, or agent, shall submit to the zoning administrator the following: 
a.  A map or elevation, as appropriate, depicting the difference between the zoning ordinance's standard and the requested adjustment; 
b.  A statement on why the adjustment is necessary and why, if granted, it would meet the criteria of paragraph (2) of this section. 
(4)  Prohibited adjustments. The zoning administrator shall not make an administrative adjust for a planned development or special use. (See section 9-50 for administrative adjustments to planned developments.) 
Sec. 9-35. - Appeals. 
(1)  Right to appeal. An appeal may be made by any person, firm, or corporation, or by any officer, department or board of the municipality aggrieved by the action of the zoning administrator. 
(2)  Procedure for appeals. An appeal may be taken from any order, requirement, decision or determination of the zoning administrator. The appeal shall be made within forty-five (45) days of the action by filing with the zoning administrator and with the board of appeals a notice of appeal. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the zoning administrator must forward to the zoning board of appeals all papers which constitute a record of the action that is being appealed. 

Figure III-2. Appeal Approval Procedure 
(3)  Effect of the appeal. A filing of a complete notice of appeal stays all further proceedings unless the zoning administrator certifies to the ZBA, after the appeal is filed, based on the facts stated in the certification/affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In this event, the stay may be effectuated only by an order of the zoning board of appeals or by a court of record. 
(4)  Public hearing. No more than thirty (30) days after the filing of a complete notice of appeal, the zoning board of appeals shall hold a hearing to consider the appeal. The notice for and conduct of the public hearing shall be in accordance with section 9-38 of this zoning ordinance. 
(5)  Decision of the village board. The zoning board of appeals shall transmit to the village board its written findings and recommendations of the appeal within a reasonable time, but in no event more than sixty (60) days after the filing of the notice of appeal, and shall promptly forward a copy of the decision to the parties concerned. The village board may affirm or may reverse, in whole or in part, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination of the zoning administrator. 
Sec. 9-36. - Amendments. 
(1)  Authority. The village board, after receiving findings and recommendations from the plan commission, may amend the regulations of this ordinance or amend the boundaries of the official zoning map. 
(2)  Initiation of amendments. Text amendments may be initiated by the mayor, village board, plan commission, or zoning administrator. Official zoning map amendments may be initiated by the village board, plan commission, zoning administrator, owner of the property, or contract purchaser of the property. 
(3)  Application for map amendment. An application for an amendment of the official zoning map shall be filed in writing with the zoning administrator and shall include a map of the property showing its dimensions, all streets and alleys, and other properties within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the property. The zoning administrator shall transmit the application to the plan commission or zoning board of appeals, as appropriate, for review and public hearing. The plan commission shall hold a public hearing within 60 days after filing of the complete application. 
(4)  Notice and conduct of public hearing. Notice for and conduct of the public hearing shall be in accordance with section 9-38 of this zoning ordinance. 
(5)  Official zoning map amendments (rezonings). The plan commission shall not recommend nor shall the village board grant an amendment altering the zoning district boundary lines unless it shall find, based on the evidence presented to it in each specific case, that: 
a.  The amendment promotes the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare, and complies with the policies and official plans of the village; and 
b.  The trend of development in the area of the subject property is consistent with the requested amendment; and 
c.  The requested zoning classification permits uses which are more suitable than the uses permitted under the existing zoning classification; and 
d.  The property cannot yield a reasonable use if permitted only under the conditions allowed under the existing zoning classification; and 
e.  The amendment, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood and will not be a substantial detriment to adjacent property. 
(6)  Decision of the village board. After recommendation by the plan commission, the village board may grant, deny, or grant with the modification, the amendment, or may refer the proposed amendment back to the plan commission for further consideration. If the village board grants the amendment, it shall adopt an ordinance approving the amendment. 
Sec. 9-37. - Special uses. 
(1)  Purpose. The development and execution of this ordinance is based upon the division of the village into zoning districts within which the use of land, and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. However, there are certain uses that, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts, without consideration in each case of the impact of those uses on adjacent properties and of the public need for the particular use in the particular location. Case-by-case review is intended to ensure consideration of the particular special use's anticipated land use, site design, and impacts. 

Figure III-3. Special Use Approval Procedure 
(2)  Initiation of a special use. A special use application may be filed by the owner or contract purchaser of the property. 
(3)  Application for special use. An application for a special use shall be filed in writing with the zoning administrator and shall include a map of the property showing its dimensions, all streets and alleys, and other properties within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the property. Applications for a planned development shall be in accordance with the provisions of Article IV of this zoning ordinance. The zoning administrator shall transmit the application to the plan commission, as appropriate, for review and public hearing. The plan commission or zoning board of appeals, as appropriate, shall hold a public hearing within sixty (60) days after filing of the application. 
(4)  Notice and conduct of public hearing. Notice for and conduct of the public hearing shall be in accordance with section 9-38 of this zoning ordinance. 
(5)  Standards for special uses. The plan commission shall not recommend, nor the village board grant, a special use unless it shall make findings of fact based on the evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
a.  The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate area for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish property values with the neighborhood; and 
b.  The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the adjacent properties for uses permitted in the subject zoning district. 
(6)  Burden of proof for special use. In each case of a requested special use, the applicant must satisfy the proof that the proposed special use meets the standards of sub-paragraph (5) of this section, even if there is no testimony or other evidence opposing or rebutting the requested special use. 
(7)  Decision of the village board. After recommendation by the plan commission, the village board may grant, deny, or grant with modification the special use, or may refer the proposed special use back to the plan commission for further consideration. If the village board grants a special use, it shall adopt an ordinance authorizing the special use. 
(8)  Conditions and restrictions. When the special use is determined to have the potential for adverse impacts, the plan commission may recommend and the village board may impose conditions on the approval to ensure that the adverse impacts will be mitigated. Such conditions may include impositions on the site planning, design, location, and operation of the special use. 
(9)  Lapse of approval and discontinuance. An ordinance approving a special use is valid for twelve (12) months from the date of the ordinance unless a building permit is obtained or the use is commenced. If a building permit is not obtained or the use is not commenced within such time, the approval for special use will lapse and shall become null and void. If a special use is discontinued for a period of six (6) months or longer, the special use shall be considered abandoned and shall become null and void. Reinstatement or re-establishment of the special use will require approval pursuant to the provisions of this section. The provisions of this paragraph (9) do not apply to planned developments. 
(10)  Amendments to special use. A change in the area, bulk, size, use or intensity of use of an existing special use, or a change to the conditions specified for a special use at the time of approval, shall be deemed the same as a new special use and shall require approval pursuant to the provisions of this section. 
Sec. 9-38. - Public hearings-Notice and conduct. 
(1)  Conduct of public hearing . Public hearings shall be conducted by the plan commission, zoning board of appeals, or historic preservation commission, as appropriate, and a record of such proceedings shall be preserved in such a manner as the appropriate body, by rule, may prescribe from time to time.

Any person who violates, disobeys, neglects, omits, refuses to comply with, or resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this zoning ordinance shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each offense. Each day that a violation continues to exist shall constitute a separate offense. 
Sec. 9-41. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IV. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS 

Sec. 9-42. - Purpose. 
(1)  General. The Planned Development (PD) approach provides the flexibility needed to promote innovative and creative land development that achieves the community vision outlined in the comprehensive plan. Within the framework of a PD normal zoning standards may be modified. The resulting flexibility is intended to encourage developments that are more environmentally sensitive, economically viable, and aesthetically pleasing than might otherwise be possible if the standards of the underlying zoning district(s) were strictly enforced. A PD is intended to remain in substantial compliance with the densities outlined in the comprehensive plan. Increased densities from the underlying zoning may be permitted under this section if such increases can be substantiated based on a superior site design following the village's design guidelines. Each proposal for a PD shall be presented and judged on its own merits, and approval shall not be based exclusively on a comparison to an already existing PD. 
(2)  Objectives. Specifically, the objectives of a PD are: 
a.  To stimulate creative approaches to the residential, commercial, and industrial development of land; and 
b.  To provide more efficient use of land; and 
c.  To preserve or enhance natural features and provide open space areas. 
Sec. 9-43. - Applicability. 
(1)  Elective. Any owner of property who wishes to develop his or her property as a PD may voluntarily petition such approval under the provisions of this ordinance. 
(2)  Mandatory. 
a.  Development of land that includes more than one type of land use on a single zoning lot shall proceed as a PD. 
b.  The village administrator or community development director shall have the right to require all development of land which meets or exceeds one or more of the following thresholds to be developed as a PD: 
i.  Development of land totaling twenty (20) or more acres; or 
ii.  Development of land including fifty (50) or more dwelling units. 
Sec. 9-44. - Development standards. 
    In recommending approval or granting approval of preliminary development plans and final development plans, the plan commission and the village board shall ensure that the proposed PD meets the following standards: 
(1)  Ownership. The land intended for the PD shall be under single ownership and/or unified control. 
(2)  Compatibility. The proposed use or combination of uses is consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan. 
(3)  Accessibility. Adequate utilities, road access, draining, police and fire service and other necessary facilities already exist or will be provided to serve the proposed PD. 
(4)  Designation of land for schools, recreational amenities and permanent common open space. The proposed PD shall provide for the dedication of land for school sites and land for recreational purposes. Alternatively, the village board may approve a cash payment in lieu of actual land dedication, or may approve a combination of cash and land dedication. 
a.  Common open space. Common open space shall be provided for recreational purposes. Such open space may be designed for active or passive recreational use. Common open space shall meet the following standards: 
i.  Each parcel of common open space intended for active recreation shall be at least twelve thousand (12,000) square feet. The minimum width of the common open space shall allow for the safe participation in the active recreational activities for which it is designed. For trail purposes the minimum open space width shall be twenty (20) feet. 
ii.  Each parcel must be accessible to all the residents of the proposed PD. Sidewalks, bike trails or pedestrian trails must link the parcels. 
iii.  The slope must be appropriate for the activities for which the common open space is intended. 
iv.  Land dedicated to the village or Park District may be included in the calculation of usable common open space. 
b.  Areas excluded from common open space. Common open space shall not include: 
i.  Areas reserved for the exclusive use or benefit of an individual tenant or owner; 
ii.  Dedicated streets, alleys, and other public rights-of-way; 
iii.  Required detention areas, floodplains or wetlands, unless the village board determines that natural features, such as a creek or lake, will be a substantial amenity for the development; 
iv.  Irregular or unusable narrow strips of land less than fifty (50) feet wide, unless containing a trail or bicycle path; 
v.  Existing permanent utility easements. 
(5)  Open space ownership and maintenance. 
a.  Public or private ownership. The public or private ownership and maintenance responsibilities for all common open spaces shall be established by the developer and approved as part of the ordinance authorizing the PD. All common areas should be platted as separate outlots. Restrictive covenants running with the land shall guarantee that the common open space will be properly cared for and used only for purposes designated in the PD's approved final development plan. 
b.  Maintenance. To ensure appropriate long-term maintenance of private common open space the developer shall submit a detailed open space management plan describing the method and schedule of maintenance. 
(6)  Limits on use. No common open space may be put to any use not specified in the final development plan unless the final development plan has been amended according to section 9-50 of this ordinance. 
(7)  Special service area. A special service area shall be required to ensure adequate property maintenance. This special service area shall be created at the time of final platting of the first phase of the PD, and shall include all phases of the Planned Development. In the event the entity that has ownership and maintenance responsibilities fails to adequately manage the open space, the village may assume maintenance responsibilities until such time as that or another appropriate entity can manage the open space. The village may tax the property of those within the special service area for the village's prior and estimated future cost of maintaining the open space. 
(8)  Completion of recreational facilities and other site amenities. 
a.  Commencement of construction. Construction of recreational facilities and other improvements to common open spaces serving a PD shall commence in accordance with the approved PD ordinance. At a minimum, such improvements shall commence prior to the completion of not more than thirty-three (33) percent of the dwelling units in the development or prior to the completion of the first seventy-five (75) dwelling units, whichever comes first. 
b.  Completion of construction. Recreation facilities and other improvements to common open spaces shall be completed prior to the issuance of building permits for the last twenty-five (25) percent of the dwelling units, or twenty-five (25) percent of the total gross floor area of commercial and industrial uses within a PD developed as a single phase. 
c.  Phased developments. In PDs containing two (2) or more phases, construction of recreation facilities in earlier phases shall be completed prior to the issuance of occupancy permits for the next phase of the PD. 
(9)  Site design. PDs shall adhere to the site design provisions contained in Article XIII (Site Design) of this zoning ordinance. 
(10)  Commercial development. Commercial development within a PD should be focused on the provision of goods and services to community residents. To further this goal, a maximum of thirty (30) percent of the building square footage within a commercial PD should be comprised of non-retail uses. 
(11)  Additional conditions. To meet the unique circumstances presented by each PD, and to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of existing village residents and the residents of the proposed development, the village board reserves the right to attach any other conditions it deems necessary, but not specifically provided in this ordinance, to the approval of the PDs. Such additional conditions may include, but are not limited to, more stringent requirements for construction, phasing, and revocation. 
Sec. 9-45. - Permitted variations from village ordinances. 
(1)  General. Except as specifically provided otherwise in this section, planned developments shall be developed in conformity with this zoning ordinance and all other applicable codes and ordinances of the village. Modifications that deviate from the bulk, density, and design provisions in this zoning ordinance and in other applicable regulations are privileges and will be considered by the village only in direct response to the tangible community benefits received from the PD. These benefits shall be in the form of: exceptional amenities; outstanding environmental, landscape, architectural or site design; or the conservation of special man-made or natural features of the site. The village's Design Guidelines shall be used in the evaluation of these benefits. 
(2)  Bulk regulations. PDs are governed by the bulk regulations of the underlying zoning district. However, the plan commission may recommend, and village board may authorize, exceptions to the applicable bulk regulations of this ordinance within the boundaries of such planned development including building height, lot area, lot width, and yard setback requirements, provided that: 
a.  Such exceptions shall be solely for the purpose of promoting an efficient and coordinated site plan, no less beneficial to the residents or occupants of such development, as well as the neighboring property, than would be obtained under the bulk regulations of this ordinance for buildings developed on separate zoning lots; and 
b.  Along the periphery of such PDs, yards or setbacks shall be provided that meet or exceed the regulations of the district in which the PD is located. 
(3)  Land uses. The plan commission may recommend, and village board may authorize, that there be permitted in part of the area of a proposed PD, and for the duration of such development, specified uses not permitted by the use regulations of the district in which the development is proposed. Proposed PDs with mixed land uses shall not be recommended or approved unless: 
a.  The proposed land uses are necessary or desirable and are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the PD; and 
b.  The proposed uses are not of such a nature or so located as to exercise a detrimental influence on the surrounding neighborhood. 
(4)  Other. See section 9-49 of this ordinance for additional required findings. 
Sec. 9-46. - Guidelines for planned developments. 
    In accordance with the provisions of section 9-8, the village may publish design guidelines for PDs. In reviewing the preliminary and final development plans the plan commission and village board should consider the application as a whole; the deviation from one or more guidelines should not necessarily preclude approval of the plans. Nevertheless, before granting approval of preliminary development plans and final development plans pursuant to this article, the plan commission and the village board should encourage compliance with any and all published guidelines. All residential planned developments shall meet the minimum architectural requirements outlined in section 9-54 in addition to any approved project specific requirements of the PD. 
Sec. 9-47. - Approval procedures for planned developments. 
    A PD shall be granted as a special use to the zoning district in which it is located. The village board is the final decision-making body. The process for obtaining a PD approval shall be as follows: 
(1)  Pre-application meeting and concept plan. 
a.  Purpose. Prior to filing a formal application for approval of a PD, the applicant shall request a meeting with the village planner or, with village board consent a PD Review Committee, in order to present a concept plan of the proposed PD. The nature of this meeting is advisory only. Nothing offered or said by the village planner, village staff, village representatives, or village consultants shall be construed as an approval of the project or approval of any particular element of the project. All advice and recommendations are subject to modification during later stages of the approval procedure as outlined in this section, and the petitioner remains responsible for ensuring that all applicable village ordinances and standards are met. The purpose of the pre-application meeting is to help the applicant determine whether: 
i.  The concept plan appears to be in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance and all other applicable village standards and ordinances. 
ii.  Any zoning amendment or variation is required in connection with the proposed development. 
iii.  The concept plan appears to be in conformity with the land-use policies and objectives of the village as expressed in the village comprehensive plan and this zoning ordinance. 

Figure IV-1. PD Approval Process 
b.  Participation. At a minimum, the village planner or his/her representative shall participate in the pre-application meeting. The village administrator, with village board consent, may establish a PD Review Committee for the purposes of participating in the pre-application meeting, and the petitioner or the village administrator may request that this committee review the application. Such a PD Review Committee, if established, shall consist of: the village planner or his/her representative; at least one member of the plan commission; at least one member of the village board. The village administrator may name additional members to the PD Review Committee. These additional members may include, but are not limited to: village staff, village consultants, members of the Plainfield Economic Partnership, and additional members of the plan commission or village board. 
c.  Concept plan. For the pre-application meeting with either the village planner or the PD Review Committee the petitioner should: 
i.  Prepare documents describing the nature of the proposed development and the relationship of the proposed PD to adjoining uses, both existing and planned, and to the topography and natural features of the site and adjoining lands. 
ii.  Prepare other documents as recommended by the village planner. The village planner may prepare, publish, and distribute a list of documents and information recommended for the pre-application meeting. This list may include, but is not limited to, such items as street and lot layouts, parking, current site vegetation, and preliminary engineering studies. 
iii.  Forward the recommended documents to the village planner. Such documents should be received by the village planner at least two (2) days prior to the scheduled pre-application meeting. 
d.  Review. The village planner or his/her representative and, if requested, the PD Review Committee, shall review the submitted documents and advise the applicant as to the compatibility of the proposed development with the comprehensive plan and this zoning ordinance. The recommendations relative to the pre-application review are advisory only, and shall not constitute a waiver from requirements contained in village ordinances. 
e.  Additional meetings. The village planner, or, if established, the PD Review Committee, may request, but not require, additional pre-application meetings with the applicant. The intent of such additional meetings should be to ensure that the proposed PD conforms, to the maximum extent possible, with the applicable code provisions, goals and policies of the village. 
f.  Report. The village staff, PD Review Committee, or consultants may prepare a written summary report of any pre-application meeting and forward the report to the plan commission and village board. 
(2)  Preliminary development plan. 
a.  Purpose. The purpose of the preliminary development plan is to obtain a recommendation from the plan commission and preliminary approval by the village board that the applicant's intended development of land is acceptable and that the applicant can reasonably proceed with preparation of detailed architecture, engineering, and site and landscape plans.

f.  Village board actions. The village board shall review the plan commission's findings of fact and recommendations, and following such review may approve, deny, or approve with modification the final development plan of the proposed PD. 

Figure IV-3. PD Final Development Plan Approval Process 
(3)  Status of preliminary development plan. 
a.  Approval of a preliminary development plan shall not constitute approval of the final plan, nor qualify a plat of the PD for recording. Rather it shall be deemed an expression of approval of the preliminary plan as a guide for preparation of the final plan. Furthermore, the approval of the preliminary development plan shall vest no rights to the applicants other than to be able to submit a final development plan. 
b.  A preliminary development plan which has been granted approval as submitted, or approval with conditions or modifications, shall not be modified, revoked or otherwise impaired by action of the village, pending an application for final approval, without the consent of the applicants, provided that application for final approval is filed within any time or times that may be specified in the resolution granting preliminary approval. 
(4)  Final development plan. 
a.  Purpose. The purpose of the final plan is to provide a detailed design for the land to be subdivided, as well as the division of other lands into common open spaces and building areas, and to more specifically address land uses and building locations, engineering, and architectural design. 
b.  Submission. The application for approval of the final development plan of a PD may be submitted in phases. An application for approval of the final development plan or for a phase of the final development plan shall be filed with the village planner.

ARTICLE V. - RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 

Sec. 9-51. - General. 
    The residential districts ("R districts") are primarily for residential land uses and for other selected uses that are deemed compatible with residential environments. The various residential districts are intended to maintain and promote a variety of housing types within the village. 
Sec. 9-52. - Purposes of the R districts. 
(1)  R-E Residential District. This district is intended to provide areas for relatively large single-family detached homes on lot sizes of approximately one acre. Because of the intended estate character of the housing, non-residential and non-recreational land uses are not permitted as of right in this district. This zoning district corresponds to the Countryside Residential land use category in the village's Comprehensive Plan. Residential density is intended to be approximately 0-1 dwelling units per acre. 
(2)  R-1 Low Density Single-Family Residential District. This district is intended to provide areas for low density, single-family detached housing on lot sizes with a minimum of twelve thousand (12,000) square feet. Compatible government, religious, educational, and recreational uses may be permitted within the district. This zoning district corresponds, approximately, to the Low Density Residential land use category in the village's Comprehensive Plan. Residential density is intended to be a maximum of 2.1 dwelling units per acre if a part of a PD. 
(3)  R-1 Overlay District. This overlay district is established to address the unique issues within the residential areas of the village's historic core area. This area is illustrated on Map X-1 on page 90. 
(4)  R-2 Single-Family and Two-Family Residential District. This district is intended to provide areas for a mix of single-family detached housing and two-family attached housing on lot sizes with a minimum of twelve thousand (12,000) square feet. A limit of two (2) dwelling units per lot shall be maintained. Compatible government, religious, education, and recreational land uses may be permitted within the district. This zoning district corresponds, approximately, to the Medium Density Residential land use category in the village's Comprehensive Plan. Residential density is intended to be a maximum of 3.15 dwelling units per acre as a part of a PD. 
(5)  R-3 Townhouse Residential District. This district is intended to provide areas for a variety of housing types at medium densities. Compatible government, religious, education, and recreational uses may be permitted within the district. This zoning district corresponds to the density, but not necessarily location, of the village Residential land use category in the village's Comprehensive Plan. Residential density is intended to be a maximum of six (6) dwelling unit per acre if a part of a PD. 
(6)  R-4 Multiple-Family Residential District. This district is intended to provide areas for all forms of attached multi-family housing, including duplexes, townhouses, condominiums and apartments. This zoning district corresponds to the Multiple Family Residential land use category in the village's Comprehensive Plan. Residential density is much higher than in the other districts, and is intended to be a maximum of fifteen (15) dwelling unit per acre within a planned development. The maximum height of a building is limited to forty-eight (48) feet. 
(7)  CV Conservation District. This district, with a residential density of approximately 1-3 dwelling units per acre, is intended to foster the creation of clustered residential areas that preserve natural and cultural resources. The goal of this district is to retain the rural character of the site by minimizing the destruction of existing vegetation, maintaining environmental corridors, creating common open space, conserving the natural topography, and designing around, thereby preserving, sites of significant historic, archaeological, or architectural value. See section 9-56 for specific standards and additional goals of the CV district. 
(8)  TN Traditional Neighborhood District. This district is intended to regulate new development with more traditional forms of neighborhood layout. It allows various housing types: single-family, duplex, and townhouse. Residential density is intended to be approximately 5-6 dwelling units per acre. Although it is similar to the R-3 district, it differs from the R-3 in allowing limited commercial uses, permitting alleys and smaller lot dimensions, and it has unique site design standards. One of the overall goals of the TN district is to stimulate non-motorized travel modes such as walking and biking. See section 9-55 for specific standards for the TN district. This district is not appropriate within the village core area designated as the R-1 Overlay district. 
(9)  HD Historic District. This district is intended to identify the designated historic district(s) as approved by the village board. There may be more than one designated district, but each district will have its own regulations to maintain its individual character as described in section 9-57. 
Sec. 9-53. - Permitted and special uses in the R districts. 
    Uses are allowed in the R districts in accordance with section 9-13 and Table II-1. 
Sec. 9-54. - General standards for the R districts. 
    Specific minimum and maximum standards for lots and buildings in the "R" districts include: 
(1)  Table V.1-Bulk, density and lot coverage standards for R districts. The standards and accompanying notes define such items as lot size and bulk of buildings for all R districts. 
(2)  Table V.2-Minimum setback requirements for R districts. The standards and accompanying notes define the minimum yard requirements for all R districts. 
(3)  Minimal architectural standards. These standards will apply to all homes built within Plainfield. No bonus will be provided for achieving these minimum standards. 
a.  Exterior siding materials shall consist of any of the following: brick, stone, cultured stone, E.I.F.S., stucco, cedar shake or siding, fiber-cement, board or architectural grade vinyl. Non-architectural grade vinyl siding shall not be permitted. 
b.  Single-family homes shall incorporate an eave line on all four (4) facades with a minimum width of six (6) inches. 
c.  All corner and through lot, elevations shall incorporate a minimum amount of architectural articulation that may include at least one of the following architectural elements: masonry wainscot, French patio doors, traditional window fenestration with shutters, masonry chimney chase, bay projections or gables over second floor windows. 
(4)  [Driveways.] 
a.  That the maximum width of a driveway shall be twenty (20) feet at the curb; and 
b.  That all driveways shall maintain a minimum five (5) foot setback from any property line, except, side-loaded garage driveways may encroach within the five (5) foot setback subject to maintaining a minimum of five (5) feet of green space between adjacent driveways. 
(Ord. No. 2615, § V, 2-5-07; Ord. No. 2823, § II, 1-5-09) 
Sec. 9-55. - TN district standards. 
(1)  Intent. The Traditional Neighborhood district is intended to regulate new development consistent with historical building patterns featuring smaller lots, alleys, and grid-like street patterns. Such development would generally be appropriate in areas planned for village Residential Use on the Comprehensive Plan. This zoning category is not appropriate in the existing downtown area. 
(2)  Permitted and special uses. One of the goals of the TN district is to promote the creation of compact neighborhoods where daily destinations-such as a school or grocery store-can be reached with ease on foot. Therefore, the TN district permits a limited range of commercial activities that citizens normally frequent on a daily or weekly basis. Such commercial activities are typically situated on corner locations. 
(3)  Design standards. The TN district has unique design standards. These standards are in addition to any standards or requirements found elsewhere in this ordinance or in other applicable ordinances. In case of any conflict or discrepancy between a standard found in this section of the ordinance and standards found elsewhere in this ordinance or found in the village Subdivision Ordinance, the standard found in this section shall have precedence.

(Ord. No. 2823, § II, 1-5-09) 
Sec. 9-56. - CV district design standards. 
(1)  Intent. The provisions of this section are intended to foster the creation of clustered residential areas that preserve natural and cultural resources. The goal of this district is to retain the rural character of the site by minimizing the destruction of existing vegetation, maintaining environmental corridors, creation common open space, conserving the natural topography, and designing around, thereby preserving, sites of significant historic, archaeological, or architectural value. Specifically, the CV district regulations are intended to: 
a.  Protect and enhance biodiversity; 
b.  Minimize development on and destruction of sensitive natural resource areas and wildlife habitats; 
c.  Reduce the quantity and improve the quality of storm water runoff; 
d.  Provide a wider range of feasible sites for storm water Best Management Practices (BMPs); 
e.  Reduce soil erosion; 
f.  Reduce the capital costs of development; 
g.  Preserve significant cultural resources. 
(2)  Requirements. All of the following shall apply: 
a.  Minimum district size. The minimum size of a CV district shall be forty (40) acres; 
b.  Restrictions on future use. Permanent common open space, not to be further subdivided, and restricted from further subdivision through a direct dedication or through a recorded permanent conservation easement held (at the village's option) by the village or a recognized land trust or conservancy; 
c.  Minimum acreage. A minimum of thirty (30) percent of the total acreage of the development shall be used for common open spaces, and a bonus in the permitted density is offered when at least forty (40) percent of the total acreage is used for common open space (see paragraph five (5) of this section); 
d.  Park dedication. The common open space requirement shall be in addition to any requirements for the dedication of land for public parks. 
e.  Minimum width. The minimum width of any open space shall be fifty (50) feet; 
f.  Division of space. Wherever practical, the open space areas shall generally be designated as contiguous and undivided so as to: 
i.  Facilitate easement monitoring and enforcement; and 
  

Figure V-6. Example of Conservation Design Development 
General Features: 
 Open space is generally contiguous and has not been divided into small chunks. 
 Adequate access points to other subdivisions and roads. 
 Numerous water features throughout site-storm water management practices. 
 Extensive pathway system. 
 All residential lots abut open space. 
_____ 
ii.  Promote appropriate management by a single entity according to approved land management standards; and 
iii.  Provide adequate habitat areas for wildlife and native vegetation. 
g.  Access to open space. Undivided open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practical number of residential lots within the development so that: 
i.  The majority of residential lots abut undivided open space in order to provide direct views and access; and 
ii.  Safe and convenient access to all lots not adjoining the open space shall be provided. 
h.  Paths. A pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that residents can walk safely and easily on the site, between properties and activities or special features within the neighborhood open space system shall be provided. All roadside footpaths should connect with off-road trails, which in turn should link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels (or with existing open space on adjoining developed parcels). 
i.  Culs-de-sac. Culs-de-sac are permitted. The following apply: 
i.  Maximum length shall be one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet; 
ii.  The cul-de-sac shall terminate with a planting island that has a minimum diameter of twenty (20) feet. 
iii.  The planting island shall be landscaped with low ground cover and a minimum of two (2) trees, each with three-inch calipers. Evergreens and/or deciduous plants may be used. 
j.  Drainage. If public sanitary sector is not available the required open space may be used for underground drainage fields for individual or community septic systems, and for "spray fields" or spray irrigation purposes in a "land treatment" sewage disposal system. However, "mound" systems protruding above grade and aerated sewage treatment ponds or "spray fields" shall be limited to no more than ten (10) percent of the required minimum open space. 
k.  Landscaping. Common areas, cul-de-sac islands, and buffer areas shall be landscaped with native specie shade trees and flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value. 
l.  Other. Storm water management ponds or basins may be included as part of the minimum required open space, as may land within the rights-of-way for underground utilities. However, land within the rights-of-way of over-head high tension power lines shall not be included as comprising part of the minimum required open space. 
(3)  Design guidelines. In addition to the requirements in paragraph (2) of this section, the design of the conservation development should, to the greatest extent possible, accomplish the following: 
a.  Protect floodplains, wetlands and steep slopes from clearing, grading, filing or construction; 
b.  Preserve and maintain mature woodlands, meadows and orchards and create sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses; 
c.  Separate development from existing public roads, either by distance, or some form of buffering such as a planting screen primarily consisting of indigenous trees, shrubs and wildflowers and grasses. 
d.  Maintain or create an upland buffer of native species vegetation of approximately fifty (50) feet in depth adjacent to wetlands and surface waters; 
e.  Preserve existing hedgerows and treelines between fields or meadows and minimizes impacts on large woodlands (greater than one acre), especially those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife habitat, or those not degraded by invasive plants; 
f.  The use of swales vegetated with native materials is encouraged as a method of storm water conveyance to decrease runoff velocity, allow for biofiltration, allow suspended sediment particles to settle, and remove pollutants; 
g.  Protect wildlife habitat areas and ravines; 
h.  Leave scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted, particularly as seen from public thoroughfares; 
i.  Avoid siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges, by taking advantage of lower topographical features; 
j.  Design around and preserve sites of historic, archaeological value, or vernacular architecture reminiscent of the area's agricultural heritage; 
k.  Protect roadside rural character and improve public safety and vehicular carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting directly onto existing roads. 
(4)  Ownership and management of open space. For the ownership and management of open space in a conservation development, the provisions of section 9-44 of this ordinance shall apply. 
(5)  Calculation of density. 
a.  For residential development, density generally refers to the number of dwelling units per acre. Residential densities as meant in this section of the ordinance do not refer to the gross area of a site, but to the gross "buildable" area of a site. This approach acknowledges that some portions of a site, such as flood plains and wetlands, are not appropriate for development, and that preservation of these features can also provide amenities to the community. 
b.  Minimum lot size and minimum lot width. Minimum lot size and minimum lot width shall be based upon the amount of common open space, as required in paragraph (2) of this section that is maintained and/or created. 
(6)  Approval for reduced lot dimensions. The approval for the reduced lot dimensions shall follow be the same as the procedures for approval of a planned development as specified in Article IV of this zoning ordinance. 
Sec. 9-57. - Historic district. 
    This district is intended to identify the designated historic district(s) as approved by the village board. Once a district receives a recommendation for designation by the historic preservation commission (HPC), a set of regulations will be established by the HPC to maintain the character of that district for any future renovation, rehabilitation, and new construction projects. The regulations will be included as part of the ordinance that declares the district as historic, subject to board approval. Regulations may include the following: 
 Permitted and special uses; 
 Accessory Buildings and uses of land; 
 Design standards; 
 Bulk, density and lot coverage standards; 
 Setback requirements; 
 Fences; 
 Signs. 
    These new regulations will supersede the bulk zoning regulations for the area defined within the district. All significant changes to the exterior of any building or structures within the designated district must apply for a certificate of appropriateness (COA) or a certificate of economic hardship (COEH) before commencing any renovation, rehabilitation or new construction projects to ensure the proposed work meets the regulations for the district. Refer to article XV for additional information. 
ARTICLE VI. - BUSINESS DISTRICTS 

Sec. 9-58. - General. 
    The business districts ("B districts") are intended primarily for retail, service, and commercial land uses. The various business districts are intended to maintain and promote a variety of commercial activities within the village. 
Sec. 9-59. - Purposes of the B district. 
(1)  B-1 Neighborhood Convenience District. This district is intended to provide convenience shopping for persons living in adjacent residential areas. Permitted uses are those that satisfy basic daily or frequent shopping needs. The district is also intended to promote pedestrian access to shopping and services. This zoning district corresponds, approximately, to the smaller areas planned for general commercial use in the Comprehensive Plan. 
(2)  B-3 Highway Business District. This district is intended to accommodate a broad range of retail, service, and commercial uses, and allows for the highest intensity of such uses. Unlike the other business districts-where pedestrian travel to and from the commercial activity is encouraged-virtually all patrons will arrive by automobile. This zoning district corresponds to larger tracts planned for general commercial land use in the village's Comprehensive Plan. 
(3)  B-5 Traditional Business District. This district is intended to accommodate the retail, service, and office uses and lot configurations that are characteristic of the traditional downtown area of the Village of Plainfield. The environment is intended to be pedestrian-oriented, rather than auto-oriented. This zoning district corresponds to areas planned for both mixed use and general commercial along Lockport Street in the village's Comprehensive Plan. 
(4)  BT Business Transition District. This district is intended to provide opportunities for the preservation of residential structures and neighborhood character while permitting conversion to a limited range of commercial uses in properties located along arterial streets and/or within the downtown. The district is not intended for general office and/or commercial expansion, development, or redevelopment. This zoning district corresponds to the transitional commercial land use category in the village's Comprehensive Plan. 
Sec. 9-60. - Permitted and special uses in the B districts. 
    Uses are allowed in the "B" districts in accordance with section 9-13 and Table II-1. of this zoning ordinance. 
Sec. 9-61. - Standards for the B districts. 
(1)  Specific standards for B districts. Specific minimum and maximum standards for lots, buildings and yards in the B districts are listed in Table VI-1, Business District Standards, of this zoning ordinance. 
(2)  Transitional yard. Wherever a B-zoned lot abuts a residentially zoned lot, then a transitional yard shall be maintained. The requirements for a transitional yard do not apply to the B-5 district. Transitional yards shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  Setback buffer. All structures on the B-zoned lot must be setback a distance that is equal to or greater than the setback requirement for the R-zoned lot. If the B-zoned property abuts two (2) different R districts, then the greater setback shall apply. 
b.  Landscape buffer. A landscape buffer must also be maintained. This buffer shall extend the length of the lot line or segment of the lot line that abuts the residential district, and shall be at least fifteen (15) feet wide. No landscaped buffer is required where a street, alley, or other public right-of-way that is at least ten (10) feet wide separates the B-zoned and R-zoned lots. 
c.  Buffer restrictions. Neither the structure setback buffer nor the landscape buffer shall be used for the purposes of parking, loading, servicing, or storage. 
d.  Screening. Permanent opaque walls or opaque fences at least four (4) feet in height or densely planted shrubbery or plant material at least four (4) feet in height must be maintained. Chain-link fences may not be used to comply with this screening requirement. Additionally, the village board may require a fence in cases where it finds that plant material is insufficient to protect the health, safety and welfare of the adjacent land owners and occupants. 
(3)  Outdoor operations. All business, service and commercial activities must be conducted within completely enclosed buildings unless otherwise expressly allowed in section 9-13 and Table II-1 of this ordinance, or this section of the ordinance. This requirement does not apply to automated teller machines, or to off-street parking and loading or drive-through operations that are otherwise permitted by this ordinance. The village board may waive this provision by designating certain days on which special promotions may be conducted outside the building. 
(4)  Outdoor dining and drinking. On-site outdoor seating areas for the patrons of eating and drinking establishments are allowed as an accessory use so long as the establishment complies with any permitting requirements that the village, from time to time, may establish.

(8)  Specific standards for the BT district. In addition to all other requirements of this ordinance, the following standards apply to the BT district: 
a.  Location. The BT district should be limited to lots fronting streets that experience heavy amounts of vehicular traffic on a daily basis. 
b.  Impact mitigation. The property must be capable of supporting the proposed use in a fashion that limits negative impacts on adjacent residential uses. Sensitive site design, screening, or landscaping will be required to mitigate such negative impacts. 
c.  Preservation of existing structures. Wherever possible, the redevelopment of the lot should not result in demolition of the principle structure. Rehabilitation, restoration, or minor remodeling of the existing structure is encouraged. 
d.  Preservation of significant features. Alterations should not obscure, remove, or modify features that contribute to the historic nature of the building or neighborhood. 
e.  Context. New or remodeled buildings must be designed to be residentially scaled and in character with the neighborhood. 
f.  Buffers. Where the lot is adjacent to a residential district, a landscaped area with a depth of ten (10) feet shall be maintained. The landscaped area shall include a row of shrubs or other densely planted material that, upon maturity, provides 100-percent, year-round visual screening of the lot up to a height of four (4) feet. A fence or wall may be substituted for the landscape buffer. The fence or wall must be at least four (4) feet, must provide 100-percent screening and must be constructed out of materials permitted for fences in R districts. For the purposes of meeting this buffer requirement, chain-link fences are prohibited. 
g.  Parking. Parking shall be provided in accordance with Article IX (Off-Street Parking and Loading) of this ordinance, except as follows: 
i.  Parking areas must be setback from the street a distance that is equal to or greater than the distance from the street to the nearest wall of the principle structure. 
ii.  Drive lanes are allowed in side yards; however, when the lot line nearest the drive lane is adjacent to a residential district, 100-percent, year-round screening shall be required. 
iii.  Parking areas must be designed so as to minimize impacts on adjacent residential uses. Where parking areas are adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of residential uses, a 100-percent, year-round visual screening of the parking areas shall be maintained. The screen can consist of landscaping, fences, or a combination of landscaping and fences. 
h.  Alley access. When vehicle access is provided via an alley, improvements may be required to the alley. Such improvements may include asphalt surfacing, lighting, and storm water management controls. Site access shall be designed to minimize impacts on adjacent properties. 
i.  Fences. Fences shall be permitted. Any fence erected and maintained must conform to the Article X (Fences) of this ordinance. 
(9)  Additional standards for the B-5 district. 
a.  Building location on a lot. The entire facade facing the front lot line or a corner lot line shall be located within twelve (12) feet of that lot line. 
b.  Setback requirements. 
i.  Front setback requirements. No front setback is required, except where a B-5 zoned lot abuts an R-zoned lot. In such cases all structures must be setback a distance that is equal to at least fifty (50) percent of the minimum front setback that exists on the abutting R-zoned lot. If the abutting R-zoned lot is vacant, the 50-percent minimum front setback shall be calculated on the basis of the abutting R district's required front setback. 
ii.  Side setback requirements. No interior side setbacks are prescribed, except where a B-5 zoned lot abuts R-zoned property. In such a cases the an interior side setback of fifteen (15) feet shall be required. 
c.  Parking in front of the building. Parking in the front yard of the lot or in the corner side yard of the lot area is prohibited. This prohibition does not extend to on-street parking. 
d.  Street front windows. All commercial uses, with the exception of financial institutions, shall have street-fronting, ground-level facades that meet all of the following requirements: 
i.  Windows must be of clear, transparent glass that allows views of the store interior or displays windows. 
ii.  Windows must cover at least forty-five (45) percent of the facade. Glass within doors does not count toward this percentage requirement. (See Figure VI-1.) 
iii.  Windows shall not extend to the sidewalk; the lowest portion of window must be at least two (2) feet above the sidewalk. Windows shall not extend to a height of eight (8) feet above the sidewalk. (See Figure VI-1.) Windows may be extended beyond this maximum distance of eight (8) feet if adjacent buildings have storefront windows higher than eight (8) feet. In such cases storefront windows should match generally the size and shape of the storefront windows on the adjacent buildings. 
iv.  The maximum street-fronting facade length without windows shall be ten (10) feet. 
v.  For new development that is adjacent to commercial buildings built before 1950, storefront windows will generally match the size and articulation of the windows on the surrounding buildings. If this provision conflicts with other provisions of this section, the standard that requires the highest amount of storefront windows shall apply. 
e.  Primary entrances. All commercial uses shall have a primary entrance, i.e., the entrance designed for and used by the majority of patrons to enter and exit the establishment, that meets the following requirements: 
i.  The primary entrance shall face and be visible from the street; and 
  

Figure VI-1. Storefront Windows 
In this illustration the first floor facade has an area of two hundred (200) square feet (20 × 10). The area of the two (2) windows meets the minimum standard for storefront windows-they total ninety (90) square feet in area (forty-five (45) percent). The transom and glass within the door are not counted as part of the total. Additionally, the windows are two (2) feet above the sidewalk, but do not extend higher than eight (8) feet above the sidewalk. 
_____ 
ii.  The primary entrance shall be accessible directly from the public sidewalk adjacent to the street. 
f.  Residential uses. Residential uses are permitted in the B-5 district when a commercial structure exists on the lot or when a commercial building is part of a proposed development. Additionally, the following restrictions apply: 
i.  Dwelling units may be permitted on the ground floor only if approved as a special use. (For special use procedures, see section 9-37 of this zoning ordinance.); and 
ii.  Any form of residential parking is prohibited in all portions of the front yard and individual garage doors shall not face the street; and 
iii.  Any form of residential parking is prohibited in any portion of the corner side yard. 
g.  Outdoor uses within the public right-of-way. The following regulations apply to outdoor uses within the public right-of-way (ROW). 
i.  Permitted uses. The following uses may be permitted within the public right-of-way (ROW), provided such use is conducted in accordance with the Village's Design and Operational Guidelines for Outdoor Uses within the Public Right-of-Way and the provisions of this section (g): 
- Outdoor dining and drinking accessory to a use that has as a principal or accessory on-site use that is an eating and drinking establishment, including café/coffee shop/soda fountain, restaurant, specialty food shop, carry-out, brew-pub and microbrewery. 
- Outdoor art instruction and preparation of artwork. 
- Outdoor floral displays and planters. 
- Any other uses found to be similar in nature and clearly compatible as determined by the village planner in accordance with section 9-25, Interpretation by the village planner. 
ii.  Permitted locations. Permitted uses shall be conducted strictly within the ROW directly adjacent to the principal use, i.e., from the side lot lines extended toward the street centerline, or side and rear lot lines extended in the case of corner lots. 
iii.  Extension of principal use. Permitted outdoor uses shall be conducted by the same business license holder as the principal use of the adjoining property. 
iv.  Permit required. Prior to commencing a permitted outdoor use, the applicant is required to obtain a revocable permit from the Village of Plainfield Community Development Department. The permit process is outlined in the village's Design and Operational Guidelines for Outdoor Uses within the Public Right-of-Way. The permit process will verify that the use will be conducted in accordance with the design guidelines, and will also require the applicant to indemnify and hold the village harmless from any damage or claim resulting from the outdoor use, as well as to provide liability insurance listing the village as an additional insured with minimum coverage limits determined by the Village of Plainfield. This permit is a privilege and not a right and may be revoked by the Village of Plainfield-at the discretion of the village administrator or designee, which decision to revoke the permit may be appealed to the village president and board of trustees-for such causes as failure to conduct the outdoor use in compliance with the requirements of this section (g), failure to adhere to the design guidelines, or failure to comply with any additional regulations. 
v.  Additional regulations. Permitted outdoor uses shall also comply with any additional regulations in addition to the zoning ordinance and Design Guidelines for Outdoor Uses within the Public Right-of-Way to the extent such additional regulations apply. Examples include Chapter 4, Article II, Alcoholic Liquors, of the Village of Plainfield Municipal Code, and any requirements of the Will or Kendall County health department.

ARTICLE IX. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 

Sec. 9-71. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to promote successful business operations and enhance residential neighborhoods within the village by setting forth uniform standards for the amount, location and design of off-street parking and loading areas. Implementation of these standards is intended to provide an appropriate amount of parking, reduce traffic congestion, facilitate vehicle movement, enhance vehicle and pedestrian safety, and reduce adverse effects on other nearby land uses and surrounding neighborhoods. 
Sec. 9-72. - Applicability. 
(1)  All zoning districts. The provisions for off-street parking and loading specified in this article shall apply to all zoning districts. Separate standards apply to the downtown area of the village. For a description of this area and the separate standards, see section 9-78, Downtown Parking Zone, of this ordinance. 
(2)  Existing buildings. For existing buildings and existing land uses, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  At time ordinance is adopted. The minimum number of parking spaces designated for specific land uses in this section shall not be applied to existing structures or for structures that have an approved building permit on the effective date of this ordinance. 
b.  Subsequent expansions. If such land, structures or uses are enlarged, expanded or changed, there shall be provided and maintained, for the increment of expansion only, at least the amount of off-street parking space that would be required if the increment were a separate structure or use established or placed into operation after the effective date of this ordinance. 
c.  Change in land use. Where land uses change in an existing building, the parking standards for the new land use shall apply. 
(3)  New buildings. All buildings constructed after the effective date of this ordinance shall provide for parking that conforms to the standards of this ordinance. 
Sec. 9-73. - General standards for off-street parking and loading. 
(1)  Measurements. When units of measurement result in the requirement of a fractional space, any fraction shall require one (1) parking space. Example: A particular property has two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of gross floor area and the land use requires one (1) parking space per three hundred (300) square feet; 2,500/300 = 8.3; therefore nine (9) parking spaces are required. 
(2)  Multi-use buildings and parcels of land. If a building or parcel of land contains more than one land use, the off-street parking and loading requirements shall be based on the sum total of the off-street parking and loading requirements of all of the individual land uses. Shared parking and collective parking arrangements may apply; see section 9-74 and section 9-75. 
(3)  Location of off-street parking. The placement and location of off-street parking stalls and parking lots shall conform to the standards in Figure IX-1 (Placement of Off-Street Parking Lots). 
(4)  Restrictions. 
a.  Vehicle repair. Parking areas shall not be used for the repair, dismantling or servicing of any vehicles, equipment, materials or supplies. Garages for residential properties are exempt from this restriction. 
b.  Inoperable vehicles. Inoperable vehicles shall not be parked or stored in unenclosed parking areas. 
c.  Parking in a front yard. The parking of vehicles or trailers on areas of the front yard other than the driveway is prohibited. 
d.  Trucks, trailers, boats, and RVs. Trucks, trailers, boats and recreational vehicles shall not be parked in a front yard within an R district for more than: 
i.  Eight (8) continuous hours; or 
ii.  Twelve (12) hours within a 24-hour period. 
(5)  Size. 
a.  Required parking for single-family residential uses, including single-family detached, attached or two-family dwellings, shall be at least nine feet by twenty-one feet (9' × 21'). 
b.  Required parking for all other uses shall be at least nine (9) feet in width and at least eighteen (18) feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps, or columns. Such space shall have a vertical clearance of at least seven feet six inches (7'6?), and shall be measured at right angles to the ground. For parallel parking the length of the parking space shall be increased to twenty-two (22) feet. 
Figure IX-1. Placement of Off-Street Parking Lots 
These illustrations are meant to show parking lot placement and may not accurately depict landscaping, setback, or other requirements. 
  

Parking Lot: Between Street and Primary Building 
Parking lot between street and primary building. This relationship of parking, street, and building, with the parking lot between the street and building, is discouraged. The placement of the parking lot between the street and the building is prohibited in the B-5 district. This arrangement is allowed in the B-1 and B-3 districts. 
  

Parking Lot: Side of Building(s) 
Parking lot to the side of the building(s). This type of arrangement is allowed in all zoning districts. It is one of the preferred alternatives to the parking illustration above. 
  

Parking Lot: Rear of Primary Building 
Parking lot in rear of primary building. This type of arrangement is allowed in all zoning districts. 
c.  The number and dimension of parking spaces set aside for the handicapped shall be provided in accordance with the standards of the Illinois capitol development board, as set forth in "Accessibility Standards, Illustrated", dated May 1, 1988, as may be amended from time to time. 
(6)  Access. 
a.  Except on lots accommodating single-family dwellings, each off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway at least the width as provided in the table below, based upon the angle of the parking stalls provided and whether the aisle serves one (1) or two (2) rows of parking spaces.

Sec. 9-74. - Shared parking. 
(1)  Description. Shared parking is an arrangement whereby two (2) or more owners of non-residential properties with different peak-hour parking demands use the same off-street parking spaces to satisfy their off-street parking requirements. 
(2)  Approval. The village director of community development is authorized to make an administrative adjustment allowing shared parking arrangements for non-residential uses with different hours of operation. The director of community development may allow up to one hundred (100) percent of the parking required for a use with peak weekday daytime demand to be supplied with parking spaces provided for a use with peak weekday nighttime or Sunday demand and vice-versa. In order to approve such an administrative adjustment, the director of community development must find that: 
a.  Based on evidence provided by the property owners there is no substantial conflict or overlap in the principal operating hours for which the shared parking is proposed; and 
b.  The shared parking facility is located within three hundred (300) feet walking distance of each of the uses, as measured from the entrance of each use to the nearest parking space in the facility. 
c.  There are convenient, visible pedestrian connections between the facility and all of the sharing properties. 
(3)  Agreement. The parties involved shall execute an agreement on the shared parking and file it with the director of community development. The shared parking shall remain in effect only so long as the agreement remains in force. If the agreement is no longer in force, then the property owners must provide parking as otherwise required by this ordinance. 
Sec. 9-75. - Collective parking and reduction in parking requirements. 
(1)  Description. Collective parking is an arrangement whereby two (2) or more commercial properties use the same parking lot to fulfill their off-street parking requirements. 
(2)  Approval. For such an arrangement, the director of community development is authorized to make an administrative adjustment that reduces the off-street parking requirements for each participating commercial property by twenty (20) percent. In order to approve such an administrative adjustment, the director of community development must find that: 
a.  The collective parking facility is located within six hundred (600) feet walking distance of each of the uses, as measured from the entrance of each use to the nearest parking space in the facility. 
b.  There are convenient, visible pedestrian connections between the facility and all of the sharing properties. 
(3)  Agreement. The parties involved shall execute an agreement on the collective parking and file it with the director of community development. The collective parking shall remain in effect only so long as the agreement remains in force. If the agreement is no longer in force, then the property owners must provide parking as otherwise required by this ordinance. 
Sec. 9-76. - Location of off-street parking. 
(1)  Residential garages. For provisions of concerning residential garages, see section 9-17. 
(2)  Location of off-street parking lots. The placement and location of off-street parking stalls and parking lots shall conform to the standards contained in Figure IX-1. 
Sec. 9-77. - Downtown parking zone. 
(1)  Purpose. The Downtown Parking Zone (DPZ) approximates an area that historically has been the village's downtown and also includes the area around Village Hall. Generally, the DPZ is occupied with older commercial and residential buildings on small lots. Such development-which occurred before the current level of automobile use in today's society-often means that parcels are not of an adequate size to accommodate the required number of off-street parking spaces. The DPZ allows for an area-wide approach to solving the parking demands of the downtown area. The relaxation in parking requirements for the DPZ is intended to encourage the preservation of older buildings, create a pedestrian-friendly environment, and ensure robust economic activity for commercial establishments in the area. 
(2)  Standards. 
a.  Exemption from parking requirements. Small residential and business land uses within the DPZ are exempt from the minimum parking requirements of this section. However, If a commercial land use has a gross floor area of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more, then the standards contained in Table XI-1 (Schedule of Off-Street Parking) shall apply. 
b.  Inclusion of on-street parking. If parking is required of a particular use in the DPZ, all on-street parking spaces within one hundred fifty (150) feet and any parking spaces within municipal parking lots within three hundred (300) feet may be included in the calculation for the required number of off-street parking spaces. Such distances shall be measured from the customer entrance to the commercial use to the parking spaces. 
c.  Maximum off-street parking limits. Commercial establishments within the DPZ shall not provide a number of off-street parking spaces that is greater than one hundred (100) percent of the parking requirement for that particular establishment's land use found in Table XI-1 (Schedule of Off-Street Parking). 
d.  Other parking arrangements. Shared parking and collective parking arrangements (see section 9-74 and section 9-75) are permissible and encouraged. 
e.  Administrative adjustment. The village director of community development may grant administrative adjustment of parking requirements for noncommercial and nonresidential land uses within the DPZ. In order to approve such an administrative adjustment, the director of community development must find that: 
i.  Based on evidence provided by the property owner, parking demand for the property can be met with available on- and off-street parking in the immediate vicinity; and 
ii.  An administrative adjustment of the parking requirements will have minimal adverse effects on other nearby land uses and surrounding neighborhoods; and 
iii.  Strict adherence to the parking requirements of Table IX-1 would cause undue hardship for the property owner.

ARTICLE XII. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 9-102. - General. 
(1)  Intent. This article governs nonconformities: those uses, lots, buildings or other aspects of development that may have complied with previous zoning regulations, but through zoning ordinance revisions or amendments no longer conform to the current regulations. The intent of this chapter is to clarify to what extent and under what circumstances such nonconformities can be altered, expanded, or allowed to continue. Other intentions of this chapter are to: allow for the preservation and reuse of existing buildings; recognize the interests of landowners whose property and its uses were lawfully established, and place reasonable limits on nonconformities that have or potentially may have adverse effects on surrounding properties or the community. 
(2)  Authority to continue a nonconformity. Any nonconformity that existed on August 15, 2006, or situation that becomes a nonconformity upon adoption of any amendment to this zoning ordinance may be continued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(3)  Continued status of nonconformity. Nonconforming status rests with the property, not with the owner. Such status is not affected by changes in ownership, tenancy, or management. 
(4)  Repairs and maintenance. Nonconforming buildings and lots carry the same obligations and requirements for safe upkeep as conforming buildings and lots. Incidental repairs and normal maintenance necessary to keep a nonconformity in compliance with the village building code are permitted unless otherwise expressly prohibited in this ordinance. 
Sec. 9-103. - Nonconforming lots. 
(1)  Nonconforming lots in R districts. The following provisions shall apply: 
a.  A nonconforming lot in an R district may be developed with a single-family house, providing setback requirements and bulk and density standards are met. 
b.  Likewise, a nonconforming lot that is enlarged, yet remains nonconforming may be developed with a single-family house, providing setback, bulk and density restrictions are met. 
c.  If an existing single-family house in an R district is destroyed by accident, it may be rebuilt, providing setback, bulk and density restrictions are met. 
d.  Non-residential development of a non-conforming lot in an R district may occur only if the zoning board of appeals grants a variance for any and all of the nonconformities that result from inadequate lot area or lot width (e.g., parking requirements cannot be met). 
(2)  Nonconforming lots in other districts. In nonresidential zoning districts, a nonconforming lot may be developed providing that: 
a.  The lot in question existed in its current dimensions at the time of the effective date of this ordinance; and 
b.  The use is permitted in the zoning district where the nonconforming lot is located; and 
c.  The zoning board of appeals grants variances for any other nonconformities that result from inadequate lot area or lot width (e.g., parking requirements cannot be met). 
Sec. 9-104. - Nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Change of nonconforming use. 
a.  To a permitted use. A nonconforming use may be converted to a use permitted in the subject zoning district. 
b.  To another nonconforming use. A nonconforming use may not be changed to another nonconforming use. 
(2)  Expansion of nonconforming use. A nonconforming use, whether inside or outside of a building, may not be expanded beyond the area it occupies at the time of the adoption of this ordinance or any subsequent amendment. 
(3)  Discontinuance of nonconforming use. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, it shall not be reestablished. 
(4)  Relocation. No building in which a nonconforming use is conducted may be moved in whole or in part to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the use of that lot conforms to the regulations of the zoning district in which the building is to be moved. 
Sec. 9-105. - Nonconforming buildings. 
(1)  Alterations or enlargements of nonconforming buildings. A nonconforming building may be altered or enlarged only if the alterations or enlargements do not increase the extent of the nonconformity or add another nonconformity. For example, a building that does not meet a setback requirement may add an additional floor so long as the additional height and bulk comply with the applicable regulations. Likewise, a building that does not meet a setback requirement may be enlarged so long as the addition follows the same building wall line and does not result in an additional encroachment into the setback area. 
(2)  Destruction or damage of nonconforming buildings. 
a.  Intentional destruction. If a nonconforming building is intentionally removed or destroyed by the owner, the building may be reconstructed, provided that all nonconformities, to include setbacks, are eliminated in the new building.

Sec. 9-130. - Tree replacement. 
1.  General. In order to preserve existing trees on a property, the village board may impose necessary and appropriate conditions to minimize any adverse impacts on trees located on the property. In the case of residential plats, a part of any subdivision design shall include efforts to design the subdivision to protect tree stands or groves and wooded areas. For any property; residential, commercial or industrial, being considered for development that has existing trees on the site, the following shall be required: 
(a)  A minimum of fifty (50) percent of the trees on the site that are greater than eight (8) inches diameter at breast height (DBH) shall be saved. In the event a tree has more than one trunk, each trunk which is greater than eight (8) inches DBH, shall count as a separate tree. The developer is encouraged to save as many trees as possible. 
(b)  A tree survey showing the location, species, trunk diameter and condition of every tree eight (8) inches DBH or larger on the property is required as part of the preliminary plat. The survey shall also show the location, size, species, and condition of each tree. The village planner or his/her designee may allow the tree survey to exclude those portions of the site which they determine will not be affected by the development activity. For those areas of significant vegetation (fifty (50) percent or greater contiguous lot coverage by existing vegetation) with no development activity identified, the tree survey may not need to identify each tree but said area may be identified on the survey as a tree protection area. In such cases emphasis will be placed on maintaining the contiguous plantings, and keeping disruption confined to the perimeter of the tree protection area. 
(c)  Prior to commencing any grading or construction activity on a site, the developer shall tag the trees that are planned to be removed and fence off an area large enough to accommodate the construction of the building/structure and accessory uses and appurtenances. Trees to be saved in any development shall be surrounded by orange plastic or red picket snow fencing placed ten (10) feet beyond the dripline of each such tree. The area within this fence shall be known as the Root Preservation Zone. The snow fencing shall be secured in place by posts spaced six (6) feet apart and sunk two (2) feet into the ground with a minimum above ground height of four (4) feet. 
(d)  No mechanical vehicles or construction machinery shall be allowed within any fenced off area surrounding a tree to be saved. In addition, any construction activity which endangers the health of any tree in the fenced off area shall be prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, stockpiling of materials within the Root Preservation Zone, flooding and the deposit of wash water in the root preservation zone. 
(e)  If, in the opinion of the village planner or his/her designee, there is not adequate room on the site for all of the replacement trees, a dollar amount which corresponds to the unplantable trees shall be used to plant parkway trees elsewhere in the village. The location of these trees shall be determined by the village engineer. 
(f)  All replacement trees shall be guaranteed to live and thrive for up to one year after village acceptance of the improvements. Documentation of the guarantee shall be provided to the village engineer prior to acceptance of the improvements. In the event that a replacement tree dies or is in a declining condition, the tree shall be replaced by the party bound by the guarantee with another tree of the same species and size. 
2.  Removal and replacement criteria. To the extent that the development is likely to result in the destruction of or material damage to any tree having a DBH of eight (8) inches or more, the applicant shall be required to replace such trees as specified below: 
(a)  Replacement trees shall be a minimum of three (3) inches in DBH and the species and location shall be identified on the plans. Replacement trees shall be in addition to other landscaping required by village Code. 
Diameter of 
Existing Tree 
(inches) Number of 
Replacement Trees  8 to 12 2 12.1 to 24 3 24.1 to 36 4 36.1 to 48 5 48.1 and greater 6 - plus 1 tree for each 
additional 12-inch 
diameter greater 
than 48.1 inches  
(b)  All trees greater than eight (8) inches in diameter which are severely diseased or structurally unsound shall be labeled as such on the tree survey. If, in the opinion of the village planner or his/her designee, corrective measures would be ineffective toward saving these trees and the trees pose a threat to the health, safety and welfare of the community, these trees shall not count towards the total number of trees to be preserved or replaced. 
(c)  Trees located in proposed rights-of-way shall not be considered preservable, but shall be compensated for as required above. 
(d)  The village, at its discretion, has the right to retain a professional tree consultant/forester to review submitted tree preservation plans and submit a written report to the plan commission. All expense incurred by the village for the use of the tree consultant shall be reimbursed by the developer. 
Sec. 9-131. - Boulevards. 
    Where boulevards are proposed, final approval of the design shall rest with the village planner or his/her designee. Design shall incorporate a mixture of trees, shrubs, perennials, annuals and hardscape elements. Selected plant material shall be such that it will withstand heat, drought, salt and/or other environmental conditions that may affect a particular site. 
    Several elements shall be considered when designing boulevards. They include: 
(a)  Boulevards shall not be less than thirty (30) feet in width, although they may taper at either or both ends. 
(b)  Trees shall be planted on a spacing of twenty-five (25) feet. 
(c)  Boulevards shall be landscaped with not less than seventy-five (75) percent live plant materials. 
(d)  The balance of the boulevard islands shall include hardscape elements such as benches, unit pavers, decorative fencing, natural rock outcroppings, art sculptures, or other elements deemed appropriate by the village planner or his/her designee. 
(e)  Any area not occupied by trees, shrubs, perennials, annuals, mulch or hardscape materials shall be sodded. 
(f)  In no case shall a median or boulevard planting be completely mulched without prior approval.

Sec. 9-149. - Certificate of appropriateness. 
(1)  Concept review. 
a.  Purpose: A concept plan may be submitted for the purpose of obtaining the historic preservation commission's comments and recommendations prior to the owner spending significant time and expense in the preparation of detailed plans and architectural drawings and applying for a certificate of appropriateness. 
b.  Procedure: The property owner requesting a concept review shall submit a preliminary drawing of any exterior alterations or construction, current photographs of the property, historic photographs (if available), a map or survey showing locations of all structures on the property, and a list of proposed materials. The owner shall present the concept plan at a commission meeting. 
c.  After discussion with the owner, the commission may make a preliminary determination whether the proposed work complies with the established criteria, and may make recommendations as to any changes that would bring the proposal into compliance. 
(2)  Certificate of appropriateness-When required. 
a.  Except as provided herein, a certificate of appropriateness is required prior to issuance of a permit for minor and major work involving any new and other construction, alteration, repair, demolition, relocation or other material change that may affect the exterior architectural appearance of any structure or site within an historic district or of any designated landmark building or site. 
b.  An application for a certificate of appropriateness shall not be required for certain projects. Projects which do not require a certificate of appropriateness include, but are not limited to, those listed below: 
i.  Change in exterior paint schemes or colors; 
ii.  Ordinary repair and maintenance of existing exterior architectural features which do not permanently alter or modify the features and do not require a building permit; 
iii.  Replacement of existing outside storage sheds; 
iv.  Installation, removal, or change in landscaping; 
v.  Repairs to private concrete or asphalt sidewalks, and all sidewalks, curbs, streetlights, fire hydrants and street signs within the public right-of-way; 
vi.  Replacement of existing mechanical and electrical service equipment; 
c.  The requirement for a certificate of appropriateness may be waived in emergency circumstances which require immediate relief, repair, or demolition, where the fire chief or building official certifies that such conditions exist and that said conditions can be eliminated as quickly as is needed only if the certificate of appropriateness is waived. 
d.  In the event any building, structure, or other feature should be damaged by fire or other calamity, or by Act of Nature, or by the public enemy to such an extent that, in the opinion of the aforesaid official or officials, it cannot reasonably be repaired and restored, it may be removed or demolished in conformity with normal permit procedures and applicable laws. Subsections (3) and (4) shall apply only in cases where it is impractical for the commission to review a certificate of appropriateness. 
(3)  Certificate of appropriateness-Procedure. 
a.  Where a certificate of appropriateness is required, the community development department shall furnish applicants with an application for a certificate of appropriateness. 
b.  Within ten (10) days following receipt by the community development department of an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the community development department shall notify the chairperson of the historic preservation commission. 
c.  The commission shall review an application for a certificate of appropriateness within twenty-one (21) days after notification by the community development department. Plans and specifications for exterior work submitted with the permit application shall be made available to the commission. The community development department shall notify the applicant of the time and place of the meeting. 
d.  Tabling the application shall be considered action by the commission provided, however, that any such delay shall not exceed twenty-one (21) days unless the applicant has not provided the additional documentation or expert technical advice requested. 
e.  The commission may table the application for a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that additional documentation or expert technical advice from outside its membership is needed to properly evaluate the application. The commission may hold an additional meeting or meetings to consider the application not more than twenty-one (21) days from receipt of all requested documentation and technical advice. 
f.  The commission shall approve an application for a certificate of appropriateness for projects where it is required and that meet the applicable criteria for "minor work." These projects include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: 
i.  Addition of outside storage and mechanical and electrical service equipment not visible from a public street or sidewalk either because of location or landscaping; 
ii.  Application or use of exterior roofing materials of the same kind, type, or texture as that already in use, if appropriate; 
iii.  Improvements, alterations, and renovations that can be accomplished without obtaining a building permit, including, but not limited to, screening and siding using the same material as when the building was first constructed; 
iv.  Erection, alteration, or removal of features associated with a physical or medical condition of an occupant, clients or customers, but which do not permanently alter exterior features, including access ramps or lifts; 
v.  Replacement of fences of the same type and material in the same location; 
vi.  Installation of or change in, storm doors, storm windows, and screens; 
vii.  Other such projects that are determined to be minor work, either through consistent interpretation of this ordinance, or by determination of either the historic preservation commission or the village board. 
g.  If the commission finds that the work proposed in the application meets the applicable criteria of subsection (4) of this section, and is considered "major work" that will not impair the integrity of contributing structures within a historic district, it shall recommend to the village board approval of a certificate of appropriateness. The recommendation shall state its findings and reasonings, which will be forwarded to the village board. 
h.  If the commission finds on a preliminary basis that the work proposed in the application does not meet the applicable criteria of this article, it may make recommendations to the applicant concerning changes that would cause the work proposed in the application to meet the applicable criteria and may confer with the applicant in an attempt to resolve any differences between the applicant's plan and the applicable criteria. 
i.  If the commission finds that the work proposed in the application does not meet the applicable criteria and will therefore adversely affect or destroy historically or architecturally significant features of a landmark or of a building, structure, or site within a designated historic district, it shall recommend denial of a certificate of appropriateness. The recommendation shall state its findings and reasonings, which will be forwarded to the village board. 
Upon subsequent denial, the applicant may submit an amended application to address the findings and recommendations of the commission and the village board. If the commission finds that the amended application conforms to the findings and recommendations of the commission and the village board and to the applicable criteria set forth in this article, it shall issue a certificate of appropriateness, and no further action by the village board will be necessary. 
j.  A certificate of appropriateness shall be invalid if: 
i.  Changes have been made to the plans subsequent to the approval of the commission or village board; or 
ii.  The permit issued for the work becomes invalid. A certificate of appropriateness remains in force for the same period of validity as the permit. 
k.  The applicant may submit an application for a certificate of economic hardship upon denial of a certificate of appropriateness pursuant to the following section. 
(4)  Certificate of appropriateness-Criteria. In making a determination whether to recommend approval or denial of an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall be guided by the following criteria: 
a.  The significance of a site, structure, or building: 
i.  The commission shall apply the maximum flexibility allowed by this chapter in its review of applications for new construction and for alteration, removal, or demolition of structures that have little architectural or historic significance. However, if the new construction, alteration, removal or demolition would seriously impair or destroy historically or architecturally significant features of a landmark or of a building, structure, or site within a designated historic district, the commission shall give due consideration to protection of those historically and architecturally significant features. 
ii.  The following properties are presumed to have architecturally or historically significant features: 1) Properties within a designated historic district that are classified as architecturally or historically significant by a survey conducted pursuant to the duties assigned to the commission; 2) Properties designated as landmarks pursuant to section 9-147 of this chapter, and 3) all properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
iii.  The following properties will sometimes have architecturally or historically significant features: Properties within a designated historic district that are classified as architecturally or historically contributing pursuant by a survey conducted pursuant to the duties assigned to the commission and pursuant to section 2-200.3 of this Code. 
iv.  The following properties will usually have little architectural or historic significance: Properties within a designated historic district that are classified as architecturally or historically non-contributing by a survey conducted pursuant to the duties assigned to the commission and pursuant to section 2-200.3 of this Code. 
b.  General design guidelines: 
i.  Height: The height of any proposed alteration or construction should be compatible with the style and character of the structure and with surrounding structures. 
ii.  Proportions of the front facade: The relationship between the width of a building and the height of the front elevation should be compatible with surrounding structures. 
iii.  Proportions of windows and doors: The proportions and relationships between doors and windows should be compatible with the architectural style and character of the building. 
iv.  Relationship of building masses and spaces: The relationship of a structure to the open space between it and adjoining structures should be compatible. 
v.  Roof shapes: The design of the roof, fascia, and cornice should be compatible with the architectural style and character of the building and with adjoining structures. 
vi.  Scale: The scale of the structure after alteration, construction, or partial demolition should be compatible with its architectural style and character and with the surrounding structures. 
vii.  Directional expression: Facades in historic districts should blend with and reflect the dominant horizontal or vertical expression of adjacent structures. The directional expression of a building after alteration, construction, or partial demolition should be compatible with its original architectural style and character. 
viii.  Architectural details: Architectural details should be treated so as to make a building compatible with its original architectural style and character and to not detract from the inherent characteristics of surrounding structures. 
ix.  Appurtenances: New, replaced, or restored appurtenances shall be sensitive to the individual building or structure, its occupants, and their needs. 
x.  New structures: New structures in a historic district shall be compatible with, but need not be the same as, the architectural styles and general designs and layouts of the surrounding structures. 
c.  The U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation: 
i.  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
ii.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
iii.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
iv.  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
v.  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. 
vi.  Deteriorated historical features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
vii.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
viii.  Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
ix.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
x.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(5)  Code conflicts. Where there are irreconcilable differences between the requirements of the codes (building code and other codes) adopted by the Village of Plainfield and the requirements of this article, conformance to these codes shall take precedence.

i.  Form of ownership or operation of the property, whether sole proprietorship, for profit or not-for-profit corporation, limited partnership, joint venture or other. 
j.  An estimate from an architect, developer, real estate consultant, appraiser, or other real estate professional experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of the existing structure on the property. 
k.  A report from a licensed architect or engineer with experience in rehabilitation as to the structural soundness of any structures on the property and their suitability for rehabilitation. 
l.  Any other information reasonably necessary for a determination as to whether the property can be reasonably used or yield a reasonable return to present or future owners. 
(3)  After reviewing the application and any other information available, the commission shall make a recommendation to the village board regarding the application for a certificate of economic hardship. 
(4)  If the village board finds that without approval of the proposed work the property cannot obtain a reasonable economic return, it may issue a certificate of economic hardship; as an alternative, it may delay the issuance of a certificate of economic hardship for a period of up to three (3) months. During this time, the village board shall invite plans and recommendations from the commission or any interested party, to provide for a reasonable beneficial use or a reasonable economic return, or to otherwise preserve the subject property. 
(5)  Such plans and recommendations may include, but not be limited to, a relaxation of the provisions of this ordinance, financial assistance, the application of building code requirements, and/or changes in zoning regulations. 
(6)  If, by the end of this three (3) month period, the village board determines that no viable alternative is available and the property cannot be put to a reasonably beneficial use or the owner cannot obtain a reasonable economic return, then it shall issue a certificate of economic hardship approving the proposed work. 
(7)  The village board shall consider the recommendations of the commission in deciding whether to issue the certificate of economic hardship, but may overturn the commission's recommendation if, in its sole discretion, it finds such action appropriate. 
Sec. 9-151. - Subdivision, planned unit development, and zoning review process. 
(1)  Upon receipt of a petition for: 1) approval of a preliminary plat for a subdivision or planned unit development; 2) a zoning map amendment; or 3) a variance of the zoning ordinance or subdivision control ordinance for any property within an historic district, the community development department shall notify the owner of record of said property that such petition will be reviewed by the commission subject to the provisions of this article. 
(2)  Within thirty (30) days of notice of a petition concerning zoning amendments or variances, the commission shall hold a public hearing and provide written comments to the plan commission or zoning board of appeals, as the case may be, describing recommendations to enhance the proposed project relative to character of the district, including, but not limited to, yard setbacks and building scale.

No additional commission review shall be required at the time of issuance of a building permit for any improvement within said subdivision or planned unit development which has since been approved by the village board provided, however, that said improvement is consistent with the approved plans. 
Sec. 9-152. - Ordinary maintenance. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior feature of any improvement designated as a landmark or any improvement located within a historic district which does not involve change in such improvement's design or materials, or in any exterior architectural feature of the improvement. 
Sec. 9-153. - Natural demolition. 
    In the case of partial or complete natural demolition of a site within a historic district or of a landmark, the owner will be required to obtain a certificate of appropriateness from the commission prior to reconstruction.

(1)  The exterior design of the structure prior to damage, and 
(2)  The character of the historic district or surrounding structures 
Sec. 9-154. - Affirmation of zoning.

Note- Pursuant to the adoption of the Illinois Compiled Statutes, this table has been established in addition to the Statutory Reference Table beginning on p. 1353. As Code pages are pulled for supplementation, Ill. Rev. Stat. references deleted from the table will be replaced by appropriate ILCS references consequently resulting in complete replacement of the original Ill. Rev. Stat. table, at which time it will be deleted.
