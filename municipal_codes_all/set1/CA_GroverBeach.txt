CHAPTER 4 - ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS FOR VIOLATION OF CODE 

Sec. 1400. Administrative Citations and Penalties.  The City Council finds that there is a need for an alternative method of enforcement of violations of the Municipal Code. The City Council further finds and declares that an appropriate method for enforcement for violations of the Code is the following administrative citation and civil penalty program. 
(A) 
Administrative Citation.  Any person violating any provision of the Code may be issued an administrative citation by a citation officer as provided in this article. A separate civil penalty for each violation of the Code may be assessed by means of one administrative citation. 

(B) 
Contents.  Upon discovering or observing any violation of the Municipal Code, a citation officer may issue an administrative citation, in a form approved by the City Manager, to a violator or property owner, with the following contents: 

(1) 
Date and location of the violation(s), including the street address, if any, and the approximate time the violation(s) were observed; 

(2) 
The citation shall include a statement specifying the behaviors which constitute the nuisance; 

(3) 
Description of the action required to correct the violation(s), if applicable; and if applicable, the date by which the violation must be corrected; 

(4) 
Statement explaining the consequences of failure to correct the violation(s); 

(5) 
Amount of penalty imposed for the violation(s); 



(6) 
Explanation of how the penalty shall be paid and the time period by which it shall be paid, and the consequences of failure to pay the penalty; 

(7) 
Right to contest the contents of the administrative citation and right of appeal, including the name and address of the City Manager for purposes of filing any notice of appeal; and 

(8) 
Signature of the enforcement officer and the signature of the violator if he can be located, as outlined herein. 

(C) 
Issuance.  The citation officer shall attempt to locate the responsible party for any violation of this Code. For purposes of issuance of a citation to a business, the citation may be issued to the person in immediate control of the business on site at the time of the issuance of the administrative citation and penalty. The citation officer shall attempt to obtain the signature of the person upon whom the citation was issued. However, the lack of signature shall in no way affect the validity of the citation and subsequent proceedings. 

(D) 
Issuance When Unable to Locate Violator.  If the citation officer is unable to locate the violator(s) then the administrative citation shall be mailed to the responsible party and property owner, if different than the responsible party. The administrative citation shall be mailed to the violator(s) or property owner(s) by certified and first class mail. The failure of any person with an interest in the property to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken under this chapter. Notice by certified and first class mail in the manner described above shall become effective on the date of mailing. 

(E) 
Imposition of Penalty.  A citation issued for a continuing violation of a building, plumbing, electrical or other structural or zoning regulation, that does not create an immediate danger to public health or safety, may not be issued until the responsible party has been given a reasonable period of time by the City to correct the violation through a notice of violation, notice and order or other type of corrective notice. 

I-7 Amended July 1, 2006 

(F) 
Appeal.  Any person issued an administrative citation may contest the contents of the administrative citation by filing an appeal under Section 1408 below. If no appeal is filed within the time prescribed, the penalty shall be final and immediately payable. 

(G) 
Penalty.  Except as otherwise set forth in this Code, or by the Master Fee Resolution, the City Council establishes the following base schedule for determining the amount of the civil penalty to be assessed for each code violation specified in the administrative citation. 

(1) 
First violation within a rolling twelve-month period, in the amount designated in the Master Fee Schedule; 

(2) 
Second occurrence of the same violation within a rolling twelve-month period, two and one-half (2 ½) times the amount designated in the Master Fee Schedule for a first violation; 

(3) 
Third or subsequent occurrence of the same violation within a rolling twelve-month period, five times the amount designated in the Master Fee Schedule for a first violation; 

(H) 
Failure to Correct.  If the violator or property owner fails to correct the violation, subsequent administrative citations and penalties may be issued for the same violation(s) or the City may institute any other applicable action permissible under this Code to gain compliance. The amount of the penalty for each subsequent violation of the same Code provision shall increase at a rate specified in this article. 

(I) 
Each violation of this Code shall be a separate offense for each and every day during any portion of which any violation of any provision of this Code is committed, continued, or permitted by such person and shall be charged accordingly. 

(J) 
Payment of Fine Without Correction of Violation.  Payment of any penalty shall not excuse the failure to correct the violation nor shall it bar further enforcement action by the City. The failure of any person to pay any penalty assessed by administrative citation within the time specified on the administrative citation shall result in the assessment of an additional late fee to be charged. The amount of the late fee shall be ten percent of the total amount of the civil penalty due and owing. 

(K) 
Collection of Penalty.  The City shall collect delinquent or unpaid penalties as follows: costs or penalties subject to collection under this article may be recovered as a personal obligation against the responsible party and may be referred to a collection agency or the City Attorney's Office for collection. Upon referral of these costs and obligations, the collection agency and the City Attorney's Office may seek collection through any legal means provided to them, including judicial action. Nothing in this section shall be affected by or affect the City's use of any other procedure provided in this article or by law to collect unpaid costs and penalties. In a judicial action to recover abatement costs, the City Attorney's Office may elect to recover attorney's fees.   

(L) 
Authority to Issue Administrative Citation.

(Ord. 06-10)

(1)
 Use of Meter. Any noise measurement made pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be made with a sound level meter using the A-weighted network (scale) at slow meter response.  Fast meter response shall be used for impulsive type sounds.  Calibration of the measurement equipment utilizing an acoustical calibrator shall be performed, immediately prior to recording any noise data. 

(2)
 Measuring Exterior Noise Levels. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, exterior noise levels shall be measured at the property line of the affected noise-sensitive land use listed in Section 3120.7. Where practical, the microphone shall be positioned three (3) to five (5) feet above the ground and away from reflective surfaces. 

(3)
 Measuring Interior Noise Levels. Interior noise levels shall be measured within the affected residential use listed in Section 3120.9 at points at least four (4) feet from the wall, ceiling or floor nearest the noise source, with windows in the normal seasonal configuration.  The reported interior noise level shall be determined by taking the arithmetic average of the readings taken at the various microphone locations. 

(4)
 Commercial Areas Bordering Residential Area.  The measurement from the residential area towards the commercial shall be held to the residential standard. (Ord. 04-07) 

Sec. 3120.8 Exterior Noise Limits. (A) Maximum Permissible Sound Levels at Receiving Land Use. 

(1)
 No person shall permit any source of sound at any location within the City or allow the creation of any noise on property owned, leased, occupied or otherwise controlled by the person, which causes the noise level to exceed the noise standard for that land use as specified in Table 1 of this section. 

(2)
 If the measurement location is on a boundary between two different zones, the noise level limit applicable to the lower noise zone plus five (5) dBA shall apply. 

(3)
 If possible, the ambient noise should be measured at the same location along the property line utilized in this section, with the alleged offending noise source inoperative.  If for any reason the alleged offending noise source cannot be shut down, the ambient noise may be estimated by performing a measurement in the same general area of the source but at a sufficient distance such that the noise from the source is at least ten (10) dBA below the ambient in order that only the ambient level be measured.  If the difference between the ambient plus the noise source and noise source is five (5) to ten (10) dBA, then the level of the source itself can be reasonably determined by subtracting a one decibel correction to account for the contribution of the source.

CHAPTER 7.5 - VEHICLE IMPOUND RELEASE FEE 
Sec. 3751. Purpose. It is the intent of this chapter to recover the costs involved in the lawful impounding of private vehicles pursuant to the specific California Vehicle Code sections which result from some unlawful act or omission by the owner or driver.  This would be accomplished by establishing a fee to obtain a vehicle impound release from the police department.  The vehicle impound release is evidence that the police department has removed its hold on the vehicle.  The form will be required to obtain the release of the vehicle from the towing company.  Through the enactment of a vehicle impound release fee, it is hoped that the persons having their vehicle impounded by the police department as a result of their disobedience of the law, will correct the unlawful conditions causing the impound and eliminate the need for further enforcement.  By doing so, existing police resources can be more effectively and efficiently deployed toward higher priority safety situations. (Ord. 94-8) 
Sec. 3752. Definitions. Any term defined in this chapter shall have the meaning contained therein for the purpose of this chapter unless otherwise expressly stated or the content clearly indicates a different intention. (Ord. 94-8) 
Sec. 3753. Vehicle Impound Release Fee. There is imposed a fee upon any vehicle's current registered owner, the legal owner, or his or her designate, seeking to obtain a vehicle impound release from the police department where such vehicle has been impounded pursuant to the provisions of the California Vehicle Code. Such a vehicle impound release indicates to the towing company in possession of the impounded vehicle that the police department no longer has a hold on the vehicle 
III-46 

and that it is cleared to be released. The vehicle impound release fee shall be set forth by resolution.  (Ord. 94-8) 
Sec. 3754. Criteria for Vehicle Impound Release Fee Imposition. Vehicles deemed as impounded by the police department shall be subject to the imposition of the vehicle impound release fee at the time such release is sought by the owner. (Ord. 94-8) 
Sec. 3755. Exceptions to Fee Imposition. The vehicle impound release fee shall not be applied to impounded vehicles which meet any of the following criteria: 
(A) 
When the vehicle is a recovered stolen vehicle and the vehicle is being released to the registered owner or his/her designate [Vehicle Code Section 22651(c)]; 

(B) 
When the vehicle was taken as evidence, or as the container of evidence or as a part of a criminal investigation and the owner of the vehicle was a witness to or a victim of a crime and not the suspect in such investigation; 

(C) When the vehicle was impounded in error; 

(D) 
When the chief of police or designate determines after a post-storage hearing where one has been requested that the facts disclosed at such hearing warrant a waiver of the fee; 

(E) 
When the vehicle was stored pursuant to injured or ill driver of an accident [Vehicle Code Section 22651(g)]. (Ord. 94-8)

CHAPTER 9 - MASSAGE THERAPY REGULATIONS 
Sec. 3900. Purpose and intent. (A) In enacting this chapter, the City Council recognizes that commercial massage therapy is a professional pursuit which can offer the public valuable health and therapeutic services. The City Council further recognizes that, unless properly regulated, the practice of massage therapy and the operation of massage businesses may be associated with unlawful activity and pose a threat to the quality of life in the local community. Accordingly, it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by providing for the orderly regulation of businesses providing massage therapy services, discouraging prostitution and related illegal activities carried on under the guise of massage therapy, and establishing certain sanitation, health, and operational standards for massage businesses. 
(B) Furthermore, it is the Council's purpose and intent to rely upon the uniform statewide regulations applicable to massage practitioners and establishments that were enacted by the State Legislature in 2008 as Business and Professions Code sections 4600 et seq. by Senate Bill 731, amended in 2011 by Assembly Bill 619, amended in 2014 by Assembly Bill 1147, and amended in 2016 by Assembly Bill 2194 which also amended Government Code section 51034, to restrict the commercial practice of massage in the City to those persons duly certified to practice by the California Massage Therapy Council, and to provide for the registration and regulation of massage businesses for health and safety purposes to the extent allowed by law.

Sec. 3996.43. Application for Rent Adjustment/Evaluation/Relevant Factors. In evaluating the application, the hearing officer may consider, along with all other factors it considers relevant, changes in costs to the owner attributable to increases or decreases in master land and/or facilities lease rent, utility rates, property taxes, insurance, advertising, variable mortgage interest rates, employee costs, normal repair and maintenance, and other considerations, including, but not limited to, rehabilitation work, capital improvements, upgrading and addition of amenities or services, net operating income, and the level of rent necessary to permit a just and reasonable return on the owner's property. 
(A) 
In applying the foregoing factors, the hearing officer shall utilize the maintenance of net operating income (MNOI) formula.  Under the MNOI allowable gross rents are calculated as follows:  all operating expenses for the twelve-month period ending June 30, 1987, are subtracted from all operating expenses for the twelve-month period immediately preceding the date of the application for which expense data is available. In the event operating expenses are not available for the period ending June 30, 1987, then expenses for a twelve-month period reasonably close to June 30, 1987, may be substituted.  The difference shall be added to gross annual rent based on rental rates in effect on July 1, 1987.  The sum shall be the allowable gross annual space rent. The allowable gross space rent shall be fairly apportioned between all spaces in the park. The space rent determined under the MNOI formula shall be adjusted as follows: 

(1)
 There shall be an adjustment to allow for inflation calculated as follows:  the net operating income (NOI) for the base period shall be calculated by subtracting the park's operating expenses for the twelve-month period ending June 30, 1987, from the park's annual gross space rent based on the space rent in effect on July 1, 1987. The CPI index for the month most recently available prior to filing the application shall be divided by the CPI index for July 1987.  The resulting quotient shall be multiplied by the base period NOI. This shall be the adjusted NOI.  The operating expenses for the twelve-month period immediately preceding the date of the application for which information is available shall be added to the adjusted NOI. The sum shall be the inflation-adjusted gross space rent.  The allowable space rent shall be the greater of the space rent calculated using the MNOI formula and the space rent adjusted for inflation. 

(2)

Residential Zones 	2.20.050 
E. 	CPR1 Development Standards. The following standards shall apply to all development in the CPR1 zone: 
1. 
Lots with a slope of 25% or greater shall not be developed. Lots with a slope between 10% and 25% may be developed if the development incorporates specific measures to minimize grading and drainage systems which limit the rate of runoff, including siltation and erosion, to that which occurs naturally on the undeveloped site. 

2. 
Prior to the approval of a Coastal Development Permit, the applicant shall submit a runoff control plan designed by a licensed engineer qualified in hydrology and hydraulics, which would assure no increase in peak runoff rate from developed site over the greatest discharge expected from the existing undeveloped site as a result of a 100 year frequency storm.  Runoff control shall be accomplished by such means as on-site detention/desiltation basins or other devices.  Energy dissipating measures at the terminus of outflow drains shall be constructed.  The runoff control plan including supporting calculations shall be in accordance with the latest adopted City Standards and approved by the Public Works Director. 

3. 
All permanent erosion control devices shall be developed and installed prior to or concurrent with any on-site grading activities and shall be permanently maintained. Periodic monitoring of said devices shall be carried out by the City. 

4. 
All grading activities for roads, future building pads, utilities and installation of erosion and sedimentation devices shall be prohibited during September 30 through May 1. Prior to commencement of any grading activity, the applicant shall submit a grading schedule which indicates that grading will be completed within the permitted time frame designated in this condition and that any variation from the schedule shall be promptly reported to the Community Development Department. 

5. 
All areas disturbed by grading shall be planted prior to October 15th with temporary or permanent (as in the case of finished slopes) erosion control vegetation. Vegetative cover must be established by November 1 of each year. Said planting shall be accomplished under the supervision of a licensed landscape architect or landscape contractor and shall consist of seeding, mulching, fertilization and irrigation adequate to provide 90% coverage within 90 days. Planting shall be repeated if the required level of coverage is not established. This requirement shall apply to all disturbed soils including stockpiles, and to all building pads. 

6. 
Prior to approval of a Coastal Development Permit, a landscape plan shall be submitted in compliance with Section 3.30 (Landscaping Standards). 

7. 
Moderate Soil Limitations: Cut and fill slopes on areas under 20% slope shall not be over 4:1 slope and four feet high, compacted (if fill), with straw mulch broadcast and rolled at 3,000 pounds per acre, and seeded with a grass and native shrub seed mixture generally having the following basic ratio of components: 


City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012 Amended May 15, 2017, January 8, 2018, and May 21, 2018 

2.20.050 	Residential Zones 
Native woody shrubs--6 lbs/acre 
Native herbaceous annuals and perennials--15 lbs/acre 
Native grasses--60 lbs/acre 
Wood fiber mulch with soil binder--1,500 lbs/acre 
Fertilizer--150 lbs/acre 
Low Soil Limitations: Cut and fill slopes on areas under 10% slope shall not exceed 3:1 slope and four feet in height. Disturbed soil shall be hydroseeded (no straw mulch needed) with the seed mixture as recommended above, except additional wood fiber shall be incorporated at a minimum of 2,000 lbs/acre. 
8. 	
Temporary dust controls shall be employed during construction. Watering down methods used to control dust shall not erode the soil. Downhill cut or fill areas shall be lined with straw bales to control erosion from runoff. Where exposed soil conditions exist within the landscaped and irrigated portions of the sites near dwellings, slopes shall be planted with ground cover netting to retain soil. Plant materials shall be selected, sized and spaced to achieve total soil surface coverage in one year with irrigation provided. Trees and shrubs having fibrous root systems shall be used. Any of the mulch and seed mitigation measures described in Subsection 7 may be used instead of erosion control netting. 

9. 	
Multi-level construction designs should be used to reduce required grading. 

10. 
A combination of slopes and low retaining walls should be used to reduce grading. 

11. 
Pier or post and beam type construction should be used for sites in excess of 15 percent cross slope. Under structure areas shall be screened as required by the Review Authority. 

12. 
Areas of significant natural vegetation should be protected and enhanced where feasible. 

13. 
Native plant material shall be the major theme in all landscape designs. 

14. 
Roads, driveways, and structures shall be sited and designed to prevent impacts which would significantly degrade the adjacent environmentally sensitive area. 

15. 
Reasonable mitigation to protect Archaeological or Paleontological resources shall be required. 


F. 	Demolition of Residential Structures. Housing that provides living accommodations for low-and moderate-income households shall not be demolished, consistent with Housing Element Program 5.2.1, unless any of the following criteria apply: 
1. It is necessary to demolish the structure for health and safety reasons, as evidenced by the determination of the Building Official that it is substandard (in accordance with the criteria set forth in Chapter 10 of the Uniform Housing Code 
City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012 Amended May 15, 2017, January 8, 2018, and May 21, 2018 
Residential Zones 	2.20.060 
as amended from time to time) and the cost of remediating the code violations would: 
a. 	
Result in housing that is not affordable to low-and moderate-income 
households; or 


b. 
Exceed 50 percent of the assessed value of the structure in its present condition. 


2. 	
It is necessary to carry out a public project that would improve coastal access. 

3. 
The dwelling to be demolished is owner occupied. 

4. 
The dwelling to be demolished is a non-conforming use. 

5. 
The unit to be demolished shall be replaced with a rental unit available to low-or moderate-income households.

Figure 2.2 
D. 	Design Criteria for Second-Story Roof Deck Access. The access to and stairway design shall be an integral component of the structure and shall not be a dominant feature. 
E. 	Utilization and Furnishing of Second-Story Roof Deck. The intent of this Section is to limit the height of furnishings and utilization of the second-story roof deck.  It is also the intent of this Section to limit the possible obstruction of views from adjacent properties.  Therefore, furnishings shall not exceed the maximum height allowed in the zone. 
F. 	Lighting: Lighting for the second-story roof deck and its access shall be designed to prevent excess lighting from flooding onto adjoining properties. Prior to building permit issuance, the applicant shall provide a lighting plan to demonstrate compliance with the requirement. 
G. 	Required findings. The approval of the Development Permit for a second-story roof deck shall require the Review Authority make the following finding, in addition to those required for the Development Permit approval (Section 6.20.060) 
1. 
The project design will maintain privacy into the single story windows located in the adjoining side yard. 

2. 
The project design will maintain privacy into the adjoining rear yards.

3.10.010 Purpose & Applicability 
A. 	Purpose. This Chapter expands upon the zoning standards of Chapter 2 (Zones and Allowable Land Uses) by addressing additional details of site planning, project design, and the operation of land uses. The intent of these standards is to ensure that proposed development is compatible with existing and future development on neighboring properties, and produces an environment of desirable character, consistent with the General Plan. 
B. 	Applicability. The requirements of this Chapter shall apply to all proposed development and new land uses, except as specified in Section 7.40 (Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Lots), and shall be considered in combination with the standards for the applicable zone in Chapter 2 (Zones & Allowable Land Uses) and those in Chapter 4 (Standards for Specific Development and Land Uses). If there is a conflict between any standards, the provisions of Chapter 3 control over Chapter 2, and the provisions of Chapter 4 control over Chapters 2 and 3. Projects within the Coastal Zone shall comply with all standards in the Local Coastal Program. (Am. Ord. 14-04) 
3.10.020 Fences, Walls, and Screening 
A. 	Applicability. The requirements of this Section apply to all fences and walls unless otherwise stated. 
B. 	Height limits. Each fence or wall shall comply with the height limits shown in Table 3-1.

3.10.020 
Standards for All Development and Land Uses 
feet is 90% open and light emitting (e.g., wrought iron). 
2.	
  In non-residential zones, a solid fence or wall up to eight feet in height may be allowed for screening or security purposes subject to approval of an Administrative Development Permit.

3. 
All fences and walls shall comply with Section 3.10.030.E. (Restrictions to heightlimits at street corners) 


C. 	Measurement of fence and wall height. 
1. 	
Fence and/or wall height shall be measured as the vertical distance between the finished grade at the base of the fence and the top edge of the fence material. 

2. 	
In cases where elevation of the finished grade of the fence and/or wall differs from one side to the other (as when a fence is placed on top of a retaining wall), the height shall be measured from the side with the lowest natural grade; except that a safety fence with a maximum height of five feet shall be allowed in all cases. 



D. 	Specific fence and wall requirements. 
1. 	
Fencing between different land uses. Fencing between different land uses shall be provided in compliance with Subsection F. (Screening). 

2.

F. 	Screening. This Subsection establishes standards for the screening of non­residential uses when adjacent to residential zones at the lot boundary as follows: 
City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012 Amended December 3, 2018 Standards for All Development and Land Uses 
3.10.030 
1. 	
The screen shall consist of a solid, decorative wall of masonry or similar durable material, six feet in height. The Review Authority may require a wall up to eight feet in height if necessary to screen the use from the residential use. 

2. 	
The decorative wall shall be architecturally treated on both sides, subject to the approval of the Review Authority. 

3. 	
In industrial zones, a minimum of 10 feet of dense landscaping shall be planted adjacent to residential zones. 

4. 	
In commercial zones, a minimum of five feet of dense landscaping shall be planted adjacent to residential zones. 

5. 	
The Review Authority may waive or approve a substitute for the requirements of this Subsection if the Review Authority determines that: 

a. 	
The relationship of the proposed uses make the required screening unnecessary; 

b. 	
The intent of this Subsection can be successfully met by means of alternative screening methods; 

c. 	
Physical constraints on the site make the required screening infeasible; or 

d. 	
The physical characteristics of the site or adjoining lots make the required screening unnecessary. 




G. 	Mechanical equipment, loading docks, and refuse areas. 
1. 	
Roof or ground mounted mechanical equipment shall be screened from public view from adjoining public streets and adjoining areas zoned for residential uses. This equipment includes air conditioning, heating, ventilation ducts, and exhaust vents, loading docks, refuse storage areas, and utility services, electrical transformers, gas meters, etc. 

2. 	
The colors, materials, and architectural style of screening shall be architecturally compatible with other on-site development. 


3.10.030 Height Limits and Exceptions 
A. 	Purpose. This Section describes the required methods for measuring the height of structures in compliance with the height limits established by this Development Code, and exceptions and restrictions to those height limits. 
B. 	Maximum height of structures. The height of each structure shall not exceed the height limit established for the applicable zone by Article 2 (Zones and Allowable Land Uses), except as otherwise provided by this Section. 
C. 	Height measurement. The maximum allowable height shall be measured as the vertical distance from the average level of the highest and lowest point, measured from natural grade, of that portion of the lot covered by the building to the topmost 
City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012, Amended 2018 Amended December 3, 2018 
3.10.030 
Standards for All Development and Land Uses 
point of the roof as shown in Figure 3-2. Natural grade shall be determined by the Director using the best available information. 

D. 	Exceptions to height limits. The following structures and structural features may exceed the height limits of this Development Code as noted: 
1. 	
Architectural features. A chimney, cupola, monument, mechanical equipment, vent, or similar structure may exceed the height limit subject to approval of a Use Permit by the Review Authority; except a chimney or vent may exceed the maximum height of the applicable zone if required to meet Building Code requirements. 

2. 	
Telecommunications facilities. The height of telecommunications facilities, including antennas, poles, towers, and necessary mechanical appurtenances shall comply with Section 4.40 (Telecommunications Facilities). 


E. 	Restrictions to height limits at street corners. Development adjacent to any public or private street shall be designed to provide a traffic safety visibility area or sight triangle for pedestrian and traffic safety.  The restrictions to height limits are as follows: 
1. 	Uncontrolled intersections: At uncontrolled street intersections, a sight triangle shall be required in order to maintain visibility.  Such area shall consist of a triangular area with dimensions of 30 feet along the streets, measured at back of sidewalk as shown in Figure 3.3. Any solid wall, fence, building, or landscaping within this triangle may not exceed three feet in height. 
City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012 Amended December 3, 2018 Standards for All Development and Land Uses 
3.10.030 

2. 	Intersections with One or More Traffic Controls. 
a. 	
Applicability: The Sight Distance Triangle requirements are applicable to every intersection of two or more public streets within the City, where at least one of the directions of travel on any of those streets is not controlled by a stop sign or a traffic signal. 

b. 	
Standards and Guidelines: At street intersections, a sight triangle shall be required in order to maintain visibility. The dimensions required depend on several factors. The speed of the vehicles on the major road and the location of the vehicle attempting to enter the intersection from the minor road are the two main factors. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the grade of the roadways, the angles of view, height of the driver's eye, and whether or not curbside parking is allowed. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) has provided procedures and guidelines for resolving these issues in their publication, A Policy on Geometric Design of Highway and Streets  Latest Edition.  Intersections within the City shall comply with AASHTO recommendations insofar as the affected intersection areas shall be kept clear of all obstructions. All AASHTO guidelines shall be followed when feasible as determined by the City Engineer. 

c. 	
Approval Procedures: To ensure visibility, red curbing may be used to establish no parking zones related to the AASHTO guidelines. No parking shall be allowed along any red curbed frontage. Red curbing is also used to prohibit stopping at the curb for other purposes. Sight triangle examples are indicated in Figures 3.4 and 3.5.  No visual obstructions shall be permitted within the required sight triangle. Each intersection is different and exact requirements shall be established by the City Engineer. 

d. 	
Sight Triangle Examples: Generally, only two of the intersection types identified by AASHTO exist in the City. Both are Type "B", with stop control installed on the minor road.  The first type is a stop controlled intersection where the major road is multi-lane.  The second type is a stop controlled 


City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012, Amended 2018 Amended December 3, 2018 
3.10.030 
Standards for All Development and Land Uses 
intersection where both roads are single-lane, such as a typical residential intersection. All other intersections within the City are 4-way stop controlled or signalized. 

e. 	
This simplified example illustrates compliance with AASHTO recommendations.  The required sight triangle would consist of 70 feet to the left and 25 feet to the right. Each intersection is different and exact requirements shall be established by the City Engineer. 

f. 	
This simplified example illustrates compliance with AASHTO recommendations. The required sight triangle would consist of 35 feet to the left and 28 feet to the right. Each intersection is different and exact requirements shall be established by the City Engineer. 



City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012 Amended December 3, 2018 Standards for All Development and Land Uses 
3.10.040 
3.10.040 Outdoor Lighting 
A. 	Purpose.  The Section provides standards for outdoor lighting of non-residential uses to minimize light and glare on adjacent properties.  The intent of these standards is that outdoor lighting be limited to the minimum necessary for safety and security. 
B. 	Development standards.  New outdoor lighting on non-residential projects shall comply with the following requirements: 
1. 	
An outdoor light fixture shall be limited to a maximum height of 20 feet or the height of the nearest building, whichever is less. The Review Authority may approve a fixture in excess of 20 feet if it determines that the additional height will provide lighting that still complies with all other requirements of this Section. 

2. 	
Outdoor lighting shall utilize energy-efficient (high pressure sodium, low pressure sodium, hard-wired compact florescent, or other lighting technology that is of equal or greater energy efficiency) fixtures/lamps. 

3. 	
Lighting fixtures shall be shielded or recessed to minimize light bleed to adjoining properties, by ensuring that the light source (e.g., bulb, etc.) is not visible from off the site and confining glare and reflections within the boundaries of the site to the maximum extent feasible. 

4. 	
Each light fixture shall be directed downward and away from adjoining properties and public rights of-way, so that no on-site light fixture directly illuminates an area off the site. 

5. 	
In the Coastal Zone, all lighting shall be designed to protect against impacts to coastal resources, including biological and visual resources, as required by the Local Coastal Program. (Am. Ord. 14-04) 


3.10.050 Performance Standards 
A. 	Purpose. This Section provides performance standards that are intended to minimize various potential operational impacts of land uses and development within the City, and promote compatibility with adjoining areas and land uses. 
B. 	Applicability. The provisions of this Section apply to all new and existing land uses, including permanent and temporary uses in all zones, unless an exemption is specifically provided. Uses existing on the effective date of this Section shall not be altered or modified thereafter to conflict with these standards. 
C. 	Air emissions. No visible dust, gasses, or smoke shall be emitted, except as permitted by the San Luis Obispo Air Pollution Control District or as necessary for the heating or cooling of structures, and the operation of motor vehicles on the site. 
D. 	Combustibles and Explosives. The use, handling, storage and transportation of combustibles and explosive materials shall comply with the Citys Building and Fire codes, and all other applicable State and local regulations. 
City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012, Amended 2018 Amended December 3, 2018 
3.10.060 
Standards for All Development and Land Uses 
E. 	Dust. Activities that may generate dust emissions (e.g., construction, grading, commercial gardening, and similar operations) shall be conducted to limit the emissions beyond the site boundary to the maximum extent feasible. Appropriate methods of dust management shall include the following, subject to approval by the Public Works Director. 
F. 	Ground vibration. No ground vibration shall be generated that is perceptible without instruments by a reasonable person at the property lines of the site, except for vibrations from temporary construction or demolition activities, and motor vehicle operations. 
G. 	Liquid waste. No liquid shall be discharged into a public or private body of water, sewage system, watercourse, or into the ground, except in compliance with applicable regulations of the Regional Water Quality Control Board. 
H. 	Noise. All uses shall comply with the Citys noise standards in Municipal Code Article 
III. 
I. 	Odors. No obnoxious odor or fumes shall be emitted that are perceptible without instruments by a reasonable person at the property line of the site. 
J. 	Radioactivity, electrical disturbance or electromagnetic interference. None of the following shall be emitted: 
1. 	
Radioactivity, in a manner that does not comply with all applicable State and Federal regulations; or 

2. 	
Electrical disturbance or electromagnetic interference that interferes with normal radio or television reception or with the function of other electronic equipment beyond the property line of the site; or that does not comply with all applicable Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other applicable State and Federal regulations. 


3.10.060 Reasonable Accommodation 
A. 	Purpose 
1. 	
The Acts. This Section provides a procedure to request Reasonable Accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, the Federal Fair Housing Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (also known as the Acts) in the application of zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies, and procedures. 

2. 	
Adjustment to physical design standards. A Reasonable Accommodation is typically an adjustment to physical design standards (e.g., setbacks) to accommodate the placement of wheelchair ramps or other exterior modifications to a dwelling in response to the needs of a disabled resident. 


City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012 Amended December 3, 2018 Standards for All Development and Land Uses

3.40.090 
Mobile Home Park Conversion Process 
(ii) first month's rent, last month's rent and security deposit at the replacement mobile home park; (iii) differential between rental rates at the mobile home park being converted and the replacement mobile home park during the first year of relocation; and (iv) if necessary, the cost of purchasing an equivalent mobile home in the replacement mobile home park.

C. 	The conditions imposed in connection with approval of a conversion impact report shall not exceed the reasonable costs of relocation.  Conditions shall only be imposed in order to ensure that the Applicant adequately mitigates adverse impacts of the mobile home park conversion on affected mobile home owners and residents. In imposing conditions, the City shall interpret and apply this Chapter in a manner consistent with all applicable laws and shall not require cumulative forms of relocation assistance from the above options that result in costs to the applicant in excess of the reasonable costs of relocation in light of the circumstances of each affected resident or owner.

A. 	Any Applicant for change of use of a mobile home park may, simultaneous with such application, file an application for total or partial exemption from the obligation to provide relocation assistance. 
B. 	If such application is filed, notice of such application, with the information contained therein, and distribution thereof to the owners and residents of the mobile home park shall be provided with the application for change of use. 
C. 	Any such application shall establish that it is made on either or both of the following bases: 
1. 	That provision for relocation assistance would eliminate substantially all reasonable use or economic value of the property. Such basis may only be 
City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012 Amended December 3, 2018 Mobile Home Park Conversion Process 
3.40.090 
established if it is demonstrated that the imposition of such obligations would eliminate the reasonable use or economic value of the property for alternate uses, and that continued use of the property as a mobile home park would eliminate substantially all reasonable use or economic value of the property for reasons not caused or contributed by the park owner or Applicant. 
2. 	That a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in connection with a proceeding in bankruptcy that the closure or cessation of use of said property as a mobile home park is necessary, and that such court has taken further action which would prohibit or preclude payment of relocation assistance benefits, in whole or in part. 
D. 	Any such application made pursuant to Subsection (C)(1) shall contain, at a minimum, the following information: 
1. 	
Statements of profit and loss from the operations of the mobile home park for the most recent five-year period of the date of the application or request, certified by a certified public accountant.

2. 	
A statement to support the Applicant's assertion that continued use of the property as a mobile home park necessitates repairs or improvements or both, that are not the result of the park owner or Applicant's negligent failure to properly maintain the property, and that the costs thereof make continuation of the park economically infeasible. This statement must be made under penalty of perjury by a general contractor licensed as such pursuant to the laws of the State of California to certify that such contractor has thoroughly inspected the entire mobile home park; that such contractor has determined that certain repairs and improvements must be made to the park to maintain the park in decent, safe and sanitary condition, and that those certain repairs are not the result of the park owner or Applicant's negligent failure to properly maintain said property; the minimum period of time in which such improvements or repairs must be made; and itemized statement of such improvements and repairs; and the estimated cost thereof of repairs and improvements, if any, due to deferred maintenance separately identified. The Applicant shall also submit a statement verified by a certified public accountant as to the necessary increase in rental rates of mobile home spaces within the park within the next five years necessary to pay for such repairs or improvements that are not the result of the park owner or Applicant's negligent failure to properly maintain said property. If the Director requires an analysis of the information submitted by the general contractor, the Director may procure services of another such licensed general contractor to provide such written analysis, and the cost thereof shall be billed to and payment therefore shall be required from the Applicant. 

3. 	
The estimated total cost of relocation assistance which would otherwise be required to be provided pursuant to this chapter, which shall be based upon documented surveys, included with the application, of the available mobile home spaces within 25 miles of the mobile home park, residents of the park who are 


City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012, Amended 2018 Amended December 3, 2018 
3.40.0100 	Mobile Home Park Conversion Process 
willing to relocate and those who would elect to sell their mobile homes, and the value of the mobile homes in the park.

Such other information which the Applicant believes to be pertinent, or which may be required by the Director.

1. 
Where allowed. The uses that are subject to the standards in this Chapter shall be located only where allowed by Chapter 2 (Zones and Allowable Land Uses). 

2. 
Permit requirements.

D. 	Timing of construction. A second residential dwelling may be constructed simultaneously with, or after the primary residence. In addition, an existing residence that complies with the standards for a second residential dwelling in this Section may be considered a second residential dwelling, and a new primary residence constructed. 
E. 	Owner Occupied. Prior to building permit issuance, the property owner shall either sign a covenant to be recorded that requires the owner to occupy either the primary or second dwelling, or enter into an affordable housing agreement requiring that one of the dwellings be rented at the lower-income household.

The Affordable Housing Agreement may be rescinded if the owner agrees to record a covenant that one of the dwellings shall be owner occupied. 
F. 	Development standards: A second residential dwelling shall comply with all development standards of the zone, where such standards are considered on a cumulative basis with existing and proposed buildings, except for density and as provided in this Section. (Am. Ord. 14-04) 
1. 
Maximum Size. The maximum area for a detached second dwelling unit shall not exceed 1,000 square feet. The maximum area for a second dwelling unit attached to the primary residence shall not exceed 30 percent of the existing living area. 

2. 
Utilities. Water and sewer services shall be adequate to serve the second unit. 

3. 
Required Parking. In addition to the required parking for the primary dwelling, a second residential dwelling unit shall provide one parking space per bedroom, not to exceed two parking spaces. 

a.

4.10.180 Senior Housing 
A. 	Purpose: This Section provides flexible development standards to promote and encourage senior housing development where allowed by Chapter 2 (Zones and Allowable Land Uses). 
B. 	Development Standards: Residential development exclusively for seniors has operating characteristics which differ from those of typical multi-family dwellings. Therefore, the strict application of development standards may not be appropriate to apply to senior housing projects.  Accordingly, the Review Authority may approve exceptions to off-street parking, open space, and other development standards as may be appropriate if the findings in Subsection D can be made. Senior projects with affordable units are eligible for up to a 35 percent density bonus consistent with Government Code Section 65915.  The Council may consider a density bonus of up to 50 percent for a project that provides affordable units and is determined to be a superior design. 
C. 	Design standards. Senior housing shall provide adequate amenities (e.g., shopping, services, recreation, public transit, etc.) on-site or within close proximity. 
D. 	Required findings. The Review Authority may approve exceptions to the development standards of the applicable zone if the following findings can be made: 
1. 
The project provides a living environment that is conducive to seniors and will support their lifestyles. 

2. 
Exceptions to development standards would not create greater adverse impacts on surrounding properties than would be expected if the site was developed to its maximum intensity of the applicable zone.

The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 

2. 	
These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage.  The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses. 


C. 	Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of this Section to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide (i.e. mudlow) or flood related erosion areas.  These regulations are designed to: 
1. 	
Protect human life and health; 

2. 	
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly control projects; 

3. 	
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 

4. 	
Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 


City of Grover Beach Development Code  Adopted October 15, 2012 
Flood Hazard Area Use Control 	5.10.020 
5. 	
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 

6. 	
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 

7. 	
Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 

8. 	
Ensure that those who occupy the area of special flood hazard assume 
responsibility for their actions. 



D. 	Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.  In order to accomplish its purpose, this Section includes regulations to: 
1. 	
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 

2. 	
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 

3. 	
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 

4. 	
Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; 

5. 	
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012 
5.10.020 Flood Hazard Area Use Control 
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
Floodplain management regulations means this Section and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas.  This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.  
Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93. 
Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.  Also referred to as Regulatory Floodway." 
Floodway fringe is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "Regulatory Floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
Fraud and victimization as related to Subsection 5.10.060.C, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the Council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one-hundred years.  Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring.  In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water.  The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
Governing body is the City, which is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
Hardship as related to Subsection 5.10.060.C means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance.  The Council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved.  More economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional.  Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.  All of these problems can be 
City of Grover Beach Development Code  Adopted October 15, 2012 
Flood Hazard Area Use Control 	5.10.020 
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
Historic structure means any structure that is: 
1.

4. 	
Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 


Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see Basement definition).  
1. 	An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a buildings lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a. 	
The flood openings standard in Subsection 5.10.050.A.3.c; 

b. 	
The anchoring standards in Subsection 5.10.050.A.1; 

c.

In addition, the area of special flood hazards shall be expanded to include areas that are expected to be inundated by continued and accelerated sea level rise over the expected life of the development.  The area potentially subject to sea level rise shall be based upon up-to-date scientific papers and studies, agency guidance (such as the 2012 National Research Council report Sea-Level Rise for the Coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington: Past, Present, and Future) and reports by national and international groups such as the Intergovernmental Panel on climate Change. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at the City of Grover Beach Community Development Department, 154 South Eighth Street, Grover Beach, California. (Am. Ord. 14-04) 
C. 	Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this Section and other applicable regulations.  Violation of the requirements of this Section (including violations of conditions and safeguards) shall constitute a misdemeanor.  Nothing herein shall prevent the Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
D. 	Abrogation and greater restrictions. This Section is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.  However, where this Section and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
E. 	Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this Section, all provisions shall be: 
1. 	
Considered as minimum requirements; 

2. 	
Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 

3. 	
Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 


City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012 
5.10.040 	Flood Hazard Area Use Control 
F. 	Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this Section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.  Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.  Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes.  This Section does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.  This Section shall not create liability on the part of the City, any elected or appointed official, officer or employee thereof, the State of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Section or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
G. 	Severability.  This Section and the various Subsections thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any Subsection of this Section be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the Section as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the Subsection so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
5.10.040 Administration 
A. 	Designation of the floodplain administrator.  The Community Development Director in cooperation with the City Engineer is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this Section by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. 
B. 	Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
1. Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine: 
a. 	
Permit requirements of this Section have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage or existing structures; 

b. 	
All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 

c. 	
This site is reasonably safe from flooding; 

d. 	
The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated.  This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the City; and 

e. 	
All Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits.  Building Permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs).  Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the start of construction definition.

3. 

4. 


Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures. 
a. 	
Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings, develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining Market Value.  

b. 	
Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff. 


Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Subsection 5.10.030.B, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Article V of this Section. 
NOTE: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas  A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100­year) Flood Elevations dated July 1995. 
Notification of Other Agencies. 
a. 	Alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
(1) 
Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 

(2) 
Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency; and 


(3) 
Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 

b. 	
Base Flood Elevation changes due to physical alterations: 

(1) 
Within 6 months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). 

(2) 
All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits.  Building Permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the start of construction definition. 


Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
c. 	Changes in corporate boundaries: Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and 
City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012

g. 	
Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  


6. 	
Map Determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions.  The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Subsection 5.10.040.D. 

7. 	
Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this Section as specified in Subsection 5.10.030.C. 

8. 	
Biennial Report. Complete and submit Biennial Report to FEMA.

(b) Detached garages and accessory structures not meeting the above standards must be constructed in accordance with all applicable standards in Subsection 5.10.050.A. 
Crawlspace construction.  This Subsection applies to buildings with crawl spaces up to two feet below grade.  Below-grade crawl space construction in accordance with the requirements listed below will not be considered basements. 
(1) 
The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Crawl space construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a registered architect or professional engineer; 

(2) 
The crawl space is an enclosed area below the BFE and, as such, must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. For guidance on flood openings, see FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-93; 

(3) 
Crawl space construction is not permitted in V zones. Open pile or column foundations that withstand storm surge and wave forces are required in V zones; 

(4) 
Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation walls of the crawl space used to elevate the building, but also any joists, insulation, or other materials that extend below the BFE; and  

(5) 
Any building utility systems within the crawl space must be elevated above BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions. 

(6) 
Requirements for all below-grade crawl space construction, in addition to the above requirements, to include the following:

City of Grover Beach Development Code  Adopted October 15, 2012 
Flood Hazard Area Use Control 	5.10.050 
c. 	Meet the permit requirements of Subsection 5.10.040.C of this Section and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Subsection 5.10.050.D. 
2. 	Recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones V, and VE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map will meet the requirements of Subsection 
5.10.050.E.1 and Subsection 5.10.050.G. 
3. 	Owners of recreational vehicle parks and owners of manufactured home parks that allow placement of recreational vehicles must notify the Floodplain Administrator prior to placing any new recreational vehicle, altering any existing recreational vehicle, allowing the placement or alteration of, or allowing any recreational vehicle to remain on site for more than 180 consecutive days, such that the recreational vehicle fails to meet the requirements of Subsections 
5.10.050.E.1. a and b. The owner of a recreational vehicle that fails to meet the requirements of Subsections 5.10.050.E.1. a and b must apply for a city recreational vehicle permit and provide certification from an approved special inspector that the recreational vehicle complies with the requirements of Subsection 5.10.050.E.1.c and 5.10.050.E.2. 
4. 	The owner of the recreational vehicle subject to the permit requirements of Subsection 5.10.050.E.3 shall at the time of application for the permit, pay to the City a processing fee in an amount established by resolution of the Council. 
F. 	Floodways. Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
1. 	
Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than 1 foot at any point within the City. 

2. 	
Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the City shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 

3. 	
If Subsections 5.10.050.F.1 & 2 are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V. 


G. 	Coastal High Hazard Areas. Within coastal high hazard areas, Zones V, and VE, as established under Subsection 5.10.030.B, the following standards shall apply: 
1. 	All new residential and non-residential construction, including substantial improvement/damage, shall be elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns and securely anchored to such pilings or columns so that the bottom of 
City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012 
5.10.060 	Flood Hazard Area Use Control 
the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level.  The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components.  Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood.  Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or city building standards. 
2. 	
All new construction and other development shall be located on the landward side of the reach of mean high tide. 

3. 	
All new construction and substantial improvement shall have the space below the lowest floor free of obstructions or constructed with breakaway walls as defined in Article II of this Section.  Such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation and will be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. 

4. 	
Fill shall not be used for structural support of buildings. 

5. 	
Man-made alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage is prohibited. 

6. 	
The Floodplain Administrator shall obtain and maintain the following records: 

a. 	
Certification by a registered engineer or architect that a proposed structure complies with Subsection 5.10.050.G.1; and 

b. 	
The elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings or columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether such structures contain a basement. 




5.10.060 Variance Procedure 
A. 	Nature of variances. 
1. 	
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only.  Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. 

2. 	
The variance criteria set forth in this Subsection of this Section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature.  A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this Section would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners.  The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels.  The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.  

3. 	
The city should help protect its citizens from flooding.  This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are 


City of Grover Beach Development Code  Adopted October 15, 2012 
Flood Hazard Area Use Control 	5.10.060 
so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance must be quite rare.  The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited.  Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this Section are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
B. 	Conditions for variances. 
1. 	
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 5.10.040 and 5.10.050 have been fully considered.  As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 

2. 	
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 5.10.020) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 

3. 	
Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 

4. 	
Variance shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.  "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this Section.  For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the Commission need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the Commission believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.  

5. 	
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the Floodplain Administrator that: 

a. 	
The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage, and 

b. 	
Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the County of San Luis Obispo Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 




City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012 
5.10.060 	Flood Hazard Area Use Control 
6. 	The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
C. 	Appeal board. 
1. 	In passing upon requests for variances, the Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in this Section, and the: 
a. 	
Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 

b. 	
Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 

c. 	
Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;  

d. 	
Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;  

e. 	
Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 

f. 	
Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;  

g. 	
Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;  

h. 	
Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 

i. 	
Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;  

j. 	
Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and  

k. 	
Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 


2. 	Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
a. 	
Showing of good and sufficient cause; 

b. 	
Determine that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and 

c. 	
Determine that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see "Public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud and victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 


3. 	Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Subsections 5.10.060.C.1 through 
City of Grover Beach Development Code  Adopted October 15, 2012 
Flood Hazard Area Use Control 	5.10.060 
5.10.060.C.4 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
4. 	Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection 5.10.060.B.1 and the purposes of this Section, the Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Section.

i Living Area    1,000 Sq. Ft. X 1.00 = 1,000 Sq. Ft. Garage               400 Sq. Ft. X 0.25 =   100 Sq. Ft. Patio          100 Sq. Ft. X 0.15 = 15 Sq. Ft. Workshop 300 Sq. Ft. X 0.25 = 75 Sq. Ft. 

Total 	1,190 Sq. Ft. 
Proposed Improvements 

Addition: 	               450 Sq. Ft. X 1.00 = 450 Sq. Ft. 
Minus: Patio Removal  (100 Sq. Ft. X 0.15 =  15 Sq. Ft.)  
Adjusted Addition     	435 Sq. Ft. 
Percentage Calculation: 435 Sq. Ft. Addition / 1,190 Sq. Ft. Existing = 36.6% 
D. 	For projects consisting of more than one residential dwelling or any commercial remodel, the developer shall be required, in cases where the existing street condition is determined to be at a pavement condition less than 60 on the Pavement Management System (PMS) rating, to reconstruct the street to the centerline of the street, even though curb, gutter and sidewalk may already exist on the project frontage. 
City of Grover Beach Development Code  Adopted October 15, 2012 
Street Improvements 	5.20.020 
E. 	If existing curb, gutter or sidewalk is found to be in unsatisfactory condition fronting any commercial or multi-family project, then the applicant or developer shall be required to replace the defective portions of said improvements in accordance with City Standards. 
5.20.020 Timing 
In cases where this Section is applicable, the owner or person applying for such permit shall install curb, gutters, and sidewalks, as well as street conform, in accordance with Subsection 5.20.010.A along all streets abutting such property prior to the issuance of a certificate of final inspection on a Building Permit or other certificate of compliance with applicable permit conditions.  The owner or person installing curb, gutter and sidewalk shall also be required to construct a street conform per the City Engineer's requirements consistent with Subsection 5.20.010.A. 
5.20.030 Council Authority 
A. 	The Council may waive all or part of the requirements of this Section upon application for such waiver in cases where in the sole discretion of the Council the strict application of this Section would create substantial hardship, would be impractical, or would not be in the best interests of the City or the public. 
B. 	The Council may extend the time for compliance with the provisions of this Section and may require such cash or other bond as it deems suitable to guarantee compliance with this Section within such time limit as it may specify. 
C. 	No filing fee shall be required for the application to the Council under this Section. 
D. 	No improvements referred to in this Section shall be constructed until curb grades have been approved by the City. 
E. 	Each request for waiver of the requirements of this Section shall be acted upon independently by the Council based upon the particular facts involved. 
5.20.040 Street Conform 
A. 	As required by Subsection 5.20.010.A, the applicant or property owner shall install a street conform when new or replacement curb, gutter and sidewalk is required. In some cases these provisions apply even when curb, gutter and sidewalk may already exist. The street conform shall be designed and/or approved by the City Engineer at the property owner's expense. 
B. 	A street conform is that portion of new street built between the gutter lip that meets or conforms to existing paving in a safe manner.  The resulting slope between the new gutter lip and the existing street at the conform point is called the "cross fall".  A maximum safe cross fall shall not exceed ten percent and a usual cross fall will range from two percent to five percent as approved by the City Engineer. 
City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012 
5.20.050 	Street Improvements 
5.20.050 Extent of Street Conform 
The extent of the required street conform is dependent on the size and character of the project and the existing condition of the subject street(s).  The Pavement Management System (PMS) street rating (0-100) shall be used to determine the existing street condition. On corner lots, the requirements are applicable to both streets abutting the property. 
A. 	For projects consisting of one single-family dwelling: 
1. 	Pavements rated at 0-100 will require construction/reconstruction only to the conform point as approved by the City Engineer, or for up to the first 11 feet of width, whichever is less.  In the event that a conform wider than 11 feet is required, the City shall be responsible for that portion which is wider than 11 feet.  
B. 	For projects consisting of more than one single-family dwelling or any commercial development, including commercial remodels or additions: 
1. 	Pavements rated at 60-100, as verified by the City Engineer, will require construction/reconstruction only to the conform point as approved by the City Engineer. In some cases, the conform point could be all the way to the centerline of the street. If the Pavement Management System (PMS) street rating is 0-59, as verified by the City Engineer, then construction/reconstruction shall be required all the way to the centerline of the street regardless of the conform point.  These provisions apply even though curb, gutter, and sidewalk may already exist. 
C. 	For projects consisting of one single-family dwelling remodel or addition of 40% or more increase in floor area: 
1. 	Pavement shall be required to be constructed or reconstructed to the conform point, but not more than an average of four feet beyond the lip of gutter as approved by the City Engineer. The City shall be responsible for any part of the conform that is required to be wider than four feet. 
D. 	If a second single-family dwelling is constructed on the same parcel within two years after the completion of the first single-family dwelling, then that project shall be considered as more than one single-family dwelling and the provisions of this Section shall apply as to "more than one single-family dwelling".

A. 	The provisions of this Section shall apply to land uses, structures, and lots that were lawful before the adoption, or amendment of the Development Code, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted differently in compliance with the current terms of the Development Code. These situations are deemed to have legal nonconforming status. 
B. 	It is the intent of the Development Code to allow nonconforming uses to exist in compliance with the limited conditions outlined in this Section, but to discourage the long-term continuance of nonconformities. 
C. 	This Section does not regulate nonconforming signs, which are subject to the standards of Section 3.60 (Signs), or nonconforming parking, which is subject to the standards of Section 3.50.020 (Parking Regulations). 
7.40.020 Nonconforming Uses 
A. 	General. A nonconforming use may be continued, including through a transfer of ownership; provided that the use shall not be enlarged or increased, nor be extended to occupy a greater area of land or structure than it occupied before becoming nonconforming, except as provided in Subsections B, C, and D below and in Section

B. 	Nonconforming use.  A nonconforming use may be replaced with a similar use subject to approval of a Use Permit (Section 6.20.090).  The Review Authority shall find that the proposed use has similar or reduced impacts on surrounding properties and the same level of intensity or less intensive in terms of noise, traffic, parking demand, hours of operation, or other objectionable characteristics. If a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, no nonconforming use may be established thereafter.

2. 	
A nonconforming use may be expanded one time by up to 25 percent (measured in gross square footage occupied) through approval of a Use Permit (Section 6.20.090) provided the nonconforming use is not located west of Highway 1, that all off-site improvements, as identified by the City, are constructed by the applicant, in compliance with all City standards and the expansion is otherwise consistent with the Local Coastal Program. A nonconforming use shall not otherwise be expanded or enlarged unless required by law or by ordinance. (Am. Ord. 14-04) 


D. 	Alterations. A conforming structure used for a nonconforming use may be reconstructed or structurally altered up to 50 percent of its replacement cost.

7.40.040 Nonconforming Lots 
A. 	Legal building site. A nonconforming lot that does not comply with the applicable area, width, or depth standards of the Development Code shall be considered a legal building site if it meets at least one of the following criteria, as documented to the satisfaction of the Director: 
1. 	
Approved subdivision. The lot was created by a recorded subdivision; 

2. 	
Individual lot legally created by deed. The lot is under one ownership, was legally created by a recorded deed before the effective date of the amendment that made the lot nonconforming; or 


B. 	Nonconforming residential lots  
1. 	5,000 square foot lots. In any residential zone, lots legally created with minimum areas of 5,000 square feet, minimum widths of 50 feet, and minimum depths of 100 feet shall be considered "developable" lots requiring no additional permits other than required by this Development Code. 
a. 	Lots less than 5,000 square feet. In any residential zone, lots legally created with a minimum width of 25 feet and a minimum depth of 50 feet may be developed with a single-family dwelling, except that no Variances (Section 6.20.100) shall be approved. 
2. 	Contiguous Lot Merger Under Common Ownership.  The merger of a lot with an adjacent lot under common ownership, where one or both lots are substandard, shall be required in compliance with Government Code Section 66451.11.  
7.40.050 Loss of Nonconforming Status 
A. 	Termination by Abandonment. 
1. 	Nonconforming use. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a continuous period of 180 days or more in any zone except the Coastal Commercial zone, all rights to legal nonconforming status shall terminate. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a continuous period of one year or more in the Coastal Commercial zone, all rights to legal nonconforming status shall terminate.  The 
City of Grover Beach Development Code Adopted October 15, 2012 Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Lots 
7.40.060 
Director shall make a determination of discontinuance based on evidence such 

as the removal of equipment, furniture, machinery, inventory, structures, or other components of the nonconforming use, disconnected or discontinued utilities, or lack of business records to document continued operation. 
2. 	
Extensions of nonconforming uses or structures. An applicant can file an application for a Use Permit (Section 6.20.090) before the expiration of the abandonment period to extend the life of the nonconforming use. The Commission may approve a Use Permit to allow an extension, if the Commission finds that circumstances of a significant or unusual nature prevent or have prevented the timely reestablishment of the use or structure. 

3. 	
Termination. Once the rights to a legal nonconforming status have terminated, any further use of the site or structure shall comply with the current standards of the applicable zone and all other applicable provisions of the Development Code. 


B. 	Termination by destruction. Except as provided in Subsection 7.40.070.B (Reconstruction or replacement), nonconforming status shall terminate if more than 50 percent of the appraised value of the structure or use is destroyed.  In such case, the structure or use shall be rebuilt, restored, reestablished or reoccupied in conformance with the standards of the zone in which it is located, or be removed completely within 30 days of the occurrence of the damage or destruction. 
7.40.060 Nonconforming Due to Lack of Permit 
A use lawfully existing without the approval of a Use Permit or other discretionary development permit that would now otherwise be required in the zone shall be deemed conforming only to the extent of its previous lawful use (e.g., maintaining the same site area boundaries, hours of operation, etc.). 
7.40.070 Exceptions 
A. 	Interpretation. Applications for exceptions from the strict interpretation of this Section may be made to the Commission. The Commission shall hold a public hearing to consider the application for the exception and shall either approve the application with any appropriate conditions or deny the application. 
B. 	Reconstruction or replacement. A nonconforming structure involuntarily damaged or destroyed as a result of an accident or by an event outside of human control, such as an earthquake, fire, or flood, may be reconstructed or replaced with a new structure with the same footprint, height, and/or number of dwelling units with Use Permit approval and in compliance with current Building and Fire Code standards. 
C. 	Findings. The Commission may make exceptions in compliance with this Section only after making the following findings: 
City of Grover Beach Development Code  Adopted October 15, 2012 7.40.070 
Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Lots 
1. 	
That the structure was erected in compliance with the existing codes of the City which were in effect at the time that the structure was erected; and 

2. 	
That the granting of an exception will not substantially alter the intention of the existing zoning standards for the zone within which the structure is located.

8.10.010 Title 
This Chapter shall be known and cited as the Grover Beach Subdivision Ordinance.  
8.10.020 Purpose 
The regulations codified in this Title are adopted for the following purposes: 
A. 	To protect and provide for the public health, safety and general welfare; 
B. 	To guide the development of the City in accordance with the general plan and specific plans; 
C. 	To ensure that real property which is to be divided can be used without danger to inhabitants or property due to fire, flood, soil instability, noise or other hazard; 
D. 	To ensure that proper provision will be made for traffic circulation, public utilities, facilities, and other improvements within the subdivided land and within the City as a whole; 
E. 	To protect and enhance the value of land and improvements and to minimize conflicts among the uses of land and buildings; 
F. 	To protect potential buyers and inhabitants by establishing standards of design, and by establishing procedures which ensure proper legal description and monumenting of subdivided land; 
G. 	To protect the natural resources of the community, including topographic and geologic features, solar exposure, water courses, wildlife habitats and scenic vistas, and to increase reasonable public access to such resources; 
H. 	To enable innovations in subdivision procedures which facilitate development that will best reflect the capability of the land to support a desirable living environment.   
8.10.030 Adoption Authority  Conformance with Other Regulations 
A. 	These regulations are adopted pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act, as a "local 
City of Grover Beach Zoning Code  Adopted October 15, 2012 
8.10.040 	8.10 General Provisions 
ordinance" as that term is used in that act, and to supplement the provisions of that act. All provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and future amendments thereto not incorporated in these regulations shall apply to all subdivisions, subdivision maps and proceedings under these regulations. 
B. 	Nothing in this Section shall be read to limit the rights of the City to enact additional provisions concerning the division of land as are deemed necessary to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
C. 	Approval or conditional approval of a subdivision map shall not excuse compliance with other applicable provisions of this code or other applicable ordinances, rules, regulations and policies adopted by the City.   
D. 	Nothwithstanding anything to the contrary included in this chapter, all land divisions, lot line adjustments and mergers within the Coastal Zone shall require a Coastal Development Permit. For the purposes of this section, land divisions include: subdivisions through a parcel map, tract map, grant deed, or any other method; lot splits; redivisions of land; and issuance of a certificate of compliance, unless the certificate of compliance is issued for a land division that occurred prior to the effective date of the Coastal Act and complied with all State laws and local ordinances in effect at the time. (Am. Ord. 14-04) 
8.10.040 Interpretation and Application 
In their interpretation and application, these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare.   
8.10.050 Conflict with Public Provisions 
These regulations are not intended to annul any other law or regulation. Where any provision of these regulations imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these regulations or any other regulation or law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall control. 
8.10.060 Conflict with Private Provisions 
These regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction; provided, that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such easements, covenants, or any other private agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern. When the provisions of the easement, covenant or private agreement or restriction impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher standards than the requirements of these regulations or the determinations of the advisory agency or council in approving a subdivision or in enforcing these regulations, and such private provisions are not inconsistent with these regulations or determinations there under, then such private provisions shall be operative and supplemental to these 
City of Grover Beach Zoning Code Adopted October 15, 2012 
8.10 General Provisions 8.10.070 
regulations and determinations made there under.   

8.10.070 Actions by Persons with Interest 
When any provisions of the Subdivision Map Act or of these regulations require the execution of any certificate or affidavit or the performance of any act of a person in his official capacity who is also a subdivider or an agent or employee thereof, such certificate or affidavit shall be executed or such act shall be performed by some other person duly qualified therefore and designated so to act by the Council.   
8.10.080 Severability 
If any part or provisions of these regulations or application thereof to any person or circumstances are adjudged invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its operation to the part, provision or application directly involved in the controversy in which the judgment shall have been rendered and shall not affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the application thereof to other persons or circumstances. The council declares that it would have enacted the remainder of these regulations even without any such part, provision or application.

Tract Maps, Vesting Tentative Maps, and Parcel Maps: Procedures 
I. 	Extension of time to act. Any of the time limits for acting on tentative tract maps specified in these regulations may be extended by mutual consent of the subdivider and the Commission or Council, as the case may be. To do so, the subdivider must expressly waive, in writing or in the record at a public hearing, his right to have the map considered within those time limits.  
J.  	Application after denial.  When any application for a tentative tract map filed pursuant to this Chapter has been denied, no new application which is substantially the same shall be filed within one year of the date of denial unless the facts upon which the decision was made, have changed. The Community Development Director shall determine whether facts have changed or when an application is substantially the same as the previous application.   
K. 	Filing of final tract map.  Within 24 months of the date of approval or conditional approval of the tentative tract map, the subdivider may cause the boundary of the proposed subdivision or any part thereof to be surveyed and the required final tract map to be prepared and filed in accordance with these regulations and the Subdivision Map Act. When the final map is filed, either all survey markers shall be in place, or a bond shall be posted guaranteeing that all survey corners shall be placed prior to the acceptance of the public improvements by the Council.   
L. 	Termination of proceedings.  Failure to file a final tract map within 24 months of the date of approval or conditional approval of a tentative tract map, or within any extended period of time granted in accordance with Section 6.30.060, immediately following, shall terminate all proceedings. Before a final map may thereafter be filed, a new tentative tract map shall be submitted and approved hereunder.  
M. 	Time extension. 
1. 	
The Commission may extend the time for filing the final tract map for a period or periods not exceeding a total of three years. 

2. 	
Applications for extensions shall be made in writing prior to the date of tentative tract map expiration. Time extension may be granted subject to the condition that the final map shall be prepared and improvements shall be constructed and installed in compliance with requirements in effect at the time the request for extension is considered. Any other conditions may be imposed which may have been imposed at the time of tentative map approval and existing conditions may be revised or deleted or new conditions added.   


N. 	Final tract map compliance.  Final tract maps shall be prepared in accordance with the approved tentative tract map.   
O. 	Submission of final tract map.  When all the certificates appearing on the final tract map, except the approval certificates of the City Clerk, City Engineer, Community Development Director, the County Recorder's certificate, have been signed, and where necessary, acknowledged, the final tract map, along with copies of reference maps and other supporting data necessary to verify the survey, may be submitted to the City for examination and presentation to the Council for final approval, provided it complies with all other provisions of these regulations.

P. 	Action of City Engineer and Community Development Director. 
1. 	
Upon receipt of a final tract map and accompanying documents, fees and materials for filing, the City Engineer and Community Development Director shall determine if they are in substantial conformity with the approved or conditionally approved tentative tract map and modifications and conditions made or required. If they are found to be complete and in conformance with these and other applicable regulations, the Community Development Director shall transmit the map to the City Engineer who shall transmit the map to the City Clerk after certification. No map shall be certified until the required improvements have been installed or an agreement or bond for installation has been secured in accordance with these regulations. 

2. 	
Should the map or accompanying documents, fees or materials be found to be incomplete or incorrect in any respect, the City Engineer or Community Development Director shall advise the subdivider by mail of the changes or additions that must be made before the map may be certified. 

3. 	
If the City Engineer or Community Development Director determines circumstances concerning the design and improvement of the subdivision in relation to the public health, safety and welfare have materially changed since the approval of the tentative tract map, they need not certify the final map. In such instances, the City Engineer and Community Development Director shall return the map to the Council for further consideration. 

4. 	
The final tract map shall not be considered filed for action by the Council until the City Engineer and Community Development Director have completed the actions required in Subsections 1, 2 and 3 above.   


Q. 	Council action on final map.   
1. 	
At the meeting at which it receives the map, or at the first regular meeting thereafter, the Council shall approve the map if it conforms with the approved tentative map and meets the requirements of the Subdivision Map Act, these regulations, and any rulings made pursuant to them. If the map does not conform, the Council shall disapprove it. 

2. 	
If the Council fails to act within the prescribed time, the final map shall be deemed approved to the extent it meets the requirements enumerated above. Upon approval by either action or inaction, the City Clerk shall certify approval of the final map. 


R. 	Council acceptance or rejection of offers of dedication.  Subject to exceptions in the Subdivision Map Act, at the time the Council approves a final tract map, it shall also accept, accept subject to improvement, reject without prejudice, or reject all offers of dedication. This action shall be certified on the map by the City Clerk.

A. 	Application. 
1. 	
Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as implemented and supplemented by this Subdivision Ordinance, requires the filing of a tentative tract map or tentative parcel map, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed, in accordance with the provisions hereof. 

2. 	
If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by the Vesting Tentative Map Statute, the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to construction.   


B. 	Filing and processing. A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports, and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in the subdivision ordinance for a tentative map except as provided in Section 8.40.030. 
C. 	Council action on tentative tract map.  Within thirty days of its receipt of the Commissions report, the Council shall consider and approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the tentative tract map. If the map is disapproved, the grounds for disapproval shall be stated.   
D. 	Vesting on approval of vesting tentative map. 
1. 	
The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards described in Government Code Section 66474.2. However, if Section 66474.2 of the Government Code is repealed, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved. 

2. 	
Notwithstanding Subsection 1, a permit, approval, extension or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined: 

a. 	
A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both. 

b. 	
The condition or denial is required, in order to comply with state or federal law. 



3. 	
The rights referred to herein shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in Subsection G. If the final map is approved, these rights shall last for the following periods of time: 


a. 	An initial time period of one year. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase 
City of Grover Beach Zoning Code Adopted October 15, 2012 Tract Maps, Vesting Tentative Maps, and Parcel Maps: Procedures 
8.30.030 
is recorded. 

b. 
The initial time period 	set forth in Subsection (a) shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review, if such processing exceeds 30 days, from the date a complete application is filed. 

c. 	
A subdivider may apply to the Community Development Director for a one year extension at any time before the initial time period set forth in Subsection (a) expires. If the extension is denied, the subdivider may appeal that denial in compliance with Section 7.20 (Appeals). 

d. 
If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time specified in this Subsection, the rights referred to herein shall continue until the expiration of that permit, or any extension of that permit.  


E. 	Development inconsistent with zoning - denial or conditional approval.   
1. 	
Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with this Development Code in existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The City shall deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or his or her designee, obtaining the necessary change to this Development Code to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change to this Development Code is obtained, the conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall, notwithstanding Subsection 8.30.020.D, confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the change to this Development Code and the map, as approved. 

2. 	
The rights conferred by this Section shall be for the time periods set forth in Subsection 8.30.020.D.3.   


F. 	Applications inconsistent with current policy.  Notwithstanding any provision of this ordinance, a property owner or his or her designee may seek approvals or permits for development which depart from the ordinances, policies, and standards described in Subsections 8.30.020.D and E, and local agencies may grant these approvals or issue these permits to the extent that the departures are authorized under applicable law.   
G. 	Expiration.  The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall expire at the end of the same time period, and shall be subject to the same extensions, established by Subsection 8.30.010.M for the expiration of the approval or conditional approval of a tentative map.

8.70.150 - General requirement  Design Criteria and Improvement Standards 
8.70.160 - Improvements 
8.70.010 General Considerations 
The layout of streets and lots within a subdivision shall be consistent with the densities and types of uses authorized by the general plan, specific plans and zoning. The subdivision design shall also recognize the physical conditions of the site, such as slope, soil types, and adjacent land use, which may further limit uses of the property. The subdivider must simultaneously consider such factors as terrain, solar exposure, development objectives, and options available under these regulations in order to design a subdivision which best meets the needs of those who will occupy it as well as the community as a whole.   
8.70.020 General Requirements  Lots  
The design of lots should be based on intended use, topography and access requirements. Lots which are impractical for intended uses due to terrain, location of natural features, inadequate access, frontage, or buildable area, or other physical limitations will not be approved.   
8.70.030 Lot Dimensions 
Each lot shall have the minimum area and dimensions indicated in this Development Code for the zone in which it is located, unless otherwise increased by the provisions of this Chapter. Each lot shall front on a street, or approved ingress and egress easement.   
City of Grover Beach Zoning Code  Adopted October 15, 2012 8.70.040 
Subdivision Design and Improvements 
8.70.040 Solar Orientation 
The longest dimension of each lot should be oriented within thirty degrees of south, unless the subdivider demonstrates that for certain lots: 
A. 	The lots are large enough to allow proper building orientation and maximum feasible control of solar exposure by the lot owner, regardless of lot orientation; 
B. 	Buildings will be constructed as part of the subdivision project (as in condominium or planned development), and the buildings themselves will be properly oriented, with adequate solar exposure; 
C. 	Topography makes variations from the prescribed orientation desirable to reduce grading or tree removal or to take advantage of a setting which favors early morning or late afternoon exposure, or where topographical conditions make solar energy unfeasible; 
D. 	The size of the subdivision in relation to surrounding streets and lots precludes desirable lot orientation.   
8.70.050 Multiple Frontages 
Single family residential lots with frontage on more than one street are discouraged, except for corner lots or where topography makes a single frontage impractical. The City may require the release of access rights on one frontage which shall be noted on the subdivision map.   
8.70.060 Depth-Width Relationship 
Lots with a ratio of depth to width greater than three shall not be permitted unless there is adequate assurance that deep lot subdivision will not occur or that deep lot subdivision and subsequent development will be accomplished without detriment to adjacent properties.   
8.70.070 Lot Lines 
A. 	Lot lines should be at the top of slope banks. 
B. 	Side lot lines should be perpendicular to the street on straight streets, or radial to the street on curved streets, unless another angle would provide better building orientation for solar exposure or more lot area to the south of the likely building site, or unless another lot configuration would better suit the site topography or planned design of the development. 
C. 	On corner lots, the intersection lot lines adjacent to streets shall be rounded with a twenty-foot radius.

8.70.080 
8.70.080 Taxing District Boundary 
No lot shall be divided by a taxing district boundary.   
8.70.090 Flag Lots (deep lot subdivisions) 
A. 	Flag lots may be approved for subdividing deep lots subject to the following findings: 
1. 	
the subdivision is consistent with the character of the immediate neighborhood; 

2. 	
the installation of a standard street, either alone or in conjunction with neighboring properties is not feasible; and 

3. 	
the flag lot is justified by topographical conditions. 


B. 	Such subdivisions shall conform with the following: 
1. 	
The access way serving the flag lot(s) shall not be included in the determination of required lot area for any lot. 

2. 	
The original lot shall have frontage on a dedicated street of at least the minimum length required by these regulations for the zone in which it is located, plus the access way required to potential rear lots. 

3. 	
The access way to the rear shall be at least 20 feet wide (developed to City standards) for residential zones, except where the access way is more than 150 feet long, it shall be at least 24 feet wide with 20 feet of pavement. For all other zones, the access way shall be at least 30 feet wide with a paved roadway at least 24 feet wide. 

4. 	
Each lot shall have yards as required by this Development Code, including a 10 foot setback along any access way, whether easement or lot line. 

5. 	
The lot farthest from the street shall own the access way in fee. Other lots using the access way shall have an access and utility easement over it. 

6. 	
Lots utilizing the access way of a flag lot may be required to enter into a road maintenance agreement to insure perpetual maintenance and repair of the access way. 

7. 	
A reflectorized house number master sign shall be located at the intersection of the street and access way and individual reflectorized address signs shall be placed on the right hand side of the driveway to each individual lot.  


8.70.100 General Requirements  Streets  
The design of a subdivision street system should result from an evaluation of topographical conditions, the traffic likely to be generated by the types and numbers of planned uses, and the purpose of each street. The street system must allow an acceptable pattern of lots.  
City of Grover Beach Zoning Code  Adopted October 15, 2012 
8.70.110 
Subdivision Design and Improvements 
8.70.110 Access Restrictions 
Reserve strips of land to control access from adjoining property to public streets may be required by the City. Such reserve strips shall be at least one foot wide. They shall be shown and clearly labeled on the final map. Access restrictions may also be incorporated by note on the map.

Street names shall be of beach or resort origin or shall honor a non-living individual of historic significance to the community.   
8.70.130 Slope Easements 
Where excavation or fill slopes extend beyond the street right-of-way, easements for the slopes may be required by the City.   
8.70.140 Street Types and Requirements 
Requirements (i.e., travel lane width, right-of-way width, etc.) for various types of streets shall be as established by the City Engineer and Director of Public Works.  
8.70.150 General Requirement  Design Criteria and Improvement Standards 
The design criteria for subdivisions and the required physical improvements for them shall be in compliance with this Development Code, the City's grading ordinance, and other applicable regulations or standards.   
8.70.160 Improvements 
Improvement work, including grading, shall not be commenced until plans for all such work have been approved by the City Engineer. All improvements shall be constructed under the inspection of and to the satisfaction of the City. Improvements to be installed by the subdivider, in accordance with the subdivision standards established by the Public Works Department, include the following: 
A. 	Streets, curb, gutters, and sidewalks as required by the City Engineer.

Condominiums, community apartments and stock cooperatives provide for ownership of separate dwellings or equity coupled with a right of exclusive occupancy, as well as common areas within multiple-family housing normally managed and maintained by an owner's association. This mix of individual and common ownership and the potential problems of converting existing apartments make special regulations necessary.

These regulations are intended to: 
A. 	Establish requirements and procedures for the conversion of existing rental housing to residential condominiums and other forms of occupant housing. 
B. 	Provide for compliance with the Land Use Element and Housing Element of the City's General Plan. 
C. 	Assure purchasers of converted apartments are aware of the condition of the structure which is offered for purchase. 
D. 	Provide design and property improvement standards for condominium conversion projects. 
E. 	Maintain a healthy inventory of rental housing suitable for persons of low and moderate-income. 
8.130.020 Applicability of Other Laws 
All condominium projects shall be subject to all applicable provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and this Development Code, and all other applicable state and local laws and ordinances.   
8.130.030 Provisions to Govern Condominium Conversion Projects 
The procedures and standards contained in this Chapter shall govern condominium conversion projects.

The report shall include evidence that the internal walls would meet current sound attenuation standards and that all current energy conservation standards are met. In the event the noise and energy standards are not currently met, the report shall explain proposed corrective measures to be used. The report shall identify all defective or unsafe elements or those which may impair use and enjoyment of the property, and explain the proposed corrective measures to be used. The report shall be prepared by or under the supervision of a registered civil or structural engineer, licensed general contractor, or architect; 

2. 	
A report from a licensed pest-control operator describing in detail the presence and effects of any wood destroying organisms;
