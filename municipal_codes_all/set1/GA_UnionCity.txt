PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Union City of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1976 Code, as supplemented through January 1977, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1976 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-1 and the third section of Chapter 6 is 6-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 3-2 and 3-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-2.1, 3-2.2 and 3-2.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 11 and 12, it will be designated as Chapter 11.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Sonya Carter, City Administrator/Clerk and Mr. William McNally, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

The records of the city are public property and all these records contain information needed for varying lengths of time for the conduct of public business, and some of these records are essential for varying lengths of time for continuity of government or for the protection of the rights and privileges of our citizens. Some of these records contain information that is important as documentary evidence of our heritage and will be treasured by future generations as priceless historical research material. It is in the best interests of our citizens that an efficient and cost effective records management plan be adopted and implemented which will cause any records whose usefulness has ended to be destroyed and which will cause those records which have enduring value to be identified and preserved. 
(b)  The city clerk, is responsible for records management activities and is directed to act for and in behalf of the mayor and council in directing and coordinating all records management matters. 
(c)  No record shall be destroyed except in accordance with approved retention schedules. 
(d)  Whenever any records are destroyed, a certificate of destruction shall be prepared and forwarded to the mayor and council which shall show the type of records destroyed, the approved retention schedule number, the dates covered, and the volume destroyed.

Sec. 2-94. - Employee drug policy. 
(a)  Purpose. The mayor and council finds that the manufacture, distribution, sale, use, or possession of controlled substances, marijuana, and other dangerous drugs in an unlawful manner is a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare. The mayor and council further finds that the use of alcohol during or prior to working hours is prohibited where alcohol can be measured at the level of .02 grams during working hours, said level being presumptively adverse to the safety of the workplace. It is declared to be a primary purpose and goal of this city, and of all of its public officials and employees to take all reasonable steps possible to eradicate the unlawful manufacture, distribution, sale, use, and possession of controlled substances, marijuana, and other dangerous drugs; and further to take all reasonable steps to eradicate the use of alcohol where a level of .02 grams exists, such level adversely affecting the safety of the workplace. With this purpose in mind, the mayor and council declares that its work force must be absolutely free of any person who would knowingly manufacture, distribute, sell, use, or possess a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug in an unlawful manner; and from any person whose use of alcohol results in a level of .02 grams during working hours. For this reason, and pursuant to Chapter 23 of Title 45 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, the mayor and council enacts this section. 
(b)  Definitions. As used in this section the term: 
    City means Union City, Georgia. 
    City employee means any person employed by the city. 
    Controlled substance means any drug, substance, or immediate precursor included in Schedules I through V of O.C.G.A. sections 16-13-25 through 16-13-29 and Schedules I through V of 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1308. 
    Convicted or conviction refers to a final conviction in a court of competent jurisdiction or the acceptance of a plea of guilty. 
    Criminal drug statute means any criminal statute involving the manufacture, sale, distribution, dispensation, use, or possession of any controlled substance or marijuana.

    Safety sensitive employees means all employees of Union City with the exception of the following positions: Cashier clerk; accounts technician; permit/tax/license technician; accounts payable technician; receptionist; part-time court clerk assistant; and part-time records clerk. 
    Under the influence of drugs/alcohol means testing positive for the presence of illegal drugs or a blood alcohol test result of .02 grams or more. 
(c)  Violation. It shall be a violation of this policy for any city employee to be under the influence of a controlled substance or alcohol while on the work premises or elsewhere as a result of job requirements during working hours while the employee is at work. Any city employee in possession of, selling, distributing, trafficking or manufacturing any controlled substance shall be in violation of this policy. 
(d)  Prescription drugs. Any city employee under his/her doctor's orders to take prescription medication, and who is requested to undergo drug testing, shall notify his/her immediate supervisor, prior to the testing, if that employee is currently taking the prescribed medication. Any person who has been offered employment with the city in a position that has been designated as high risk, and is under his/her doctor's orders to take prescription medication, and is currently taking the prescribed medication, shall notify the human resources director, prior to the mandatory preemployment testing. 
(e)  Random drug testing. Due to the potential serious consequences of a city employee attempting to perform his/her job functions while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, all safety sensitive city employees are subject to random drug/alcohol testing. Nonsensitive city employees, as listed in (a) above, under the definition for "safety sensitive employees", may also volunteer to participate in the random drug testing. Volunteer participation in the random drug testing may be accomplished by the nonsensitive employee submitting a signed and notarized certificate to their department head, who will approve the voluntary participation in writing and forward the completed certificate to the human resources director for enclosure in the employee's personnel folder. All persons who have been offered employment with the city must undergo drug/alcohol testing as a precondition to employment. All employees are subject to the same disciplinary measures contained in this article for their refusal to undergo the testing. 
(f)  Reasonable suspicion. Any city employee who demonstrates an unexplained inability to perform his/her normal job functions safely or productively, and/or exhibits characteristics consistent with the use of a controlled substance or alcohol (e.g., slurred speech, unsteady gait, etc.) will be required to undergo a drug/alcohol test to determine whether or not a violation of this policy has occurred. Whenever any supervisor detects any evidence of alcohol, drugs or controlled substances in the work place, such evidence shall constitute reasonable suspicion that an employee is in violation of this policy. 
(g)  Procedures for reasonable suspicion drug/alcohol testing. Any supervisor who has reason to believe an employee is under the influence of drugs/alcohol, in a nonemergency situation, shall contact the city administrator, or his/her designee, to obtain approval prior to requesting the employee to undergo the testing. In a nonemergency situation, one (1) or more additional supervisors shall observe the employee to corroborate that reasonable suspicion exists warranting a drug/alcohol test. 
    The employee shall be requested by the supervisor to undergo a drug/alcohol test. If the employee should refuse to submit to the testing, disciplinary measures shall be taken against the employee, ranging from a minimum five-day suspension from work without pay up to and including termination, for refusing to submit to the testing and for insubordination. The next time a supervisor requests the employee to undergo a drug/alcohol test based upon the supervisor's suspicion that the employee is under the influence of drugs/alcohol, if the employee should refuse to submit to the testing the employee will be terminated. 
    The employee, after consenting to the testing, shall be transported by the city to the testing facility. Following the test, the employee shall be suspended with pay pending an investigation and the test results. If the test results are positive, the employee will be afforded an opportunity to explain.

Sec. 3-297. - Nudity restricted. 
(a)  Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; Dekalb County, Georgia; Smyrna, Georgia; and Richmond County, Georgia; which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by Union City, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among general comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of this council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars," or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this section is hereby adopted. 
(b)  The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve, or dispense alcoholic beverages for consumption on such premises within the city limits of Union City: 
(1)  The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume, or clothing, as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or of any portion of the male or female pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva and genitals. 
(2)  Live entertainment where any person appears in the manner described in paragraph (1) of this section or where such persons (or person) perform(s) acts of, or acts which simulate any of the following: 
a.  Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, or any sexual act which is prohibited by law; 
b.  The caressing or fondling of the breasts, buttocks, anus or genitals; 
c.  The displaying of the male or female pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals. 
(3)  The holding, promotion, sponsoring or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night, event or any other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the conduct described in paragraphs (1) and (2) above; provided, however, that nothing contained in this section (b) shall apply to the premises of any mainstream performance house, museum or theater which derives less than twenty (20) percent of its gross annual income from the sale of alcoholic beverages. 
(c)  It is hereby declared to be the intention of the mayor and council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this enactment are severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section hereof shall be declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any Court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this enactment, since the same would have been enacted by the mayor and council without the incorporation herein of any such unconstitutional phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section. 
(d)  All ordinances and parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.

Sec. 3-381. - Nudity restricted. 
(a)  Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; Dekalb County, Georgia; Smyrna, Georgia; and Richmond County, Georgia; which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by Union City, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among general comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of this council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars," or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this section is hereby adopted. 
(b)  The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve, or dispense alcoholic beverages for consumption on such premises within the city limits of Union City: 
(1)  The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume, or clothing, as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or of any portion of the male or female pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva and genitals. 
(2)  Live entertainment where any person appears in the manner described in paragraph (1) of this section or where such persons (or person) perform(s) acts of, or acts which simulate any of the following: 
a.  Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, or any sexual act which is prohibited by law; 
b.  The caressing or fondling of the breasts, buttocks, anus or genitals;

Sec. 8-4. - Nuisances. 
(a)  Defined. A "nuisance" in general terms shall be construed to mean anything that causes hurt, inconvenience or damage to another, and the fact that the act done may otherwise be legal does not keep it from being a nuisance. The consequences complained of must not be fanciful or such as would only affect a person of fastidious tastes, but it must be such as would affect an ordinary, reasonable person. "Nuisance" as defined in this section shall be in addition to any and all other definitions of nuisances contained in the ordinances of the city. 
(b)  Authority to abate. The city court shall have full power to order the abatement of any nuisance, whether public or private, within the city, and the chief of police or other police officers of the city, or the sheriff of the county or his deputies, shall have full power and authority to execute the court's order. 
(c)  Complaint, notice of hearing. When any nuisance exists in the city, any person affected thereby may apply or complain to the city court or the chief of police for abatement thereof, and it shall be the duty of the court or of the chief of police to cause reasonable notice of not less than four (4) days, to the parties interested, of the time and place of hearing. The complaint shall be in writing, shall specify the acts or thing complained of, and shall be signed by the person or persons seeking the abatement. Notice of the hearing shall be in writing, shall be served upon the parties interested by the police department, and shall reasonably specify the nuisance sought to be abated. The service may be personal or may be accomplished by leaving the notice at the residences of the parties interested. 
(d)  Order to abate; execution for costs. When any person shall be convicted of creating or maintaining a nuisance, he shall be ordered to abate such nuisance within a reasonable time to be fixed by the court, and should such person fail or refuse to abide by the court's order, it shall be the duty of the chief of police and the other police officers of the city to abate the same at the cost of the defendant. In any instance of failure or refusal to abate a nuisance after ordered to do so by the city court, and the abatement thereof by the police department, the cost thereof shall be collected by execution, levy and sale as in cases of taxes due the city. 
(e)  Issuance of execution. The execution provided for in subsection (d) above shall be issued by the city clerk when the chief of police shall make affidavit stating the reasonable cost of abating the nuisance, and the execution shall issue for the reasonable cost or expense as shown by such affidavit.

ARTICLE IX. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES 

Sec. 9-220. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  It is the purpose of this ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Union City, hereinafter, the "city", and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor the effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor the effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
(b)  Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the Mayor and Council, and on studies in other communities including but not limited to the Analysis of the Relationships Between Adult Entertainment Establishments, Crime, and Housing Values performed by the Minnesota Crime Prevention Center, Inc., October, 1980; the experience of the Cities of College Park, Forest Park, Marietta, and Smyrna, the mayor and council finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary, unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. The commercial exploitation of human sexuality, in all forms in which such exploitation may be manifested has a deleterious effect on the community where it takes place as heretofore mentioned and that such effects are intensified and exacerbated when such is provided in conjunction with the service or consumption of alcohol. Sexually oriented businesses cause an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas, including but not limited to disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. 
(2)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
(3)  Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. Further, such establishments escalate undesirable community conditions, including blight, diminished property values, and cause increases in the need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources, and increases in the burden on the judicial system as a result of the criminal behavior which the mayor and council finds such business establishments bring to a community. The negative effects such businesses cause are not limited to such facilities that offer live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts but that other forms of sexually oriented businesses also have deleterious effect on nearby neighborhoods, commercial districts and on urban life in general. These other types of such businesses include but are not limited to adult bookstores, peep shows, massage parlors, bathhouses, adult gift and novelty shops, and lingerie or nude modeling studios. 
(4)  Communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses. AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components. 
(5)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities there are unhealthy, and in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(6)  The findings noted in paragraphs (1) through (5) raise substantial governmental concerns. Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(7)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(8)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult entertainment establishments. 
(9)  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(10)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(11)  The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article.

Sec. 10-25. - Loitering for purpose of procuring others to engage in sexual acts for hire. 
(a)  Legislative findings and intent. 
(1)  The mayor and council finds that sex acts for hire are inherently exploitative, endanger the health, safety and welfare of the participants and citizens in general, affect property values, and are an affront to the dignity of our citizens. These exploitative acts adversely affect a property or area in which they occur and lead to the avoidance of such places by law-abiding citizens, increased opportunity for unlawful criminal activities, and further decay of neighborhoods. 
(2)  The City has a strong interest: (i) in ensuring that citizens feel safe in their neighborhoods; (ii) in protecting the health of its citizens; (iii) in safeguarding the economic vitality of its business districts; and (iv) in preserving peace and order in public places to enable them to be used for their intended purpose. 
(3)  The mayor and council find that loitering for the purpose of procuring others to engage in sex acts for hire usually includes a power imbalance between those seeking to purchase the sexual services and those being exploited to perform the sex acts, with the persons procuring the sexual services tending to be more economically and socially advantaged than the people who would provide the sex acts. A person seeking to purchase the sexual services bears a greater responsibility for the transaction than does the person being prostituted. Furthermore, it is widely acknowledged by criminal justice experts that holding purchasers, or "johns," principally accountable for these sex acts for hire is the most effective method available to reduce the incidence of prostitution in an area. 
(4)  This section is not intended to limit any person from exercising the right to assemble or engage in any constitutionally protected activity. This section applies to all persons with the requisite intent to induce another to engage in sex acts for hire. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter, as defined in section 10-64, in or near any thoroughfare or place open to the public in a manner and under circumstances manifesting the purpose of inducing, enticing, soliciting, pandering or procuring another to commit a sexual act for hire. 
(c)  A law enforcement officer who observes a person loitering under circumstances that provide the officer with an articulable suspicion to believe a sexual act for hire has occurred or is occurring may detain the individual for the purpose of investigating whether the person is in violation of this section. 
(d)  A law enforcement officer may detain an individual under this section if an element from subsection (1) and an element from subsection (2) or both elements from subsection (3) below are satisfied: 
(1)  The person engages in one (1) or more of the following behaviors: 
a.  Repeatedly circling the block in a motor vehicle; 
b.  Stopping a motor vehicle in a public roadway to beckon to, stop, or engage with persons on the side of the road; 
c.  Repeatedly stopping or attempting to stop motor vehicle operators by hailing, waiving of arms or any bodily gesture; or 
d.  Driving around or sitting in a parked car in a parking lot or vacant lot. 
(2)  One (1) of the following factors applies: 
a.  The officer has knowledge of a specific reliable tip concerning unlawful prostitution-related activity at a specific location, and the person who is found loitering is doing so at a time, in a place or in a manner that is otherwise consistent with the details provided in the tip; 
b.  The person is loitering in an area that is known to be a common location for prostitution-related activity; 
c.  The person is on the premises of a hotel or other business that is associated with an advertisement for prostitution-related activity; 
d.  The person is a non-resident of the area and is present in the area outside of normal business hours and without legitimate business in the area; 
e.  The officer knows that the person has been previously convicted of loitering with the intention of procuring others to engage in sexual acts for hire under this section; or 
f.  Any vehicle the person has approached or communicated through is registered to an individual who has been convicted of an unlawful prostitution-related activity in the previous three (3) years, and the officer is aware of that fact. 
(3)  a.  The person enters or is present in a hotel room that is not registered to said person; and 
b.  The person is on the premises of a hotel that is associated with an advertisement for prostitution-related activity. 
(e)  For purposes of this section "sexual act for hire" means conduct which constitutes an offense defined in O.C.G.A. Tit. 16, Ch. 6, as amended; conduct which constitutes complicity to commit such an offense; or conduct which constitutes conspiracy to commit such an offense. 
(f)  Any person in violation of this section shall be guilty of the offense of loitering for the purpose of committing a sexual act for hire.

Sec. 10-56. - Alarm system permits; false alarms. 
(a)  Application for permits. Any property owner or lessee of property in the City of Union City having or installing on his or her premises an alarm system which is designed to directly contact the Union City Department of Public Safety (Police or Fire) shall apply to the licensing authority for a permit to have such a device on his or her premises. Application for permits for alarm systems which are designed to directly contact the Union City Department of Public Safety (Police or Fire) existing on premises on the effective date of this section must be made to the licensing authority within thirty (30) days. Application for renewal permits must be submitted annually thereafter. No such alarm system may be installed on the premises of the owner or lessee after the effective date of this section prior to the licensing authority having issued a permit to such owner or lessee.

(b)  Permit fees. The annual permit fee for an alarm system designed to directly contact the Union City Department of Public Safety (Police or Fire) shall be fifty dollars ($50.00). 
(c)  False alarm. This subsection is intended to cover the activation of a signal from an alarm system which elicits a response from the police or fire and rescue department when there is in fact no emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity necessitating such a response. This definition includes, without being limited to, any alarm system signal activated as a result of weather, negligence, accident, mechanical failure, electrical failure, electrical surge, signals activated intentionally in non-emergency situations and signals activated where the actual cause of such activation is unknown. There is a rebuttable presumption that an activated alarm system signal is a false alarm if the responding personnel, after following normal procedures in their response and investigation, find no evidence of unauthorized entry, criminal activity or other emergency. An activated alarm system signal shall not be considered a false alarm if: 
(1)  The police or fire and rescue department is notified to cancel its response by the alarm user or the alarm user's monitoring agent prior to the time emergency personnel arrive at the premises; 
(2)  The alarm system signal was intentionally activated by an individual based upon a reasonable belief that an emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity requiring immediate response existed; or 
(3)  The alarm system signal was activated by lightning or other acts of nature resulting in an electrical surge which causes physical damage to the alarm system evidenced by the written report of a licensed alarm system contractor who conducted an inspection of the system at the premises and personally observed such physical damage. 
(d)  [Residential false alarm response.] For each police or fire response to a false alarm at a residence, a responding officer shall issue the following: 
(1)  For the first three (3) false alarms within a calendar year, no citation shall be issued, but the resident or property owner shall be issued a warning notice; 
(2)  For the fourth and fifth false alarm within a calendar year, the resident or property owner shall be issued a municipal court citation and the minimum fine shall be fifty dollars ($50.00) per citation; 
(3)  For the sixth false alarm within a calendar year, the resident or property owner shall be issued a municipal court citation and the minimum fine shall be one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per citation; and 
(4)  For the seventh and subsequent false alarms within a calendar year, the resident or property owner shall be issued a municipal court citation and the fine shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per citation. 
(e)  [Commercial false alarm response.] For each police or fire response to a false alarm at a commercial establishment, a responding officer shall issue the following: 
(1)  For the first three (3) false alarms within a calendar year, no citation shall be issued, but the business owner or his/her agent shall be issued a warning notice; 
(2)  For the fourth and fifth false alarm within a calendar year, the business owner or his/her agent shall be issued a municipal court citation and the minimum fine shall be five hundred dollars ($500.00) per citation; and 
(3)  For the sixth and subsequent false alarms within a calendar year, the business owner or his/her agent shall be issued a municipal court citation and the fine shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per citation. 
Should any municipal court fine go unpaid, the city shall withhold the issuance of an occupation tax certificate until all fines are paid to the municipal court. 
(f)  Renewal. All holders of alarm system permits must tender an annual permit fee to the licensing authority on or before January 1 of each year. 
(g)  Connection. No one may connect an alarm system to directly notify the Union City Department of Public Safety (police or fire) without first obtaining an alarm system permit. All costs incurred in such hookup shall be borne by the permittee. No one may place, install, or otherwise locate, or cause to be placed, installed, or otherwise located, any central station equipment for direct connection of alarm systems within the Union City Department of Public Safety (police or fire) without the prior consent of the Union City Department of Public Safety (police or fire). Upon suspension, revocation, or termination of such permit, the owner or lessee, as the case may be, shall immediately disconnect, or immediately cause to be disconnected, the alarm system. 
(h)  Alarm system description. The permittee must possess a written description of the function and operation of the alarm system installed on the premises, along with the procedure and means for activating or deactivating the same. 
(i)  Individual requirement. Every permittee shall furnish to the Union City Department of Public Safety (police or fire) the name and telephone number of the primary individual responsible for the alarm system and at least one (1) alternate name and telephone number of an individual who can deactivate the alarm system or systems. The permittee will be responsible for deactivating the alarm system within a reasonable time following notification by the Union City Department of Public Safety (police or fire).

Sec. 10-62. - Liability of the city. 
    The city shall take every reasonable precaution to assure that alarm systems and alarm messages received by the communications center are given appropriate attention and are acted upon with dispatch. Nevertheless, the city shall not be liable for any defect in operation of automatic devices and signal line systems, for any failure or neglect to respond appropriately upon receipt of an alarm from such a source, nor the failure or neglect of any person or agency providing dispatch or monitoring services to properly notify the city or its communications center as a result of failure in the connection with the installation and operation of equipment, the transmission of alarm signals and alarm messages, or the relaying of any such signals or messages to the communications center.

(Ord. No. 2004-18, § 1, 9-21-04; Ord. No. 2011-16, §§ 2-5, 10-18-11; Ord. No. 2014-02, § 1, 3-18-14) 
Sec. 11-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sediment control measures. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sediment control plans. Soil erosion and sediment control measures and practices shall conform to the requirements of subsections 11-34(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installation drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sediment pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 11-34(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with section 11-34(b)(2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f). As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Georgia; specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the Division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land-disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion. 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum. 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential. 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented. 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum. 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable. 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development. 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures must be installed as soon as practicable. 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills. 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property. 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners. 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts, except when such methods are not feasible and provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum. 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments onsite or preclude sedimentation of adjacent streams beyond the levels specified in section 11-34(b)(2) of this article. 
(15)  Except as provided in subsections (16) and (17) of this section, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all stale waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implement; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events, that has a channel located above the groundwater table year-round, for which groundwater is not a source of water, and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be construed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; causing a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented as: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(17)  There is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970," and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph, maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time alter damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a twenty-five-foot buffer would consume at least eighteen (18) percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than five hundred (500) square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r) of the Rules of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than five thousand (5,000) square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities. 
(d)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 11-34(b) and (c) of this article. 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for a project for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2004-18, § 1, 9-21-04; Ord. No. 2010-11B, § 7, 6-15-10; Ord. No. 2011-16, § 6, 10-18-11; Ord. No. 2018-10 , §§ 2, 3, 11-20-18) 
Sec. 11-35. - Application process. 
(a)  General. 
(1)  The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, this article, and other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdiction boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(2)  Wetlands as defined in 33 CFR Part 328.3(b) are an important resource, which are protected through the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended. This Act regulates all dredge and fill activities in waters of the U.S. and is aadministered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Land disturbing activities may require a Section 404 permit administered by the Army Corps of Engineers. The United States Department of Interior has prepared a national wetlands inventory map covering the City of Union City. The map is known as the Fairburn, Georgia National Wetlands Inventory Map (2-ATL-E5) and is incorporated in this article by reference. To assist applicants for land disturbance permits, the city has available for public inspection a copy of the Fairburn National Wetlands inventory map. It is encouraged that permit applicants for land disturbance use this map as a resource to identify wetlands. Permit applicants are cautioned, however, that all wetlands may not be identified by this map and the responsibility for defining wetlands and securing any necessary state or federal permits rests solely with the applicant. Applicants for land disturbance permits are advised that only the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for certifying whether or not wetlands are present on the site, the city is not involved with Section 404 permitting. As a part of the process of obtaining a land disturbance permit, all applicants must complete and submit an "acknowledgment and certification" form provided by the city which acknowledges the applicant has investigated Section 404 permitting criteria and has determined whether or not the permit is required for the project for which a land disturbance permit has been requested. Should the applicant certify a Section 404 permit is not required, the city make a determination from the map as to whether or not the presence of wetlands is likely within the area in which the permit is requested. Should the city determine that the presence of wetlands is likely in the area the city may not issue the land disturbance permit. A determination by the city that the presence of wetlands is likely in the area requires the applicant obtain a determination made by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If wetlands are present, the applicant must obtain a Section 404 permit prior to being issued a land disturbance permit. Should the applicant certify a Section 404 permit is required, the city may not issue a land disturbance permit until the applicant provides a copy of the Section 404 permit to the city. Any action by the city under this article does not relieve the property owner, developer, or petitioner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Union City without first obtaining a land disturbance permit from the issuing authority to perform such activity and providing a copy of the notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the issuing authority and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, at a minimum, the data specified in subsection 11-35(c) of this article. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of subsections 11-34(b) and (c) of this article. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five (5) copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
(3)  A fee shall be charged for each application as determined by the mayor and council for the City of Union City. The fee shall be based on each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
(4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land-disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority. 
(5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. no permit shall be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 11-34(c)(15) and (16) and bonding, if required as per subsection 11-35(b)(7) have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(6)  If a permit applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three (3) years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(7)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to cash, cashier's check or money order up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with the ordinance or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained subsections 11-34(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless erosion and sedimentation control plan has been approved by the district and the issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 11-34(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 11-35(b)(7) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this ordinance, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his or her successor in title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his or her successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him or her as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2004-18, § 1, 9-21-04; Ord. No. 2010-11B, §§ 8-13, 6-15-10; Ord. No. 2010-20B, § 4, 7-20-10; Ord. No. 2011-16, §§ 2, 7, 8, 10-18-11) 
Sec. 11-36. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The City of Union City will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate both primary and secondary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he or she shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
(b)  The city manager or his/her designee shall have the power to conduct such investigations as he or she may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
(c)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for purpose of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his or her official duties. 
(Ord. No. 2004-18, § 1, 9-21-04; Ord. No. 2010-11B, § 14, 6-15-10; Ord. No. 2011-16, § 9, 10-18-11) 
Sec. 11-37. - Penalties and incentives. 
(a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his occupation tax certificate, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
(b)  Stop-work orders. 
(1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director of the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five (5) days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five (5) days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
(2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
(3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
(4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
(c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person.

ARTICLE IV. - UNION CITY CHATTAHOOCHEE RIVER TRIBUTARY PROTECTION ORDINANCE 

Sec. 11-50. - Short title. 
    This ordinance will be known as the "Union City Chattahoochee River Tributary Protection Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 99-10, 4-20-99) 
Sec. 11-51. - Statutory authorization. 
    This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the requirements of section 12-5-453 of O.C.G.A. 
(Ord. No. 99-10, 4-20-99) 
Sec. 11-52. - Finding and purposes. 
(a)  Findings. The mayor and council of the City of Union City finds that: 
(1)  The Chattahoochee River provides multiple public benefits, which include use of the river as the primary water supply for metropolitan Atlanta. 
(2)  The water quality of the Chattahoochee River depends upon the water quality of the flowing streams tributary to the river. 
(3)  Sediment and other polluting materials and conditions, including but not limited to pesticides, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, toxic materials, and elevations in water temperature are harmful to the water quality of the river and its tributaries. 
(4)  The riparian vegetation along these watercourses helps preserve water quality. Dense tree and understory growth helps to prevent stream bank erosion, and stream-side vegetation reduces the amount of sediment and other polluting materials that would otherwise wash into streams. Riparian trees, by shading, help maintain cooler water temperatures and thus enhance water quality. 
(b)  Purposes. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to minimize public and private losses due to erosion, siltation and water pollution; and to maintain stream water quality in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Create vegetative buffer areas adjacent to tributary streams in the drainage area. 
(2)  Minimize land-disturbing activities within such buffer areas by requiring issuance of a permit for such activities. 
(Ord. No. 99-10, 4-20-99) 
Sec. 11-53. - Definitions. 
    Chattahoochee River Tributary Protection Area or protection area means the stream channel and the land area extending outward thirty-five (35) horizontal feet from the banks on either side of all flowing streams in the drainage basin of all tributaries of the Chattahoochee River which enters the Chattahoochee River downstream from Buford Dam and upstream of the southern limits of Douglas County on the west side of the river and the southern limits of Fulton County on the east side of the river, except for such land within the Chattahoochee River Corridor, as defined in section 12-5-441 of O.C.G.A.

(a)  Exceptions. The permit provisions of this ordinance shall not apply to: 
(1)  Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. When emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report the pertinent facts relating to the work to the permits clerk of the City of Union City on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten (10) days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the permits clerk to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability, or water quality of the protection area. 
(2)  Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land which is zoned and approved for such use on the date of adoption of this ordinance or March 1, 1999, whichever is earlier. 
(b)  Application for a permit. A separate application for a permit shall be made to the permits clerk, on a form approved by the permits clerk, for each land-disturbing activity, except that only one application need be made for two (2) or more such acts which are to be done on the same parcel. The application shall include a map of the site and such information concerning the proposed action as the permits clerk deems necessary to describe the nature and extent of the proposed action and to determine the effect of the proposed action on the protection area. 
(c)  Issuance of permit. No application for a permit shall be approved and no permit shall be issued for any land-disturbing activity within the protection area unless: 
(1)  The land-disturbing activity is for the purpose of constructing one (1) of the following: a stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or public utility; a dam and/or impoundment; or

The mayor and council shall give public notice of each such public hearing at least two (2) weeks prior to the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the City of Union City. 
(f)  Responsibility. Neither the issuance of a permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof, nor with the provisions of this ordinance shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damage to persons or property; nor shall the issuance of any permit hereunder serve to impose any liability upon the City of Union City, its officers or employees, for injury or damage to persons or property. A permit issued pursuant to this ordinance does not relieve the permittee of the responsibility of securing and complying with any other permit required by any other city ordinance or state law. 
(g)  Term of permit; extension; renewal. The permittee shall complete the work authorized by the permit within the time limits specified in the permit, which in no case shall extend more than twelve (12) months from the date of issuance.

(d)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory flood means the flood standard equal to or higher than the base flood. The regulatory flood is defined as the flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year assuming the drainage basin is fully developed as shown on the current land use plan. Only structural stormwater control facilities that can be shown will remain (i.e. owned by the City of Union City) and are large enough to be included in the hydrograph routings shall be considered when determining the flood peak. 
    Regulatory flood elevation means the flood standard equal to or higher than the base flood elevation. The regulatory flood elevation is defined as the highest water surface anticipated at any given point during the regulatory flood. 
    Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the land development project is located. 
    Start of construction means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article that permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
(Ord. No. 2004-10, § 1, 5-18-04) 
Sec. 11-85. - Permit procedures and requirements. 
(a)  Permit application requirements. No owner or developer shall perform any land development activities on a site where a regulatory floodplain is located, or is proposed to be altered or disturbed in any way, without meeting the requirements of this article prior to commencing the proposed activity. 
    Unless specifically excluded by this article, any owner or developer desiring a permit for a land development activity shall submit to the City of Union City a permit application on a form provided by the city. 
    No land development permit will be approved for any land development activities that do not meet the requirements, restrictions and criteria of this article. 
(b)  Floodplain management plan requirements. No application for a land development project within any area of special flood hazard established in section 11-80 will be approved unless it includes a floodplain management/flood damage prevention plan. This plan shall be in accordance with the criteria established in this section. 
    This plan must be submitted with the stamp and signature of a professional engineer (PE) licensed in the State of Georgia, who will verify that all designs are consistent with the requirements of this article. 
    The approved floodplain management/flood damage prevention plan shall contain certification by the applicant that all land development activities will be done according to the plan or previously approved revisions. Any and all land development permits and/or use and occupancy certificates or permits may be revoked at any time if the construction and building activities are not in strict accordance with approved plans. 
    The floodplain management/flood damage prevention plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  Plans drawn to scale of the site in question and the nature, location, and dimensions of existing or proposed structures; 
(2)  Earthen fill placement; 
(3)  Storage of materials or equipment; and 
(4)  Drainage and stormwater management facilities. 
Specifically, the following information is required: 
(1)  Site plan, including but not limited to: 
a.  For all proposed structures, spot ground elevations at building corners and twenty-foot or smaller intervals along the foundation footprint, or one (1) foot contour elevations throughout the building site; 
b.  Proposed locations of water supply, sanitary sewer, and utilities; 
c.  If available, the base flood elevation and/or regulatory flood elevation; and 
d.  If applicable, the location of the floodway. 
(2)  Foundation design detail, including but not limited to: 
a.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (or highest adjacent grade) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all structures; 
b.  For a crawl-space foundation, location and total net area of foundation openings as required in section 11-87(a) of this article. 
(3)  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any substantial improvements to an existing non-residential structure will be flood-proofed, as required in section 11-87 of this article; 
(4)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed land development project; and 
(5)  All appropriate certifications required under this article. 
(c)  Construction stage submittal requirements. For all new construction and substantial improvements on sites with a floodplain management/flood damage prevention plan, the permit holder shall provide to the city administrator a certified as-built plan showing the regulatory floor elevation or flood-proofing level immediately after the lowest floor or flood-proofing is completed. Any lowest floor certification made relative to mean sea level shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the same. When flood-proofing is utilized for non-residential structures, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. 
    Any work undertaken prior to approval of these certifications shall be at the permit holder's risk. The city administrator or his or her designee shall review the above referenced certification data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further work being allowed to proceed. Failure to submit certification or failure to make the corrections required hereby shall cause a stop work order to issue for the project. 
(d)  Duties and responsibilities of the administrator. Duties of the city administrator or his designee shall include, but shall not be limited to: 
(1)  Review all land development applications and permits to assure that the requirements of this article have been satisfied; 
(2)  Require that copies of all necessary permits from governmental agencies from which approval is required by Federal or state law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334, be provided and maintained on file; 
(3)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided, then the city administrator shall require the applicant to obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other sources in order to meet the provisions of [sub]section (4) and (5); 
(4)  Record the actual elevation in relation to mean sea level (or highest adjacent grade) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially improved structures;

(7)  Notify affected adjacent communities and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); 
(8)  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (e.g., where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the city administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. Any person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this article. Where floodplain elevations have been defined, the floodplain shall be determined based on flood elevations rather than the area graphically delineated on the floodplain maps; and 
(9)  All records pertaining to the provisions of this article shall be maintained in the office of the city administrator and shall be open to the public. 
(Ord. No. 2004-10, § 1, 5-18-04) 
Sec. 11-86. - Standards for land development. 
(a)  Definition of floodplain boundaries. 
(1)  Studied "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available. 
(2)  For special flood hazards areas and floodprone areas, the regulatory flood elevations shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by the city. 
(3)  The boundaries or limits of the floodplain shall be within 0.5 feet vertical accuracy on the site plan containing existing topographic information. 
(b)  Definition of floodway boundaries. 
(1)  The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA approved flood study. 
(2)  Following a predesign conference with the city the boundaries or limits of the floodway shall be shown on the (development or stormwater) site plan containing existing topographic information. 
(c)  General standards. 
(1)  No construction or structures, including grading, filling, cutting or displacement of earth shall be allowed within the regulatory floodplain that could result in any of the following: 
a.  Raising the regulatory flood elevation beyond the boundaries of the ownership of the property being developed unless contained in a drainage easement obtained by the developer; 
b.  Reducing the regulatory flood storage capacity. All compensation for storage capacity shall occur either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed, or within a permanent, recorded flood control easement, and shall be within a reasonable proximity to the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include: lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain; or, lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain; or raising of the regulatory flood elevation within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed. All cut areas are to be graded to a slope of no less than 1.0 percent. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (predevelopment) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel. A step-backwater analysis will be required to determine the volume of flood storage created by raising the regulatory flood elevation; 
c.  Changing the flow characteristics of the waters of the regulatory flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the property. Verification shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis; or 
d.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. In all cases effective transitions must be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased. 
(2)  All proposed development shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system, located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(3)  Any significant changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the City of Union City using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six (6) months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as built surveys which demonstrate general conformance to the approved designs as submitted in the CLOMR application. A letter of map revision (LOMR) or letter of map amendment (LOMA) must be issued before the final plat can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued. Significant changes or revisions shall be defined as any change to the FIRM easily observed when plotted at a scale of 1" = 1,000'. The changes or revisions may be due to, but are not limited to, more current and/or superior topographic information or compensatory cut and fill grading done as a part of the development. 
(d)  Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb the regulatory floodplain. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the City of Union City prior to the approval of any permit that would authorize the disturbance of land located within the floodplain. Such study shall include: 
(1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
(2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a method approved by the City of Union City. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood and regulatory flood profiles; 
(3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one (1) every one hundred (100) feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that regulatory floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
(4)  If changes to the regulatory flood elevation are proposed, profiles of the channel showing the existing and proposed regulatory flood elevations must be provided; and 
(5)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all floodplain encroachments. 
(e)  Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except when required for the construction of bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the preproject base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the regulatory or base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
(2)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the business license, tax, and permit department until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable, is issued by FEMA. 
(f)  Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The City of Union City may direct the property owner at no cost to the City of Union City to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with Union City. This shall be done at property owner's expense. 
(Ord. No. 2004-10, § 1, 5-18-04) 
Sec. 11-87. - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
(a)  General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions apply:

(2)  Substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
(3)  Substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
(4)  Substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(5)  Elevated buildings. All substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(6)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(7)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable State requirements for resisting wind forces; 
(8)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
(9)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
(10)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
(11)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(b)  Building standards for structures and buildings within the floodplain. 
(1)  Residential buildings. 
a.  New construction. New construction of principal buildings, including manufactured homes shall not be allowed within the limits of the floodplain. 
b.  Substantial improvements. Substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than three (3) feet above the base flood elevation adjacent to the building or at least as high as the regulatory flood elevation, whichever is highest. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 11-87(a)(5), elevated buildings. 
(2)  Nonresidential buildings. 
a.  New construction. New construction of principal buildings, including manufactured homes shall not be allowed within the limits of the floodplain. 
b.  Substantial improvements. Substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be authorized by the city administrator to be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, or at least as high as the regulatory flood elevation, whichever is highest, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the city administrator. 
(3)  Accessory structures and facilities. Accessory structures and facilities (i.e., barns, sheds, gazebos, detached garages, parking lots, recreational facilities and other similar structures and facilities) which are permitted to be located within the limits of the floodplain shall be designed and constructed to pass all floodwater in a manner consistent with this article. 
(4)  Standards for recreational vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
a.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
b.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "Residential Buildings-Substantial Improvements", including the anchoring and elevation requirements above. 
(5)  Building standards for structures and buildings authorized adjacent to the floodplain. 
a.  Residential buildings. For new construction or substantial improvement of any principal residential building or manufactured home, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement and access to the building, shall be at least three (3) feet above the level of the highest base flood (100-year) elevation adjacent to the building or at least as high as the regulatory flood elevation whichever is highest. 
b.  Nonresidential buildings. For new construction or substantial improvement of any principal non-residential building, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement and access to the building, shall be at least one (1) foot above the level of the highest base flood (100-year) elevation adjacent to the building or at least as high as the regulatory flood elevation whichever is highest. 
(6)  Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones) or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the city administrator shall review and reasonably utilize any available scientific or historic base flood elevation or regulatory flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions and standards of this section. If sufficient data are not available from these sources, then the city administrator may accept a hydrologic assessment performed by a registered professional engineer to determine the regulatory flood and floodway elevations. 
(7)  Building standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO-zones). Areas of special flood hazard may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. In these areas the following provisions apply: 
a.  All substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards for "Elevated Buildings." The applicant's or owner's engineer shall certify to the City Administrator that the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file; 
b.  Substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one (1) foot above the highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice; and 
c.  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
(8)  Standards for subdivisions.

If the site is filled above the base flood or regulatory flood elevation, the lowest flood and pad elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the city administrator; 
c.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
d.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; and 
e.  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(9)  Standards for utilities. 
a.  All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewerage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate: 
1.  Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 
2.  Discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
b.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located outside the floodplain to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. No. 2004-10, § 1, 5-18-04) 
Sec. 11-88. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The mayor and council as established for the City of Union City shall hear and decided requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The mayor and council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the mayor and council, any taxpayer or any officer, department, board or bureau of Union City may within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in the office of the mayor and council, but not thereafter, seek review of such decision by a court as provided by law. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the mayor and council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is a: 
a.  Finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, or cause fraud on or victimization of the public. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The city administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the mayor and council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2004-10, § 1, 5-18-04) 
Sec. 11-89. - Violations, enforcement and penalties. 
    Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this article or the requirements of an approved stormwater management plan or permit, may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section. Any such action or inaction that is continuous with respect to time is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of any of the penalties described below shall not prevent such equitable relief. 
(a)  Notice of violation. If the city determines that an applicant or other responsible person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit, an approved stormwater management plan or the provisions of this article, it shall issue a written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible person. Where a person is engaged in activity covered by this article without having first secured a permit therefore, the notice of violation shall be served on the owner or the responsible person in charge of the activity being conducted on the site. The notice of violation shall contain: 
(1)  The name and address of the owner or the applicant or the responsible person; 
(2)  The address or other description of the site upon which the violation is occurring; 
(3)  A statement specifying the nature of the violation; 
(4)  A description of the remedial measures necessary to bring the action or inaction into compliance with the permit, the stormwater management plan or this article and the date for the completion of such remedial action; 
(5)  A statement of the penalty or penalties that may be assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed; and 
(6)  A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to the business license, tax and permit department by filing a written notice of appeal within thirty (30) days after the notice of violation (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, twenty-four (24) hours notice shall be sufficient). 
(b)  Penalties. In the event the remedial measures described in the notice of violation have not been completed by the date set forth for such completion in the notice of violation, any one (1) or more of the following actions or penalties may be taken or assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation was directed. Before taking any of the following actions or imposing any of the following penalties, the City of Union City shall first notify the applicant or other responsible person in writing of its intended action, and shall provide a reasonable opportunity, of not less than ten (10) days (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, twenty-four (24) hours notice shall be sufficient) to cure such violation. In the event the applicant or other responsible person fails to cure such violation after such notice and cure period, Union City may take any one (1) or more of the following actions or impose any one (1) or more of the following penalties: 
(1)  Stop work order. Union City may issue a stop work order which shall be served on the applicant or other responsible person. The stop work order shall remain in effect until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violation or violations described therein, provided the stop work order may be withdrawn or modified to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violation or violations. 
(2)  Withhold certificate of occupancy. The City of Union City may refuse to issue a certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or being constructed on the site until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein. 
(3)  Suspension, revocation or modification of permit. The business license, tax, and permit department may suspend, revoke or modify the permit authorizing the land development project.

The City of Union City shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. 
a.  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
1.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
2.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship. 
b.  Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
(3)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
e.  At least one (1) alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
(4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and 
d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; 
f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment as denial of the variance.

Sec. 11-153. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the city's greenspace plans; 
(6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
(7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
(b)  Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (c) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one (1) or more of the following criteria: 
(1)  New development that involves the creation of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one (1) acre or more; 
(2)  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one (1) acre or more; 
(3)  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the city to be a hotspot land use; or 
(4)  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items (1) and (2) above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
(c)  [Exempt activities.] The following activities are exempt from this article: 
(1)  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
(2)  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
(3)  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and 
(4)  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the city. 
(d)  Designation of ordinance administrator. The city administrator or designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article. 
(e)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
(f)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
(g)  Stormwater design manual. Union City will utilize the policy, criteria and information including technical specifications and standards in the latest edition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and any relevant local addenda (or equivalent local stormwater management design manual), for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article. The manual may be updated and expanded periodically, based on improvements in science, engineering, monitoring and local maintenance experience.

(Ord. No. 2004-06, § 1, 4-20-04; Ord. No. 2009-14, § 1, 7-21-09) 
Sec. 11-156. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
    The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
(a)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
(1)  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
(2)  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
(3)  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
(b)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three (3) approaches: 
(1)  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
(2)  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event; 
(3)  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
(c)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm under section 11-156(b) is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the twenty-five-year return frequency storm event must be provided. This requirementshall not apply if a post-development downstream analysis of the site is both acceptable to the city and shows that uncontrolled post development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or the analysis, being acceptable to the city, shows that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
(d)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. This requirement shall not apply if a post-development downstream analysis of the site is both acceptable to the city and shows that uncontrolled post development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or the analysis, being acceptable to the city, shows that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
(e)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the City may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
(f)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one (1) or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under section 11-156(a). The applicant may, if approved by the city, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
(g)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, flared end sections, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more than one (1) parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements. 
(1)  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual; 
(2)  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and 
(3)  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual. 
(h)  Dam design guidelines. Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.

(a)  Inspections to ensure plan compliance during construction. Periodic inspections of the stormwater management system construction shall be conducted and certified by a Georgia licensed professional engineer who has been approved by the city and is retained and paid by the applicant. Construction inspections shall utilize the approved stormwater management plan for establishing compliance. All inspections shall be documented with written reports, made available to the city when requested, that contain the following information: 
(1)  The date and location of the inspection; 
(2)  Whether construction is in compliance with the approved stormwater management plan; 
(3)  Variations from the approved construction specifications; and 
(4)  Any other variations or violations of the conditions of the approved stormwater management plan. 
    If any violations are found, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. In addition to the inspections conducted by the applicant's engineer, the city may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with the approved Stormwater Management Plan. 
(b)  Final inspection and as built plans. Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted, the applicant is responsible for certifying that the completed project is in accordance with the approved stormwater management plan. All applicants are required to submit actual "as built" plans for any stormwater management facilities or practices after each phase of construction is completed.

(4)  The city manager and the departments of purview shall compile and maintain rules and guidelines applicable to the use of public property for filming, including the elements that are part of the filming, and shall apply those rules and guidelines equally regardless of the subject matter of the filming and/or the content of the speech therein.

(1)  Where the substantial risk is identified prior to the commencement of the filming, the city manager and applicable department of purview shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s). Where such efforts are unsuccessful, the city manager shall modify the permit in a manner that minimizes disruption of the filming as determined at the city manager's reasonable discretion, and that eliminates the substantial risk as reasonably determined by the department of purview. 
(2)  Where the substantial risk is not imminent and is identified after the commencement of the filming, the city manager and applicable department of purview shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s). Where such efforts are unsuccessful, the city manager shall modify the permit in a manner that minimizes disruption of the filming as determined at the city manager's reasonable discretion, and that eliminates the substantial risk as reasonably determined by the department of purview. 
(3)  Where the substantial risk is imminent as reasonably determined by the department of purview and is identified after the commencement of filming, said department may place a stop work order on the filming if it finds that the order will likely alleviate the substantial risk. The stop work order may be issued without advance notice where the department of purview deems that a delay of the order will jeopardize public health and safety, and shall be lifted as quickly as possible after the risk is eliminated. The department of purview shall notify the city manager of the stop work order within two (2) hours of its issuance. The city manager and applicable department of purview shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, that will minimize the length and impact of the stop work order as decided by the producer, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s) as determined by the department of purview. 
(4)  Changes made to the permit pursuant to this subsection (c) shall not require payment of a change fee. 
(d)  Where the city manager, or a department of purview in consultation with the city manager, determines that the producer is violating material term(s) of the permit, the city manager shall decide the appropriate remedial actions after consulting with the department of purview and the producer. If the city manager and/or department of purview finds that a substantial public health or safety risk is arising from or caused by the material violation, the department of purview in consultation with the city manager may place an immediate stop work order on the filming without prior notice to the producer, and consultation with the producer shall occur after the work stoppage. The consultation between the city manager, department of purview and producer shall evaluate the nature and severity of the violation, whether the violation was intentional, whether permit modifications should be made, whether the stop work order should be lifted (where applicable), and what other actions should be taken (if any). Where the violation creates a substantial public health and/or safety risk, the remedial actions decided by the city manager will not be deemed final until the department of purview reviews the remedial actions and confirms that they will eliminate the health and safety risks.

In the event he is unable to do so, the Marshal shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the defendant in fi fa's property, whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this article. 
(Ord. No. 98-7, § 5, 5-19-98) 
Sec. 13-8. - Levy of executions; sale of property. 
(a)  The director of the department of public safety is hereby designated as the Marshal of the City of Union City and delegated the duties set forth in this article. The marshal shall account for money in his hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the municipality. After first paying the city clerk the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, the marshal shall pay any surplus to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes, else to the defendant in fi fa. 
(b)  In all cases of levying on real property, five (5) days written notice of the levy prior to the levy must be given personally or delivered by certified mail to the defendant in fi fa. and to any tenants in possession. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the marshal shall enter the same on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi fa therein. 
(c)  Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the marshal's duty before proceeding to advertise the property for sale to give twenty (20) days written notice of the levy to the record owner(s) of the property and the holder of each security deed of record. The twenty-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner of the land, the year or years for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where, and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file the copy with the city clerk. 
(d)  When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner as provided for executions and judicial sales; provided, however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi fa shall be given at least ten (10) days' written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim or a lien on the property subject to being sold and such lien was filed or recorded more than thirty (30) days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the secretary of the treasury or his delegate not less than twenty-five (25) days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. 
(e)  The marshal shall publish weekly for four (4) weeks in the official legal organ of the city an advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the names of the owner(s) of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property as being sold for collection of taxes due to the City of Union City and the year(s) for which taxes have been executed. 
(f)  Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal before the City Hall on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, whichever is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash; provided, however, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sale shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions and neither the marshal conducting the sale, nor the City of Union City, makes any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied. 
(g)  The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or a bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the marshal to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or a bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this article shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi fa or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy and sale. Recitals in the deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provided, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired. 
(h)  Whenever no bids are forthcoming on property sold for taxes after the property has been offered a reasonable time, the marshal may either readvertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property.

Sec. 13-9. - Bidding by city at tax sale; disposition of property acquired. 
(a)  If, during any sale of property for taxes and after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the state, county, and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, then the city administrator, or his or her designee, may purchase the property for the City of Union City.

The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold. 
(b)  Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for taxes or assessments may be divested or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder; however, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs, or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided in section 13-12 of this article.

If there is any excess after paying taxes, costs, and all expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized to receive the excess. 
(b)  In any event, within ninety (90) days from the date executions are placed in his hands, the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectable in full, he shall so notify the city clerk in writing.

(a)  Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi fa on which to levy any tax execution in his hands, he shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The city clerk, in the name of the City of Union City, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he or she believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi fa or who has property, money, or effects in his hands belonging to the defendant in fi fa. The clerk shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution issued. 
(b)  When an execution for taxes remains unsatisfied and an entry of "nulla bona" has been duly entered by the marshal on the execution within the immediately proceeding thirty-day period and the city clerk has reason to believe the defendant in fi fa may have or may come into ownership of assets outside the state, the clerk, in the name of the City of Union City, may petition the Superior Court of the county in this state in which the defendant in fi fa maintains a known residence, place of business, or agent to receive service, to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi fa does not maintain a known residence in this state, the action may be brought in the county where the tax obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with Chapter 3 of Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
(Ord. No. 98-7, § 9, 5-19-98) 
Sec. 13-12. - Redemption rights of defendant in fi fa; vesting of title in grantee. 
(a)  Whenever real property is sold for taxes or any special assessment, the defendant in fi fa or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption as fixed by O.C.G.A. section 48-4-42, at any time within twelve (12) months from the date of sale, and at any time after the sale until the right to redeem is foreclosed by the giving of the notice provided for in O.C.G.A. section 48-4-45, which code sections by reference are incorporated herein as a part of this article. 
(b)  Where notice of foreclosure of the right to redeem real property sold at a tax sale has not been given as required in subsection (a) above, title shall ripen by prescription after a period of four (4) years from the date of recording of the deed in the county where the property is situated, provided the defendant in fi fa was not laboring under any legal disability at the time of sale. Unless the tax deed indicates a lesser interest was levied upon and sold, a fee simple title to the property shall vest absolutely in the grantee in the deed or in the grantee's heirs or assigns. In the event the defendant in fi fa is laboring under any legal disability, the prescriptive term shall begin from the time the disabilities are removed or abated. 
(Ord. No. 98-7, § 10, 5-19-98) 
Sec. 13-13. - Costs. 
(a)  For issuing executions, the city shall receive only an amount equal to any filing fees charged by the Clerk of Superior Court for recording and cancellation of the tax fi fa. 
(b)  In addition to the levy administration fee, after levy but prior to the sale, the marshal shall collect his actual cost for advertising the sale, postage and service fees actually incurred, and any attorney's fees incurred in examination of title to property.

In order for the municipality to properly impose such excise tax the municipality must follow all of the provisions of O.C.G.A. Title 48, Ch. 13, Art. 6, one (1) provision of which is the enactment of this article.

Title 48, Ch. 8, Art. 1, but for the exemption found in the O.C.G.A. § 48-8-3.2. 
(b)  The sales or use of energy when such sale or use would have constituted a taxable event for purposes of sales and use tax under O.C.G.A. Title 48, Ch. 8, Art. 1, but for the exemption found in the O.C.G.A. § 48-8-3.2 includes, but is not limited to, the items listed in subsection (e) of the same code section.

(d)  In the event the total rate of local sales and use taxes in effect in the city decreases from two (2) percent to one (1) percent, the rate of the excise tax under this article shall likewise be reduced at the same time such local sales and use tax rate reduction becomes effective.

Service shall not be resumed until all delinquent bills and additional charges accrued, as provided hereinafter, have been paid in full. 
(2)  Master meters or shared meters. In those situations in which two (2) or more residences or tenants are served by a master meter or a shared meter and where the entity responsible for making payment to the city has not paid the bill within five (5) days of the due date printed on the bill for water services, the city shall notify said entity of its intention to discontinue water service, the city shall notify said entity of its intention to discontinue water service to the meter if payment is not made within five (5) days of receipt of the notification.

Regardless of the type of meter used, if the customer has filed an application to dispute his or her water bill with the city administrator, there shall be no disconnection of service pending the city administrator's determination as to the merit of the dispute. If the city administrator determines that the dispute is without merit, the customer's service shall be disconnected if the customer does not appeal the city administrator's determination to the mayor and city council within the time specified in subsection (c) above. If the customer appeals the decision within the specified time, there shall be no disconnection of service pending a hearing before the mayor and city council. However, if such delinquent customer fails to attend a scheduled hearing before the mayor and city council, the utility service shall be terminated as scheduled.

No valves, fire hydrants, tees, reaction blocking or lot services shall be backfilled without the approval of the inspector. 
(c)  Pipe foundation and laying. Clean interior of pipe and all joints before laying. When pipe laying activity is not in actual progress, tightly cover open ends of pipe. Avoid permitting dirt, mud, or other material from entering pipe at any time. Avoid damage or shock in handling pipe and accessories. Inspect each length of pipe and reject any defective piece. Carefully protect pipe in place from damage or displacement until backfilling operations are complete. Cut pipe in a manner to avoid damage to pipe or lining, leaving a smooth end at right angles to pipe axis. Smooth and bevel edges of cut pipe for push-on, gasket type joints. Lay pipe at depth dictated by field conditions, but with distance from top of pipe to finished grade not less than forty-two (42) inches unless otherwise shown or specified. Found pipe on firm soil or coarse granular material in flat bottom trench with entire pipe barrel bearing uniformly on trench bottom, except for an approximately eighteen-inch gap at pipe balance point for sling removal. Hand excavate and backfill as required to provide uniform and continuous bearing and support for the pipe. Do not support pipe on hubs or end bells. Consolidate soil under and around pipe up to pipe centerline by tamping. Join pipe with bells facing direction in which laying operation is progressing. Lay pipe upgrade wherever line grade exceeds ten (10) percent. Control geometric position of pipe to ensure that pipe and fittings accurately conform with grade and alignment requirements. Lay pipe in a straight line or with uniform sweeping horizontal and vertical curves for proper alignment. Do not exceed manufacturer's recommended maximum joint deflection. Prevent water from accumulating or running in trench during pipe laying operations or before the trench has been backfilled. Adjust pipe depth or alignment to accommodate valve, hydrant or fitting settings, and as necessary to meet tie-in requirements or to avoid obstructions.

Anchor all bends, valves, tees, fire hydrants, reducers and other points of unbalanced pressure as necessary to resist thrust at test and working pressures, with suitable allowance for water hammer. Also anchor piping system installed on steep slopes where gravitational force might otherwise cause piping displacement. Accomplish piping system anchorage by use of concrete reaction bracing, metal tie rods and bands, or restrained joint systems. When using concrete reaction bracing, pour concrete against firm earth and allow it to cure for at least five (5) days before placing main under pressure. Position concrete blocks of sufficient size to counteract the magnitude and direction of the resultant thrust force. Accomplish fire hydrant assembly anchorage by use of metal tie rods and bands or restrained joint systems. Keep joints and hydrant drain openings clear and accessible. Provide special support blocks at plastic pipes according to manufacturer's recommendation. When using bands and tie rods in conjunction with reaction bracing, provide a separate band for each tie rod. Use corrosion resistant materials throughout. When using restrained joint systems, utilize methods and place these special joints at appropriate fittings and pipe joints in accordance with manufacturer's recommendation. Anchorage detailed on drawings, if any, represents minimum anchorage to be installed. Field conditions may require additional anchorage, and it is the contractor's responsibility to recognize such additional requirements and to provide appropriate additional anchorage.

Bleed all air from system prior to testing, providing any necessary corporation stops and piping installations. Pressure test all elements of the piping system. Where piping is buried or otherwise concealed, maintain the pressure test for not less than six (6) hours. Visible piping may be tested for a lesser time period, if approved by the city. Conduct pressure testing at two hundred (200) psig unless a lower pressure is recommended by a manufacturer of an element of the system. When a manufacturer does recommend a lower test pressure, furnish the engineer with a detailed written explanation before commencing test work. In no event may the lower test pressure be less than one hundred ten (110) percent of the nominal working pressure of the pipe comprising the system. Measure pressure for testing referred to the elevational datum of the lowest pipe of the line section being tested. Where possible, use methods and perform construction work in such sequence as necessary to accomplish pressure testing as work progresses. Do not pressure test more than a one (1) mile length of pipe at one (1) time. Provide temporary piping and accessories if required to isolate test sections. Makeup water, required to maintain test pressure in gallons per hour per one thousand (1,000) feet of pipe under test, over the test period may not exceed the quantities shown in the following table:

(m)  Disinfecting. Chlorinate all potable waterlines on completion of construction, after flushing and prior to placing in service. Use precaution to prevent backflow to supply system. Fill lines with potable water containing sufficient chlorine to show a twenty-five (25) ppm minimum residual at the end of the twenty-four-hour retention period, (fifty-ppm minimum applied). Locate application point at beginning of pipeline extension and apply chlorine by means of a solution feed device. Operate all valves and hydrants while filling the pipeline with chlorinating agent. Draw off at taps and hydrants along the line until an ortho-tolidine test shows a strong indication of residual chlorine. Retain chlorinated water in the system for a period of twenty-four (24) hours. Test for twenty-five-ppm residual. If residual is twenty-five (25) ppm or greater flush the system with potable water, otherwise repeat entire procedure until satisfactory results are obtained. Demonstrate lines to be free of contamination by drawing samples therefrom on two (2) successive days in the presence of the engineer. Deliver samples to the city for forwarding to a qualified laboratory for examination. On receipt of satisfactory test report from the foregoing laboratory, and with the approval of the city, the lines so tested are to be considered free of contamination and placed in service. In the event contamination persists, resterilize as necessary until receipt of satisfactory test report.

(d)  When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner provided as that for executions and judicial sales; however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi. fa. shall be given at least ten (10) days written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the customer and/or property owner at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim or a lien on the property subject to the property's sale and such claim or lien was filed or recorded more than thirty (30) days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the secretary of the treasury or his delegate not less than twenty-five (25) days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service, or by registered mail or by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
(e)  For four (4) weeks, in the official legal organ of the city, the marshal shall publish a weekly advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted. This advertisement shall also include a full and complete description of the property to be sold, and the known names of the customers and/or owners of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state that the property is being sold for collection of fees due to the City of Union City and the period of time for which said fees accrued which gave rise to the execution for satisfaction. 
(f)  Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal, before the county courthouse, on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, whichever is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash. However, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sale shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. As to the title and soundness of all property sold under fee executions, the purchaser bears all risks. Neither the marshal conducting the sale, nor the City of Union City, makes any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, express or implied. 
(g)  The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sale price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who purchases any property sold at said sale shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money regardless of purchaser failure or refusal to comply with the terms of sale upon request by the marshal. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. Upon a sale for fees conducted pursuant to this ordinance, the deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered by the marshal shall convey title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of property shall be final. Recitals in the deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property sold pursuant to this ordinance. 
(h)  If, after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no bids are forthcoming on property sold for fees, the marshal may either readvertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and held out for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids. 
(Ord. No. 2003-01, § 5, 2-18-03) 
Sec. 15-209. - Bidding by city at sale, disposition of property acquired. 
(a)  If, after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale of property for fees makes a bid for the property being sold that is high enough to equal or exceed the total of fees due plus the marshal's cost of the sale, then the city administrator, or his or her designee, may purchase the property for the City of Union City. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city administrator. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold. 
(b)  Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for fees may be divested or alienated by the city only pursuant to a public sale of the property to the highest bidder.

Sec. 15-210. - Accounting by marshal; final return or settlement. 
(a)  The Marshal shall make a prompt accounting of all property placed in his possession due to an execution for collection or levying for sale to the city clerk. He shall pay over to the clerk all amounts due the city for fees, interest, penalties, and costs, and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid and the final disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying fees, costs, and expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized by this ordinance to receive the excess. 
(b)  If, within ninety (90) days from the date an execution is placed in his possession, the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectable in full, he shall so notify the city utilities clerk in writing. It shall be the duty of the clerk to cause cancellation of the execution on the general execution docket of the county at the time of final payment or collection upon said execution. 
(Ord. No. 2003-01, § 7, 2-18-03) 
Sec. 15-211. - Garnishments by city; reduction of executions to judgment. 
(a)  Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi. fa. on which to levy any fee execution in his possession, he shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The city utilities clerk, in the name of the City of Union City, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he or she believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi. fa. or who has property, money, or effects in his possession belonging to the defendant in fi. fa. The clerk shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution issued. 
(b)  When an execution for fees remains unsatisfied and an entry of "nulla bona" has been duly entered by the marshal on the execution within the immediately proceeding thirty (30) day period and the city utilities clerk has reason to believe the defendant in fi. fa. may have or may come into ownership of assets outside the state of Georgia, the city utilities clerk, in the name of the City of Union City, may petition the Superior Court of the county in Georgia in which the defendant in fi. fa. maintains a known residence, place of business, or agent to receive service, to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi. fa. does not maintain a known residence in Georgia, the action may be brought in the county where the fee obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with Chapter 3 of Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
(Ord. No. 2003-01, § 8, 2-18-03) 
Sec. 15-212. - Costs. 
(a)  For issuing executions, the city shall receive only an amount equal to any filing fees charged by the clerk of Superior Court for recording plus the cancellation fee of the fi. fa. 
(b)  In addition to the levy administration fee, after levy but prior to the sale, the marshal shall collect his actual cost for advertising the sale, postage and service fees actually incurred, and any attorney's fees incurred in examination of title to property. 
(c)  The costs provided in this section shall be cumulative and in addition to any other statutory premiums allowed.

ARTICLE VI. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

Sec. 15-300. - Short title. 
    This article will be known as the "Union City Stormwater Utility Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 2012-10, § 1, 6-19-12) 
Sec. 15-301. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the establishment of a stormwater utility in the City of Union City. The objectives of this article are stated as follows: 
(1)  The professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and submitted to the mayor and council properly assess and define the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the city. 
(2)  Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city, it is appropriate to authorize the establishment of a separate accounting unit which shall be dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater systems in the city. 
(3)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city. Intense urban development in the city has radically altered the natural hydrology of the area and the hydraulics of stormwater systems, with many natural elements having been replaced or augmented by man-made facilities. As a result, the specific service, system and facility demands in the city now exceed the service capability of many of the systems. An advanced level of service is needed in the city due to its urbanization, therefore a stormwater utility service area subject to stormwater service charges should encompass the entirety of the city to enable the city to successfully manage, operate and improve stormwater systems at an advanced level. 
(4)  It is most equitable that a portion of the needed stormwater service level continue to be funded from the city's general tax revenues, and therefore that the mayor and council may allocate general fund support to stormwater management in the future in the form of a combination of service charge payments for city-owned properties and a supplemental allocation of general fund funding. 
(5)  The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Funding of stormwater services and facilities is therefore incidental to the fundamental regulatory function of the city in protecting the public health, safety and welfare. 
(6)  Provision of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city and to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses, and the service and benefits differ among the individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents in relation to the demands they impose individually and collectively on the stormwater systems. 
(7)  The service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater programs, systems and facilities, and risk exposure. It is not practical to allocate the cost of the city's stormwater management programs, systems and facilities in direct relationship to the services or benefits rendered to or received by individual properties or persons over a brief span of time, but it is both practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among properties and persons in proportion to the long-term demands they impose on the city's stormwater programs, systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits. 
(8)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed, installed and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and of future additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance the stormwater systems and facilities in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
(9)  The mayor and council find, conclude and determine that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and benefits throughout the city, and the most equitable means to fund an advanced level of stormwater services in the city through stormwater service charges and other mechanisms as described in the professional engineering and financial analyses prepared for the city. 
(b)  Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply throughout the corporate area of Union City. 
(c)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
(d)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
(e)  Responsibility for administration. The city manager shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2012-10, § 1, 6-19-12) 
Sec. 15-302. - Establishment of a utility and an enterprise fund. 
(a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility which shall be responsible for stormwater management programs throughout the city, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities. The stormwater utility management unit shall be composed of such personnel, employees and agents of the city as the mayor and council may from time to time determine and their compensation shall be fixed and determined by the city manager as approved by the mayor and council. 
(b)  A stormwater enterprise fund shall be established in the city budget and accounting system for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees and licenses as may be established by the mayor and council and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the stormwater utility. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater enterprise fund and all expenses of the utility shall be paid from the stormwater enterprise fund, except that other revenues receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management programs, facilities, operations and capital investments as deemed appropriate by the mayor and council, upon recommendation by the city manager. 
(c)  The mayor and council hereby confer upon the stormwater utility operational control over the existing stormwater management programs, systems and facilities performed, provided or owned and heretofore operated by the city and other related assets, including but not limited to properties other than roadways upon which such systems and facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment used solely for stormwater management. 
(Ord. No. 2012-10, § 1, 6-19-12) 
Sec. 15-303. - Definitions. 
    [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
    Customers of the stormwater utility. Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties and entities served by and/or benefitting from the utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, regulation and improvement of the stormwater management programs, systems and facilities and regulation of public and private stormwater systems, facilities and activities related thereto, and persons, properties and entities which will ultimately be served or benefitted as a result of the stormwater management program. 
    Hydrologic response. The hydrologic response of a property is the manner whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including but not limited to the presence of impervious area, the size, shape, topographic, vegetative and geologic conditions of a property, antecedent moisture conditions and groundwater conditions on a property. 
    Impervious surfaces. Impervious surfaces are those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, paved areas and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development or other imposition of impervious surfaces. 
    Stormwater management systems and facilities. Stormwater management systems and facilities are those natural and man-made channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, area drains, drop inlets, junction boxes, pipes, head walls, flared end sections, storm sewers, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff. 
    Undeveloped land. Land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state. 
(Ord. No. 2012-10, § 1, 6-19-12) 
Sec. 15-304. - Scope of responsibility for the city stormwater system and facilities. 
(a)  The city owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvement of those stormwater systems and facilities which: 
(1)  Are located within public streets, rights-of-way and easements; 
(2)  Are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of systems and facilities; or 
(3)  Are located on public lands to which the city has adequate access for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of systems and facilities. 
(b)  Operation, maintenance and/or improvement of stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the city and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of the systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. 
(c)  It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of all properties and persons in general by regulation of the stormwater system and facilities, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specific property within or outside the boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. 
(d)  To the extent any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the city, pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation, or rule of the city or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the city, its officers, employees or agents. 
(Ord. No. 2012-10, § 1, 6-19-12) 
Sec. 15-305. - Requirements for on-site stormwater systems: Enforcement methods and inspections. 
(a)  All property owners and developers of real property to be developed within the city shall provide, manage, maintain and operate on-site stormwater systems and facilities sufficient to collect, convey, detain, control and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all city development regulations and the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by the city in the municipal court. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof charged to the owner in the same manner as a stormwater service charge. 
(b)  In the event that the city shall file an action pursuant to subsection (a), from the date of filing such action the city shall have lien rights in relation to any service charge assessed against the property in the same manner as a tax levied against the property, which rights may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia. In addition, the city shall have the right to pursue collection of the service charge through other legal action or judgment. 
(c)  The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private property and public property owned by other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with any order or judgment entered pursuant to this section. 
(Ord. No. 2012-10, § 1, 6-19-12) 
Sec. 15-306. - General funding policy. 
(a)  It shall be the policy of the city that funding for the stormwater utility program, systems and facilities shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater program, systems and facilities by individual properties or persons and/or the level of service rendered by or resulting from the provision of stormwater programs, systems and facilities. Stormwater service charge rates shall be structured so as to be fair and reasonable, and the resultant service charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing services and facilities. Similarly situated properties shall be charged similar rentals, rates, charges, fees or licenses. Service charge rates shall be structured to be consistent and coordinated with the use of other funding methods employed for stormwater management within the city, including but not limited to, general tax revenues allocated to stormwater management, plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in-lieu of regulatory requirements, impact fees, system development charges and special assessments. 
(b)  The cost of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities may include operating, capital investment and reserve expenses, and may consider stormwater quality as well as stormwater quantity management problems, needs and requirements. 
(c)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater service charges and/or other methods of funding stormwater management shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater systems or facilities or to private stormwater facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater systems or facilities. 
(d)  Stormwater utility service charge rates, fees and other similar charges shall be established by the mayor and council.

(Ord. No. 2012-11, § 1, 6-19-12) 
Sec. 15-327. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the establishment of stormwater utility rates in the City of Union City. The objectives of this article are stated as follows: 
(1)  The professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and considered to the mayor and council properly assess, define and project the cost of stormwater management systems and facilities of the city. 
(2)  Given the projected cost of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city, it is appropriate to adopt a stormwater service fee rate methodology and to charge service fees to properties and persons within the city in a manner that recovers the cost of programs, systems and facilities and other costs associated therewith, including but not limited to allocations of the cost of services provided to the stormwater management utility by other funds of the city and other government entities and agencies, interest on bonds, operational and emergency reserves, allowances for delinquencies and bad debt, and such other costs as may be deemed reasonable and appropriate by the mayor and council of the city to ensure the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater programs, systems and facilities in the city. 
(3)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city and the stormwater service fee rate methodology and service fees should be applicable throughout the city to enable the city to successfully manage, operate and improve stormwater programs, systems and facilities at an advanced level.

    [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
    Credits. Credit shall mean a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service fee or other fees, rates, rentals, charges, fines and penalties to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility, or continuing provision of a service or activity that reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management systems and facilities. 
    Developed land. Developed land shall mean property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than two hundred (200) square feet of impervious surfaces as defined in this chapter. 
    Duplexes and triplexes. Duplexes and triplexes shall mean developed land containing two (2) (duplex) or three (3) (triplex) residential dwelling units located within the same building on one (1) or more parcels of land. 
    Equivalent residential unit. For the purposes of this article, an equivalent residential unit shall mean 2.80 thousand (2,800) square feet of impervious surfaces for other than special developed lands. For special developed lands, the equivalent residential unit shall mean 6.50 thousand (6,500) square feet of impervious surfaces. The equivalent residential unit shall be used as the basis for determining stormwater service fees to single-family dwelling unit properties or classes of single-family dwelling unit properties, other developed lands, and special developed lands. 
    Multiple-family dwelling unit residential properties. Multiple-family dwelling unit residential properties shall mean developed land whereon more than one (1) residential dwelling unit is located, and shall include, but not be limited to, apartment houses, structures containing multiple residential condominiums located on a single parcel of property, boarding houses, group homes, hotels and motels, personal care homes, homes for the elderly, retirement and nursing homes, and other structures in which more than one (1) family group commonly and normally reside or could reside.

Single-family dwelling unit shall mean developed land upon which is located one (1) principal structure that contains one (1) dwelling unit designed for occupancy by one (1) family, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities. Single-family dwelling units may include houses, duplexes, triplexes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located on one (1) or more individual lots or parcels of land, and fee-simple ownership or condominium townhomes and attached single-family residential structures located on individual lots or parcels of land and such single units located on more than one (1) individual lot or parcel of land. For the purposes of this article, developed land may be classified as a single-family dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental and/or accessory structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports or small storage buildings, accessory dwellings or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional areas of impervious surfaces such as parking spaces, playgrounds or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship or similar nonresidential uses. Single-family dwelling units shall not include developed land containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by others than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple-family residential units that are individually owned but are located on a single parcel of developed land, such as condominiums and cooperatively-owned apartments. 
    Special developed lands . Special developed lands shall mean all single-parcel developments which contain in excess of four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet of impervious surfaces. 
    Stormwater service fees. Stormwater service fees shall mean the periodic service fee imposed pursuant to this article by the city for the purpose of recovering and/or funding costs related to stormwater management systems and facilities. The use of the area of impervious surface on each property as a measure to determine the stormwater service fee rate shall not preclude the use of other measures, or of grouping of properties having similar characteristics into classes or categories, grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one (1) or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the city's cost of providing stormwater management systems and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service fees may also include certain special charges to individual properties or persons for stormwater management systems and facilities or services related to stormwater management, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced levels of stormwater service above and beyond the service levels normally provided by city. 
(Ord. No. 2012-11, § 1, 6-19-12; Ord. No. 2016-05, §§ 1, 2, 9-20-16) 
Sec. 15-329. - Stormwater service fee rates. 
    Stormwater service fee rates may be determined and modified from time to time by the mayor and council of the city so that the total revenue generated by said fees and any other sources of revenues or other resources allocated to stormwater management by the mayor and council shall be sufficient to meet the cost of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities, including but not limited to the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, operating expense, capital outlays, non-operating expense, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the mayor and council of the city. 
    Stormwater service fee revenues in any given year may exceed or be less than the cost of service in that year, provided, however, that the stormwater service fee rate shall be based on meeting the long-term projected cost of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities. All unencumbered stormwater management funds derived from service fees and other sources of revenue not expended at the end of a fiscal year shall remain in the stormwater management utility enterprise fund account and balances shall be forwarded to the next fiscal year. The stormwater service fee rates are as follows: 
(1)  Single-family dwelling units . Single-family dwelling units, as defined by this article, shall be billed for one equivalent residential unit, as defined in this article. 
(2)  Other developed lands . All developed lands not classified as single-family dwelling units or special developed lands, as defined by this article, shall be billed for one (1) equivalent residential unit, as defined by this article, for each 2.80 thousand (2,800) square feet of impervious surfaces or partial increment thereof located on the property. 
(3)  Special developed lands . All special developed lands, as defined in this article, shall be billed for one (1) equivalent residential unit, as defined in this article, for each 6.50 thousand (6,500) square feet of impervious surfaces or partial increment thereof located on the property. 
    The stormwater service charge rate per equivalent residential unit, as defined in this article, shall be four dollars ($4.00) per month. 
(Ord. No. 2012-11, § 1, 6-19-12; Ord. No. 2016-05, § 3, 9-20-16) 
Sec. 15-330. - Exemptions and credits applicable to stormwater service fees. 
    Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater utility service fees or receive a credit or offset against such service fees. No exemption, credit, offset or other reduction in stormwater service fees shall be granted based on the age, tax, or economic status, race or religion of the customer, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management systems and facilities. A stormwater utility service fee credit application and instructions shall be prepared by the city engineer and approved by the mayor and council specifying the design and performance standards of on-site stormwater systems, facilities and activities that qualify for application of a service fee credit, and how such credits shall be calculated. 
(1)  Properties that are not defined in this article as being developed land shall be exempt from stormwater service fees. 
(2)  Railroad tracks; gravel and stone areas underneath and immediately adjacent to the tracks; and undeveloped portions of the railroad right of way shall be exempt from stormwater service fees. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, paved or unpaved service roads and drives, or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service fees. 
(3)  Developed land than other single-family dwelling units, including, but not limited to, multiple-family dwelling unit residential properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial, retail and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks and other recreational properties, public and private schools and universities, research facilities and stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, and water and wastewater treatment plants and all other types of developed land except single-family dwelling units may receive a credit against the stormwater service fee applicable to the property. The stormwater utility service fee credit for on-site stormwater control systems or facilities that reduce or mitigate the impact of impervious surfaces on the subject property shall be proportional to the extent that the on-site stormwater control systems or facilities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner meets or exceeds the city's development and performance standards contained in the stormwater utility service fee credit application and instructions and other requirements and conditions. The amount of the stormwater utility service fee credit shall not be related to the cost incurred by the property owner for performing, constructing, providing and/or maintaining such programs, systems, facilities, services and activities. 
(4)  Groups of single-family dwelling units represented by an incorporated homeowner's association that owns, operates and maintains on-site stormwater control systems or facilities, or that provides services or activities that reduce or mitigate the impact of impervious surfaces located on the subject properties may receive a credit against the stormwater service fee applicable to the properties represented by the homeowner's association. Such service fee credit shall be based on attaining and continuing compliance with the technical requirements and performance standards contained in the stormwater utility service fee credit application and instructions and other requirements and conditions. The stormwater utility service fee credit for on-site stormwater control systems or facilities, or for services or activities provided by groups of single-family dwelling units represented by an incorporated homeowner's association shall be proportional to the extent that the on-site stormwater control systems or facilities provided, operated and maintained by the homeowner's association meets or exceeds the city's development and performance standards contained in the stormwater utility service fee credit application and instructions and other requirements and conditions. Such credits shall be proportionately allocated among all properties presented by the incorporated homeowner's association. The stormwater utility service fee credit for services and activities that reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management systems and facilities shall not be related to the cost of such services and activities to the homeowner's association or any person or entity providing same. 
(5)  Individual single-family dwelling units required by the city to install on-site detention or that provide services or activities that reduce or mitigate the impact of impervious surfaces located on the subject properties may receive a credit against the stormwater service fee applicable to the subject property. Such service fee credit shall be based on attaining and continuing compliance with the technical requirements and performance standards contained in the stormwater utility service fee credit application and instructions and other requirements and conditions. The stormwater utility service fee credit for on-site stormwater control systems or facilities, or for services or activities provided by individual single-family dwelling units shall be a fixed amount and shall be subject to the requirement that the on-site stormwater control systems or facilities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner meet the city's development standards and performance standards contained in the stormwater utility service fee credit application and instructions and other requirements and conditions. The stormwater utility service fee credit for services, facilities and activities shall not be related to the cost of such services and activities to the homeowner or any person or entity providing same. 
(Ord. No. 2012-11, § 1, 6-19-12) 
Sec. 15-331. - Stormwater service fee billing, delinquencies, and collections. 
    A stormwater service fee bill may be sent though the United States mail or by alternative means, notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. The stormwater service fee bill may be billed and collected along with other fees and charges, including but not limited to, other utility bills, assessments or property taxes, as deemed most effective and efficient by the city manager. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for non-payment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fees and other charges and any associated fines or penalties, including but not limited to, interest on delinquent service fees. If a customer is underbilled or if no bill is sent for developed land, the city may back bill for a period of up to one (1) year, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency during that back billed period. A late charge of five (5) percent of the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility service fee bill shall be charged when a bill becomes delinquent. Thereafter, an additional charge of one (1) percent based on the unpaid bill and any applicable delinquency charge shall be charged for each month the bill remains delinquent. 
(1)  Stormwater service fee bills for commercial or multiple residential condominium properties may be delivered to the individual condominium owners apportioning the stormwater service fee for the entire property equally among all properties. 
(Ord. No. 2012-11, § 1, 6-19-12) 
Sec. 15-332. - Appeals. 
    Any customer who believes the provisions of this article have been applied in error may appeal in the following manner and sequence. 
(1)  An appeal must be filed in writing with the city manager or her/his designated representative. In the case of stormwater service fee appeals, the appeal shall include a survey prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer containing information on the total property area, the impervious surface area, and any other features or conditions that influence the hydrologic response of the property to rainfall events. 
(2)  Using information provided by the appellant, the city manager shall conduct a technical review of the conditions on the property and respond to the appeal in writing within sixty (60) days. In response to an appeal, the city manager may adjust the stormwater service fee applicable to any property in conformance with the general purposes and intent of this article. 
(3)  All decisions by the city manager shall be served on the appellant personally or by registered or certified mail, sent to the billing address of the appellant. All decisions of the city manager shall be final. 
(4)  Any person aggrieved by a decision or order of the city, after exhausting his/her administrative remedies, shall have a right to appeal de novo to the Superior Court of Fulton County.

Section 4.1 Street Improvements
Streets, whether abutting or internal, existing or new, public or private, shall be constructed or
improved under those circumstances and to the standards as established in these Regulations.
Roadway improvements shall be in accordance with the street classification system defined in
the Land Subdivision Regulations. Specific street classification designations shall be as shown in
adopted transportation plans of the City or as established by the Planning Commission.
Section 4.2 Minimum Right-of-Way and Pavement Widths
The minimum widths for public rights-of-way or private street ingress/egress easements and
pavements shall be as given in the Land Subdivision Regulations or shown on standard
drawings.
On any existing street having a right-of-way less than the minimum which abuts a property
being developed, one-half of the required width of right-of-way shall be dedicated at no cost to
the City along the entire property boundary abutting the existing street.
Additional street right-of-way width may be required to be dedicated at intersections or other
locations fronting the property where turning lanes, storage lanes, medians, islands, or
realignments are required for traffic safety and minimum right-of-way standards would be
inadequate to accommodate the improvements.
Section 4.3 Street Widening
When property fronting on an existing City street is to be developed and when the property is
to be accessed from the existing City street, roadway improvements (pavement, curb and gutter
and drainage) are required along the existing road across the entire property frontage.
Required improvements shall not be less than provided in these Regulations for the designated
street classification.
Widening, curb and gutter and drainage shall be provided from the centerline of the existing
roadway along the side of the road upon which the property abuts. In lieu of installation of
curbs and gutters and/or related improvements, the developer must have presented to and
received approval by the City for a Street Improvements and Storm Water Drainage Plan for the
development and its affected environs. Said plan must provide for adequate storm water
drainage, and will further address as a minimum, street grading, paving, and curbs and gutters,
and or other innovative provisions for said drainage. This plan must conform to the applicable
standards and specification established by the City and be prepared, signed, and sealed by a
Georgia registered professional engineer.
The developer shall be responsible for the relocation and/or modifications of public and/or
private utilities as necessitated by the required street improvements.
Section 4.4 New Streets
All public streets proposed to be constructed in a subdivision or other development shall be
designed and constructed at least to the standards contained in these Regulations in
accordance with the appropriate street classification of said streets.
Section 4.5 Substandard Streets
In the event that a development has access to a substandard street and if that substandard
street provides the primary means of access to the development, the substandard street, except
as indicated below, shall be fully upgraded along the entire property frontage and continuing to
the nearest standard paved road along the route of primary access.
In the event that a development has access to a substandard street and if that substandard
street is other than the primary means of access to the development, the substandard street,
except as indicated below, shall be fully upgraded only along the entire property frontage and
shall be paved on the opposite side of the road from the development, 12 feet from the street
centerline.
The upgrading of substandard streets used for access will not be required if any of the following
conditions are met:
(a) The development consists of a single one or two family residence on an existing
recorded lot within the City;
(b) Total traffic on the substandard street is less than 2000 vehicles per day including
projected traffic volume from the development; or
(c) The development is a small business with ingress/egress of less than 100 vehicles
per day.
Section 4.6 Acceleration/Deceleration Lanes
Except as indicated, acceleration and deceleration lanes shall be provided for new street and
driveway connections to existing streets. The lanes will not be required if any of the following
conditions are met:
(a) The driveway is for a one or two family residence;
(b) Total traffic on the existing roadway is less than 3000 vehicles per day (count of
existing traffic must have been made within one year of the development plan
submittal date);
(c) The driveway is for a small business with ingress/egress of less than 150 vehicles
per day; or
Section 4.7 Improvements Along State and Federal Highways
For any development which abuts a State or Federal highway, improvements to the highway
and the location and design of any street or driveway providing access from the highway shall
comply with the standards and requirements of the Georgia Department of Transportation. A
copy of the approved Georgia DOT permit shall be provided to the City prior to issuance of land
disturbing or building permits.
Section 4.8 Specifications
Unless otherwise specifically set forth herein, all of the materials, methods of construction, and
workmanship for street construction shall conform to the latest edition of the Georgia
Department of Transportation Standard Specifications - Construction of Transporation Systems
including all amendments.
Section 4.9 Subgrade Preparation
(a) Clear and grub entire street right-of-way before commencing street earthwork
construction. For specific technical requirements reference is made to Georgia
DOT Specifications Section 201-Clearing and Grubbing Right-of-Way.
Combustible material generated from clearing and grubbing operations may be
burned only when authorized and permitted by the Union City Fire Marshall.
(b) Conduct street earthwork construction in accordance with Georgia DOT
Specification Sections 205 - Roadway Excavation and 208 - Embankments. For

(2) Maximum hourly commercial/institutional sewage flow.
(3) Maximum hourly industrial sewage flow.
(4) Ground water infiltration.
(5) Topography of the area.
(6) Pumping requirements.
Design new sewers in residential areas on the basis of an average daily flow of
sewage of not less than 400 gallons per household per day. A peaking factor of
not less than 2.5 must be applied to the average daily flow to establish peak
design flow. Sewers shall be designed to carry peak design flow when flowing
one-half full.
In non-residential developments, base sewer design on the estimated peak flow
from the development but in no case less than 0.4 gallon per square foot of gross
building areas. Sewers shall be designed to carry peak flow when flowing
one-half full.
(b) Size and Shape: The minimum size sanitary sewer shall be 8 inches. Design
sewers to give mean velocities, when flowing half full, of not less than 2.0 feet per
second based on the Manning formula using an "n" value of 0.013. Table 5.3
gives the minimum slopes which must be provided, however, where possible
greater slopes are desirable.
Place sewers with a uniform slope between manholes.
(c) Manholes: Install manholes at the following locations:
(1) End of each sewer.
(2) At all changes in grade, size, or alignment.
(3) At all sewer intersections
(4) At distances not greater than 400 feet for sewer 15 inches and smaller.
When changing pipe sizes at a manhole, align the 0.8 depth point of both sewers
at the same elevation. When the same size pipe enters and leaves a manhole,
provide at least a 0.1 foot drop in elevation between the entering and the exiting
inverts. Construct a U shaped flow channel through manholes.
(d) Relation to Water Mains: Whenever possible, lay sewers at least 10 feet
horizontally from any existing or proposed water main. Should conditions
prevent a separation of 10 feet, lay the lines in separate trenches. In either case,
construct the elevation of the crown of the sewer at least 18 inches below the
bottom of the water main.
When sewers cross under water mains, lay the sewer so that the top of the sewer
is at least 18 inches below the bottom of the water main. Install the two pipes
such that a full length of pipe will be centered over the crossing so that all joints
will be separated as much as possible. Install ductile iron pipe for both lines
when the crossing is less than two feet of separation.

APPEALS PROCEDURE
Section 9.1 Appeals, Hearings, and Notice
Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department,
board or bureau of the City. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by
the rules of the Board by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the
Board of Zoning Appeals' notice of said appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The City
Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon
which the action appealed from was taken.
An appeal stays all legal proceeding in furtherance of the action appealed from , unless the
officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal shall have
been filed with the officer, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in the
officer's opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not
be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a
court of record on application, on notices to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and on
due cause shown.
The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or other matter referred to it,
and give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the
same within a reasonable time. At the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or
by attorney.
Section 9.2 Powers and Duties
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the following powers and duties:
- To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by the City Administrator in the enforcement of this
Ordinance.
- To authorize, upon appeal, in specific cases a variance from the terms of this Ordinance
as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, vowing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance will in an individual case, result in
unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the Ordinance shall be observed, public safety
and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such
individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the Board of Zoning Appeals
that:
(a) there are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular
piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography;
(b) the application of the Ordinance to this particular piece of property would create
an unnecessary hardship;
(c) such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
(d) relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or
impair the purpose and intent of this Ordinance, provided, however, that no
variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is
prohibited in a given district by the Zoning Ordinance.
- To decide on other matters where a decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals may be
specifically required by the provisions of this Ordinance. In exercising these powers, the
Board of Zoning Appeals may be reversed or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the
order, requirements, decision, or determination, and to that end shall have all the
powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the

within the work area from which cut, in such a way as not to be objectionable to the property
owner. On developed property, remove all such clearing waste and properly dispose of it offsite.
END SECTION 02112
SECTION 02204 - TRENCHING AND BACKFILLING
PART l - GENERAL
DESCRIPTION OF WORK:
Trenching and backfilling operations include, but are not limited to, all earthwork associated
with installation, modification, or abandonment of underground utilities and appurtenances,
and restoration of damaged improvements and disturbed surfaces. The work also includes
installation and maintenance erosion and sediment control measures for all disturbed areas.
Related work specified elsewhere includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Route Clearing, Section 02112
QUALITY ASSURANCE:
Codes and Standards: Perform trenching and backfilling work in compliance with applicable
requirements of governing authorities having jurisdiction where such requirements exceed
those specified in this section.
Sampling and Testing:
Provide quality control testing during construction as necessary to assure the entire earthwork
including all fill layers, subgrades, and bases meets contract requirements. Remove and
reconstruct, or otherwise correct work which falls below specified density or is outside other
specified limits.
Employ, at Contractors expense, an independent testing laboratory to perform quality
control testing during trenching and backfilling operations.
The City may perform sampling, surveying, inspection or testing activity during construction for
its use, but such activity does not relieve the Contractor from responsibility to achieve specified
results.
SUBMITTALS:
Quality Control Testing Reports: After completing utility earthwork construction and prior to
acceptance by the City, the Contractor must file a copy of quality control test results
demonstrating compliance with these specifications with the City. At any time during the
construction process, representatives of the City may request to review and the Contractor shall
provide quality control test results.
SITE INFORMATION:
Verify existing site grades to be substantially consistent with grades shown on the drawings
before commencing work. Report any significant conflict in grades to the design engineer of
record before proceeding.
Subsurface conditions presented, if any, are not intended as representations or warrants of
continuity of such conditions between soil borings or pits. It is expressly understood that the
Contractor is solely responsible for interpretations or conclusions drawn therefrom. Data are
made available for the convenience of the Contractor who may, without cost to the City,
perform additional test borings and other exploratory operations, provided such operations are
acceptable to the City.
Existing Utilities: Locate all existing underground utilities in the areas of work including
verification of nature and exact location of any utility indicated on drawings. If utilities are to
remain in place, provide adequate means of protection during earthwork operations.
Should unexpected piping or other utilities be encountered during excavation, consult the
utility owner immediately for directions. Cooperate with the City and utility companies in
keeping respective services and facilities in operation. Repair damaged utilities to satisfaction of
utility owner.
Do not interrupt existing utilities serving existing facilities except when permitted in writing by
the City and then only within time periods acceptable to the City.
Demolish and completely remove from site existing underground utilities indicated to be
removed. Coordinate with utility companies for shut-off of services if lines are active.
Traffic Control: Schedule and conduct Work in a manner which will minimize inconvenience to
vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Provide flaggers, barricades, warning signs, warning lights, and
other warning means as appropriate. When flaggers are utilized, individuals must hold a valid
Georgia DOT flagging certificate. Maintain traffic on all roads and streets which must be crossed
by trenching and making two separate cuts so that at least one traffic lane is open at all times.
All traffic controls during construction must conform to Part VI of the Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices.
PART 2 - PRODUCTS
Not applicable to work in this Section.
PART 3 - EXECUTION
PROTECTION OF PERSONS AND PROPERTY:
Utility Locator Service: Before commencing any trenching, other excavation or related work,
notify the Utilities Protection Center Call Before You Dig telephone number 770-623-4344 to
permit marking existing utilities on the ground in advance of the work. Do not begin any
such work until the required utility marking time has passed.
Do not commence trenching and backfilling operations until temporary erosion and sediment
control measures are in place.
When ever land disturbing activities are being conducted, Contractor shall have a Georgia Soil
and Water Conservation Commission Level 1A certified representative at the site of the land
disturbing activities who shall have responsible charge of erosion and sediment control
measures.
Barricade open excavations and post warning lights for safety of persons. Operate warning
lights during hours from dusk to dawn each day.
Protect structures, utilities, sidewalks, pavements, and other facilities immediately adjacent to
excavations, from damage caused by settlement, lateral movement, undermining, washout and
other hazards.
Take precautions and provide necessary bracing and shoring to guard against movement or
settlement of existing improvements or new construction. Contractor is entirely responsible for
strength and adequacy of bracing and shoring, and for safety and support of construction from
damage or injury caused by the lack thereof or by movement or settlement.
Use work methods and provide temporary facilities as necessary to prevent washing, erosion,
siltation or dust damage, or hazard to persons and property, within and outside the work area.
Place excavated material compactly alongside of the trench, and keep such material trimmed
up so as to present the least practicable inconvenience to the public. Where necessitated by
traffic conditions, remove from the roadway the first material excavated from a working length
of trench so that further excavation is immediately used for backfilling, and thereby avoid
stockpiling of material upon the roadway. Afterward, return first excavated material if needed
for final backfilling.
Maintain all streets, sidewalks, pedestrian crossings, fire hydrants, water and gas valves, and
other utilities accessible for their intended use except while the work is steadily advancing in the
immediate vicinity of each such facility.
Keep every drain, gutter, culvert, sewer, and surface drainage route encountered, open for both
temporary and permanent flow unless other effective provision for drainage is made.
Do not permit any hazardous condition to result from trenching and backfilling operations.
USE OF EXPLOSIVES:
Do not bring explosives onto site or use in work without prior written permission from
authorities having jurisdiction.
Use explosives only as legally permitted and when other work methods are impractical.
Do not permit explosives on the project site other than during the least practicable use period.
Assume sole responsibility for handling, storage, and use of any explosive materials.
TRENCHING:
Trenching consists of removal and disposal of material encountered to obtain required
subgrade elevations, usually, but not necessarily limited to that incidental to installation or
modification of underground pipelines and appurtenances.
Unauthorized trenching consists of removal of materials beyond indicated subgrade elevations
or dimensions without specific authorization of the City.
Rock excavation consists of removal and disposal of natural material encountered that cannot
be excavated without continuous and systematic drilling and blasting or continuous use of a
ripper or other special equipment. Intermittent drilling or blasting performed to increase
production and unnecessary for excavation of material encountered will not be classified as
rock excavation.
Stability of Excavation: Slope sides of excavations to comply with Subpart P of Part 1926 of the
Occupational Safety and Health Act as amended. Shore and brace or use trench box where
sloping is not possible either because of space restrictions or stability of material excavated.
Maintain sides and slopes of excavations in a safe condition until completion of backfilling.
Shoring and Bracing: Provide portable trench boxes and materials for shoring and bracing, such
as sheet piling, uprights, stringers and cross-braces, in good serviceable condition.
Maintain shoring and bracing and/or portable trench boxes in excavations regardless of time
period excavations will be open. Carry down shoring and bracing as excavation progresses.
Provide trench boxes and/or shoring and bracing to comply with Subpart P of Part 1926 of the
Occupational Safety and Health Act as amended.
Dewatering: Perform earthwork in a manner to prevent surface water and minimize subsurface
or ground water from flowing into excavations, and to prevent water from flooding project
work and surrounding area.
Do not allow water to accumulate in excavations. Remove water using dewatering methods
which will prevent softening of foundation bottoms, undercutting footings, and soil changes
detrimental to stability of subgrades and foundations. Provide and maintain pumps, sumps,
suction and discharge lines, and other dewatering system components necessary to convey
water away from excavations.
Limit opening of additional trench length to that which can be dewatered with available
equipment or methods.
Do not use trench as temporary drainage ditch.
Material Storage: Locate and retain materials away from edge of trench.
Dispose of excess soil material and waste materials, such as unsatisfactory excavated soil
material, trash and debris, as specified hereinafter.
Excavating: Do not extend excavation below or wider than that which is necessary to construct
work except as otherwise provided herein. Repair any unauthorized trenching as necessary to
obtain an adequate subgrade.
Limit open trench excavation to a maximum of 300 feet ahead of completed backfill.
Where specific utility system elevations or depths are indicated on the drawings or elsewhere
herein, accurately conform with such requirements. Otherwise, achieve a minimum earth
and/or pavement cover of 30 inches above top of underground utilities being constructed
unless a greater cover is made necessary by easement or permit requirement, by maintaining a
minimum clearance of 18 inches below any existing or proposed structure or channel, or by
achieving proper alignment with existing or proposed facilities.
Maintain a horizontal separation of at least 10 feet between sanitary sewers and any existing or
proposed water main. A sewer may be laid closer than 10 feet to a water main if it is laid in a
separate trench.
Maintain a vertical separation of at least 18 inches between the crown of sanitary sewers and
the invert of existing or proposed water mains with the sewer located below the water main.
Where a vertical separation of 18 inches cannot be provided and the water main cannot be
relocated to provide adequate clearance, center one full length of water main over the sewer so
that both joints of the water main will be as far from the sewer as possible.
Confine trench width from an elevation of one foot above top of underground pipe to the
trench bottom, to that minimum which is necessary to pipe laying operations, but do not
exceed maximum trench width determined by pipe foundation requirements.
Remove rock, masonry and concrete material to a distance of at least six inches from all parts of
pipe and appurtenances being installed. Backfill and thoroughly compact to proper trench
bottom elevation with select excavated material.
Do not mix excavated rock, masonry or concrete with backfill material placed within two feet of
installed pipe, or within one foot of finished grade.
Pavement Removal: Remove all pavement, including curb and gutter, sidewalk and the like,
which must be disturbed by trenching operations.
Saw cut edges of bituminous pavement. For concrete pavement, saw cut edges or remove and
replace to nearest joint.
At sidewalks, curbs and gutters, and the like, remove entire width of damaged sections.
Extend pavement removal to the width required to accomplish trenching operations without
damage to edge of remaining pavement. Correct any edge damage which occurs as requested
by the City.
Removal of Unsatisfactory Soil Materials: To the extent authorized, over-excavate those soil
materials which are unsatisfactory in the opinion of the City and backfill with approved
materials.
COMPACTION:
General: Control soil compaction during construction providing minimum percentage of
density specified for each area classification.
Percentage of Maximum Density Requirements: Achieve not less than the following
percentages of maximum density of soil material compacted at optimum moisture content, for
each layer of soil material-in-place as determined by ASTM D 698 (Standard Proctor) test
procedures:
Rights-of-Way: Conform with the more stringent requirements of the permit issuing
authority and the requirements herein.
Roadways: Under and within five feet horizontal distance of traffic using surfaces,
compact each layer of backfill and fill material to 95 percent of maximum dry density.
Walkways: Under and within two feet horizontal distance of paved walks, compact top
six inches of subgrade and each layer of backfill and fill material to 95 percent of
maximum dry density.
Driveways and Parking Lots: Under and within two feet horizontal distance of traffic
using surfaces, compact each layer of backfill and fill material to 95 percent of maximum
dry density.
Lawn or Unpaved Areas: Compact each layer of backfill or fill material to 85 percent of
maximum dry density.
Spoil Areas: Compact each layer of backfill or fill material to 85 percent of maximum dry
density.
Moisture Control: Where a layer of soil material is too dry to achieve required compaction,
uniformly apply water to layer as necessary to bring moisture within limits which permit
compaction to at least the specified densities.
Remove, dry and replace, or scarify and air dry in place, soil material that is too wet to achieve
required compaction.
BACKFILL AND FILL:
General: Place acceptable soil material in uniform layers, to required elevations. Backfill
excavations as promptly as work permits.
Backfill and Fill Materials: Use acceptable trench excavated soil material, free of stumps, trees,
roots, muck, trash and other objectionable matter.
Placement and Compaction: Place backfill and fill materials in layers not more than eight inches
in loose depth. Before compaction, moisten or aerate each layer as necessary to provide the
optimum moisture content. Compact each layer to required percentage of maximum density
for each area classification. Do not place backfill or fill material on surfaces that are muddy,
frozen, or contain frost or ice.
Commence backfill and fill operations close behind utility laying operations. Take care to
prevent wedging action of backfill or fill against structures by carrying the material uniformly
around structure to approximately same elevation in each lift.
GRADING:
General: Uniformly grade areas within limits of earthwork, including adjacent transition areas.
Smooth and compact finished surface within specified tolerances, with uniform levels or slopes
between points where elevations are shown, or between such points and existing grades, or
between existing grades.
Grading Outside Structures: Grade finished areas adjacent to structures to drain away from
structures (except drainage inlets), and to prevent ponding. Finish surfaces free from irregular
surface changes, and as follows:
Grassed or Landscaped Areas: Finish areas to within not more than 0.10 feet above or
below the required elevations.
Walks and Pavements: Shape surface of areas under walks and pavements to line, grade
and cross-section, with finish surface not more than ½ inch above or below the required
subgrade elevation.
Compaction: After grading, compact subgrade surfaces to the depth and percentage of
maximum density for each area classification.
RIP RAP SURFACE STABILIZATION:
General:
Prior to placing rip rap, bring ground surface to correct line and grades. Provide rip rap at all
stream crossings, and/or at locations indicated on drawings or requested by the City.
Stone Rip Rap:
Hand place stone rip rap into final position to form a compact layer not less than six inches
in-place thickness. Use well graded stone sizes to eliminate void spaces between stones. Place
stones neatly and anchor units to be free of tendency to slip out of position. Place rip rap so
that no more than three inches variation exists above or below the required plane.
MAINTENANCE:
Protection of Graded Areas: Protect newly graded areas from traffic and erosion, and keep free
of trash and debris.
Repair and re-establish grades in settled, eroded, and rutted areas to specified compaction and
tolerances.
Reconditioning Compacted Areas: Where completed compacted areas are disturbed by
subsequent construction, adverse weather, traffic, or other cause, scarify surface, re-shape, and
compact to required density prior to further construction.
Maintain temporary erosion and sediment control measures until permanent measures become
effective.
DISPOSAL OF EXCESS AND WASTE MATERIALS:
Disposal of Excess Excavation: Transport excess excavated material, including unsatisfactory soil
material, to any designated spoil areas, and spread as specified; otherwise remove from the
project work area and legally dispose of such material which cannot be acceptably distributed
within project work area.
Disposal of Waste Material: Remove trash, debris, and waste materials from the project work
area and legally dispose of such material.
RESTORATION:
Plan and execute total work so as to minimize damage to property. Restore all surface materials,
shrubbery, fences, lawns, walls, structures and other improvements to a condition no less
desirable than that which existed before construction operations began.
Conduct all construction operations such that upon completion of any part of the work, the
contour and topography of the construction area has not been substantially altered. No
alteration of previously established storm drainage patterns will be permitted unless such
alteration can be proven to the Citys satisfaction to substantially improve the drainage pattern.
Where necessary to temporarily remove or damage improvements of any significance, take
professional quality photographs of such improvements before disturbing them. Make copies
of such photographs available to the City on request.
Restore work area and accomplish site cleanup immediately after backfilling and fill operations.
Replace property line monuments which were damaged, removed or disturbed by trenching
and backfilling operations. Employ, at Contractors expense, a Georgia registered land surveyor
for all property line monument replacement.

PART 3 - EXECUTION
GENERAL:
Carry out Work in a safe manner, taking all necessary precautions and measures necessary to
maintain a stable construction system which does not weaken existing earth or structures nor
cause settlement of the overpassing roadway or railway section.
When tunneling operations are carried out under railroad tracks, highways, streets, or any
other existing thoroughfare, perform operations in such manner as not to interfere with nor
in any way endanger the normal operation of such thoroughfares.
Complete all tunneling work at one particular location before starting work at another
location.
EXCAVATION:
The following requirements are supplemental to Section 02204, Trenching and Backfilling, of
these specifications.
Maintain temporary erosion and sediment control measures until permanent measures become
effective.
When required, excavate suitable pits or trenches for tunneling operations. Provide all
necessary bracing, sheeting and/or other temporary means to insure safety of persons and
property. Comply with Subpart P of Part 1926 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act as
amended.
Maintain excavation free from water, mud and debris which will interfere with an efficient
tunneling operation. Neatly dry-excavate material of whatever nature encountered within
the tunnel. Do not use sluicing or jetting excavation techniques.
Limit excavation to the minimum diameter required for tunnel liner installation.
Pressure grout all excessive voids which may develop about the tunnel liner exterior.
Promptly backfill all pits and trenches.
JACKING:
When installing tunnel liner by jacking method, use guide rails or other jacking frame
structure to effectively maintain tunnel liner at proper line and grade. Force tunnel liner into
place with suitable jacks which apply uniform pressure around the tunnel liner end section.
Excavate at the lead end of the tunnel as the jacking operation progresses, but do not
excavate more than two feet in front of tunnel liner. Reduce the two feet distance where
material character results in excess loss of soil. Remove excavated material through the
tunnel liner. Once jacking is begun, continue operation without interruption to prevent the
pipe from becoming firmly set in the embankment.
Perform tunneling such that the final tunnel liner position is within the following limits:
Lateral Alignment: Within two percent of tunnel liner length.
Vertical Elevation: Within one percent of tunnel liner vertical grade, provided that the
final grade of flow line is in the direction indicated on the drawings.
BORING:
Mechanically bore by use of a cutting head on a continuous auger. Install tunnel liner in hole
by jacking or other suitable methods. Accomplish boring of hole and tunnel liner installation
simultaneously. Do not permit boring to proceed more than one foot in front of tunnel liner.
At Contractors option and to minimize abandoned tunnel liner, conduct initial boring using a
pilot hole approximately two inches in diameter for the entire installation length. Verify
required line and grade and use pilot hole as the center line of the larger hole to be bored. If
rock is encountered in pilot hole, withdraw equipment and relocate tunnel location. Conduct
pilot hole installation in revised location and repeat procedure. No extra payment will be
considered for installations that encounter rock and must be abandoned.
Perform tunneling such that the final tunnel liner position is within the following limits:
Lateral Alignment: Within two percent of tunnel liner length.
Vertical Elevation: Within one percent of tunnel liner vertical grade, provided that the
final grade of flow line is in the direction indicated on the drawings.
ABANDONMENT:
Should it become necessary to abandon a tunnel for any reason, pressure grout the
abandoned hole to prevent damage to surrounding earth and structures. When the tunnel
liner is retained, fill entire tunnel with grout and pressure grout any voids about the tunnel
liner exterior.
TUNNEL LOCATIONS:
Locate tunnels as indicated on the drawings or by the City.
To facilitate construction, changes in tunnel location may be permitted. Proposed changes
must be submitted by the Contractor. Changes in location must be acceptable to the City,
and any utility company or public agency having jurisdiction over the location.
END SEALS:
Seal ends of tunnel liner to prevent debris and moisture from entering the annular space
between the carrier pipe and tunnel liner.

of valve box concentric with valve operating stem. Avoid contact at lower end of valve box
with valve body or pipe.
ANCHORAGE:
General:
Anchorage detailed on drawings, if any, represents minimum anchorage to be installed. Field
or operating conditions may require additional anchorage, and it is the Contractors
responsibility to recognize such additional requirements and to provide appropriate
additional anchorage.
Non-direct Burial Locations:
Place hangers, anchors and other supports as required to prevent excessive sagging or undue
strain on joints or equipment. Use factory fabricated hangers only, sized amply for imposed
loads.
Provide effective anchorage for all pressure piping as necessary to resist thrust caused by
unbalanced pressure, giving due allowance for test pressures and water hammer.
Install hangers and support in accordance with MSS SP-69 and SP-80.
Direct Burial Locations:
Anchor all bends, valves, tees, fire hydrants, reducers and other points of unbalanced
pressure as necessary to resist thrust at test and working pressures, with suitable allowance
for water-hammer. Also anchor piping system installed on steep slopes where gravitational
force might otherwise cause piping displacement. Accomplish piping system anchorage by
use of concrete reaction bracing, metal tie rods and bands, and/or restrained joint systems.
When using concrete reaction bracing, pour concrete against firm earth and allow it to cure
for at least five days before placing main under pressure. Position concrete blocks of
sufficient size to counteract the magnitude and direction of the resultant thrust force.
Accomplish fire hydrant assembly anchorage by use of metal tie rods and bands and/or
restrained joint systems. Keep joints and hydrant drain openings clear and accessible.
Provide special support blocks at plastic pipes according to manufacturer's recommendation.
When using bands and tie rods in conjunction with reaction bracing, provide a separate band
for each tie rod. Use corrosion resistant materials throughout. When using restrained joint
systems, utilize methods and place these special joints at appropriate fittings and pipe joints
in accordance with manufacturers recommendation.
SPECIAL CONSTRUCTION:
Where constructing on piers, supporting pipe on bridges, or for other special work, use safe
and generally accepted construction methods to accomplish the required work.
SERVICE SADDLES:
Cast Iron and Ductile Iron Mains:
Install ¾ and one inch size corporation stops directly into tapped holes in water main. Use
service saddles for all taps larger than one inch size.
PVC Mains:
Use service saddles for all service taps.
PIPE DETECTION TAPE:
Install pipe detection tape in trench, approximately two feet above pipe. Provide pipe
detection tape for all non-ferrous water mains unless otherwise directed by the City.
LINE CLEANING:
Avoid permitting dirt, rubbish, construction materials, etc. to enter lines and appurtenances
during construction. Use whatever means are necessary to obtain a clean and internally
smooth system prior to final acceptance.
Limit use of flushing water to rates and quantities which will not interfere with service to
water customers.
WATER LEAKAGE:
General Leakage Requirements:
Make entire water line system as near watertight as practicable. Eliminate all detectable
leakage regardless of test results hereinafter required.
Testing:
Furnish and use appropriate test equipment and methods. Include gage, meter, pump and
connections.
Bleed all air from system prior to testing, providing any necessary corporation stops and
piping installations.
Pressure test all elements of the piping system. Where piping is buried or otherwise
concealed, maintain the pressure test for not less than six hours. Visible piping may be tested
for a lesser time period, if approved by the City. Conduct pressure testing at 200 psig unless a
lower pressure is recommended by a manufacturer of an element of the system. When a
manufacturer does recommend a lower test pressure, furnish the City with a detailed written
explanation before commencing test work. In no event may the lower test pressure be less
than 110 percent of the nominal working pressure of the pipe comprising the system.
Measure pressure for testing referred to the elevational datum of the lowest pipe of the line
section being tested.
Where possible, use methods and perform construction work in such sequence as necessary
to accomplish pressure testing as work progresses. Do not pressure test more than a one
mile length of pipe at one time. Provide temporary piping and accessories if required to
isolate test sections.
Makeup water required to maintain test pressure in gallons per hour per l,000 feet of pipe
under test, over the test period may not exceed the quantities shown in the following table:
Pipe Size Quantity Pipe Size Quantity
Inches Gal. per Hour Inches Gal. per Hour
2 0.16 16 1.26
3 0.24 18 1.42
4 0.32 20 1.58
6 0.47 24 1.89
8 0.63 30 2.37
10 0.79 36 2.84
12 0.95 42 3.31
14 1.10 48 3.79
Repair all breaks, detectable leaks or other defects and retest as many times as necessary to
obtain passing test.
DISINFECTING:
Chlorinate all potable water lines on completion of construction, after flushing and prior to
placing in service. Use precaution to prevent backflow to supply system. Comply with
AWWA C651, including Section 9 procedures on final connections to existing mains. At
Contractors option, accomplish chlorination by the tablet method, the continuous feed
method or the slug method.
Fill lines with potable water containing sufficient chlorine to show a chlorine dose of at best
25 mg/l for the tablet method, a 10 mg/l minimum residual at the end of 24 hours retention
period for the continuous feed method, or a 50 mg/l minimum residual at the end of three
hours of exposure for the slug method.
Provide and operate all equipment and provide all materials necessary for disinfecting water
mains. Draw off at taps and hydrants along the line until a DPD test or approved chlorine test
kit shows a strong indication of residual chlorine.
Retain chlorinated water in the system for a period of twenty-four (24) hours for either tablet
method or continuous feed method. Test for specified residual. If residual is as specified or
greater, flush the system with potable water, otherwise repeat entire procedure until
satisfactory results are obtained. If the slug method of disinfection is used, dispose of heavily
chlorinated water in a manner acceptable to Federal, state and local environmental
regulatory agencies.
Demonstrate lines to be free of contamination by drawing samples therefrom on two
successive days in the presence of the City. Deliver samples to a qualified laboratory for
examination. On receipt of satisfactory test report from the foregoing laboratory, and with
the approval of the City, the lines so tested are to be considered free of contamination and
placed in service. In the event contamination persists, resterilize as necessary until receipt of
satisfactory test report. All costs of disinfecting and bacteriological tests are to be paid by the
Contractor.

PIPE LAYING:
Clean interior of pipe and all joints before laying. When pipe laying activity is not in actual
progress, tightly cover open ends of sewer. Avoid permitting mud or other material from
entering sewer at all times.
Avoid damage or shock in handling pipe and accessories. Inspect each length of pipe, and
reject any defective piece. Carefully protect pipe in place from damage or displacement until
backfilling operations are complete.
Lay and joint pipe in strict conformance with manufacturers written recommendations as
submitted to and accepted by the City. Lay all pipe upgrade with spigots pointing
downgrade.
Control geometric position of pipe as necessary to ensure that pipe and fittings accurately
conform with required grade and alignment after sewer is completed.
Prevent water from accumulating or running in trench during pipe laying operations, and
until the trench or excavation has been backfilled.
Remove and re-lay any length of pipe which does not accurately conform with required line
or grade, is crushed, or is excessively deflected.
Install piping with 48 inches minimum cover depth. Where cover depth less than 48 inches is
unavoidable, provide ductile iron pipe material for segments having less than 48 inches of
cover depth.
Maintain a vertical separation of at least 18 inches between the crown of sanitary sewers and
the invert of existing or proposed water mains with the sewer located below the water main.
When a vertical separation of 18 inches cannot be provided and the water main cannot be
relocated to provide adequate clearance, utilize one full length of ductile iron pipe for sewer
construction such that the pipe length is centered on the water main.
PIPE CONNECTIONS:
Make all pipe connections with standard fittings, manholes, structures, or special construction
detailed on drawings. Locate building services and connect thereto with standard fittings as
authorized.
At manholes and structures, neatly cut all connecting pipe flush with inside surface, and
provide flexible pipe joint within 18 inches of outer surface. Make pipe connections to
manholes and structures by laying pipe in mortar bed or concrete. Use supplemental
materials and techniques as required to obtain watertightness.
Do not connect any sewage flow to new work until authorized by the City.
INSTALLING SANITARY SEWER IN TUNNEL LINER:
Tunnel Liner, 6 Inches to 42 Inches:

Conform with applicable provisions of the following sections:
Sewer Structures and Accessories, Section 02776
WYES, TEES AND SERVICES:
Provide wyes and/or service tees at points indicated on drawings, specified herein, and as
requested by the City. If wyes or service extensions are not to be connected to a building
sewer under this work, close end of pipe with removable factory fabricated plug or stopper.
When replacing an existing sewer, connect all existing service lines to the new sewer.
Service lines, unless otherwise shown on the drawings or requested by the City, are to be run
to suit field conditions at a minimum grade of two percent and with a minimum pipe cover of
30 inches.
Provide cleanouts in service lines at not more than 75 foot intervals and where pipe
horizontal deflection exceeds 45 degrees. Unless noted otherwise, furnish cleanouts
consisting of wye and 45 degree fittings, vertical pipe and threaded brass or plastic removal
plug. Arrange cleanout to permit cleaning in the direction of flow.
PIPE DETECTION TAPE AND WIRE:
Install pipe detection tape in trench, approximately two feet above pipe. Install continuous,
uncut pipe detection wire in trench, approximately six inches above pipe. At manholes
provide at least 36 inches of coiled wire from each direction placed in the manhole. At pipe
terminations, tape wire to pipe and carry ends to above grade near pipe for future use by
maintenance personnel. Provide pipe detection tape and wire for all non-ferrous sanitary
sewers, unless otherwise noted. Install detection tape and wire so that sewer line can be
located with a pipe detector after burial.
LINE CLEANING:
Avoid permitting dirt, rubbish, surplus construction material, and other foreign matter to
enter structures or pipe during construction. Use whatever means may be necessary to
obtain a clean and internally smooth sewer system prior to final acceptance.
FIELD QUALITY CONTROL:
General Leakage Requirements:
Make entire sewer line system as near watertight as practicable. Eliminate all visible points of
ground water infiltration, and any other significant points of leakage which can be located,
regardless of test results obtained as hereinafter required.
Upon completion of pipe installation and trench backfilling to within one foot of finished
grade, perform system installation acceptance tests using infiltration or exfiltration testing for
all piping with a visible flow of water and piping or joint low pressure air testing for all work
constructed. Conduct final acceptance test witnessed by the City.
Installation acceptance testing is required on all new sewer line segments extending
completely from manhole to manhole unless waived by the City due to unreasonable service
shutdown demands.
An acceptable low pressure air test is interpreted as an installation acceptance test in lieu of
infiltration or exfiltration testing of pipelines only where flow of water is not visible in the
pipe.
Take whatever action may be necessary to permanently reduce infiltration from all water
sources to less than the maximum allowable leakage limits established below for all
constructed work.
System Exfiltration or Infiltration Acceptance Testing:
Infiltration testing is only applicable if the ground water table is at least two feet above the
crown of the new sewer pipeline being tested. Exfiltration testing will be used when the
ground water table is less than two feet above the crown of the new sewer. Perform
infiltration or exfiltration acceptance testing in accordance with ASTM C 1091 or ASTM C 969
guidelines for new sewers using the following general procedures:
Plug the upper (inlet) end of the test section including laterals.
At the lower (outlet) end, collect the water and measure the quantity collected within
a specific time in a calibrated container after a constant flow is generated at the pipe
section outlet.
An alternate measurement method is to use a calibrated weir installed at the outlet.
System Exfiltration Testing:
The maximum allowable leakage is 25 gallons/(inch of internal diameter)(mile of sewer)(day)
when the average head of the test section is three feet or less. When the average head on the
test section is greater than three feet, the allowable leakage shall be multiplied by the ratio of
the square root of the average test head over the square root of the base head of three feet.
System Infiltration Testing:
The maximum allowable leakage limit is 25 gallons/(inch of internal diameter)(mile of
sewer)(day) when the average head on the test section is six feet or less. When the average
groundwater head on the test section is greater than six feet, the allowable leakage shall be
increased in proportion to the ratio of the square root of the average groundwater head over
the square root of the base head of six feet.
Air Testing:
Nominal 4 Inch to 24 Inch Pipe: After completing backfill of a sewer line section, conduct a
low pressure air test depending on pipe material in accordance with ASTM C 924, ASTM C 828,
ASTM F 1417, or UNI-B-6 guidelines for installation acceptance. Ductile iron pipelines shall be
tested in accordance with ASTM F 1417 or UNI-B-6 requirements. Perform such tests using
the following general procedures:
Temporarily plug line segment between two manholes using plugs having air tight
fittings through which low pressure air can be introduced into the pipe segment being
tested.
Introduce low pressure air into the test pipe segment until the internal air pressure
reaches four psig above ground water pressure, if any.
Wait at least two minutes for air temperature in the test segment to stabilize while
internal air pressure remains no less than 3.5 psig above ground water pressure.
Accurately determine the elapsed time for internal pressure to drop one psig.
The air test is acceptable if elapsed time for an internal pressure drop of one psig is no less
than shown in the following tables:
For Concrete Sewer Lines:
Pipe Diameter Seconds Per
Inches 100 Feet of Pipe
15 126
18 144
Air leakage time is based on pipe being damp. If pipe and joints are dry, dampen line if
helpful in meeting air test time requirement.
For Thermoplastic or Ductile Iron Sewer Lines:

15 14:10 159 5.342 L
18 17:00 133 7.692 L
Deflection Testing:
Conduct internal deflection testing on all installed gravity sewer lines six inch size and larger,
no sooner than 30 days after completion of trench backfilling and after pipeline is completely
cleaned and flushed. Deflection testing consists of pulling an approved solid pointed
mandrel through the completed pipeline from manhole to manhole without using
mechanical pulling devices. Mandrel testing is successful when the mandrel device can be
pulled through the pipe between manholes in a continuous operation, without interruption.
Repair or replace all defective pipe found during mandrel testing and conduct another
deflection test to determine the extent and necessary repair of any additional deficiencies.
After repairing all defects, perform successful mandrel testing no less than 30 days after
completion of trench backfilling in the presence of the City.
Use a rigid, non-adjustable mandrel with odd number of legs or runners (not less than nine
legs) and a length at least 75 percent of the inside diameter of the pipe being tested. Furnish
mandrels sized as tabulated below using base inside diameters complying with ASTM D 3034
and F 679:
5 PERCENT DEFLECTION MANDREL

15 13.20 0.01 13-3/16
18 16.13 0.01 16-2/16
Upon request by the City, certify the accuracy of the mandrel test gauges by sliding proving
rings to an accuracy of 0.05 inches over the mandrel. Use proving rings complying with ASTM
F 679 and ASTM D 3034.
Internal Television Inspection:
Conduct internal television inspection on all installed gravity sewer lines eight inch size and
larger, after trench backfilling to within one foot of finished grade. Repair or replace all visible
defects found and conduct another internal television inspection to determine the extent and
necessary repair of any additional deficiencies. Repeat the inspection and correction process
until the entire work shall be free from any visible defects. After repairing all visible defects,
perform successful air test on each sewer segment before conducting final television
inspection for the record. Provide City with color VHS format video record tapes and
supporting written location records of the final condition of each completed and tested
sewer segment.

Trench depth is the vertical distance from pipe invert or flow line to finished ground surface.
Trench width is the horizontal distance between trench walls at any point from one foot
above top of pipe to trench bottom.
Class B Bedding may be achieved by either of the following two construction methods.
(l) Shaped Bottom with Tamped Backfill: Shape bottom of trench excavation to conform to a
cylindrical surface with a radius at least two inches greater than the radius to the outside of
the pipe and with a width sufficient to allow six-tenths of the width of the pipe barrel to be
bedded in fine granular material fill placed in the shaped excavation. Carefully place and
compact backfill at sides of pipe to a thickness of at least 12 inches above top of pipe. Limit
use of this bedding method to trenches with firm bottom and sides.
(2) Compacted Coarse Granular Bedding With Tamped Backfill: Bed pipe in compacted coarse
granular material placed on a flat trench bottom. Thickness of granular bedding must be at
least one-fourth the outside pipe diameter, but not less than four inches thick under pipe
barrel, and extend at least halfway up the pipe barrel at the sides. Carefully place compacted
backfill above the granular material up a minimum depth of 12 inches over the top of pipe.
Class C Bedding may be achieved by either of the following two construction methods:
(l) Shaped Bottom: Bed pipe with ordinary care in an earth foundation formed in the trench
bottom by a shaped excavation which fits the pipe barrel with reasonable closeness for a
width of at least 50 percent of the outside pipe diameter. Place compacted fill to a minimum
depth of six inches above top of pipe.
(2) Compacted Coarse Granular Bedding with a Tamped Backfill: Bed pipe in compacted
granular material placed on a flat trench bottom. Thickness of granular material must be at
least 4 inches under the barrel and must extend one-tenth to one-sixth of the outside
diameter up the pipe barrel at the sides. Place compacted backfill above the granular
material to a minimum depth of six inches over top of pipe.
PIPE LAYING:
Clean interior of pipe and all joints before laying. When pipe laying activity is not in actual
progress, tightly cover open ends of sewer. Avoid permitting mud or other material from
entering sewer at all times.
Avoid damage or shock in handling pipe and accessories. Inspect each length of pipe, and
reject any defective piece. Carefully protect pipe in place from damage or displacement until
backfilling operations are complete.
Lay and joint pipe in strict conformance with manufacturers written recommendations as
submitted to an accepted by the City. Where cement joints are used, provide wet burlap or
earth protective cover for joints immediately after initial grout set. Maintain protective cover
until joint is covered by backfilling. Lay all pipe upgrade with spigots pointing downgrade.
Control geometric position of pipe as necessary to ensure that pipe and fittings accurately
conform with required grade and alignment after sewer is completed.
Prevent water from accumulating or running in trench during pipe laying operations, and
until the trench or excavation has been backfilled.
Remove and re-lay any length of pipe which does not accurately conform with required line
or grade, is crushed, or is excessively deflected.
PIPE CONNECTIONS:
Make all pipe connections with standard fittings, or special construction detailed on
drawings.
At manholes and structures, neatly cut all connecting pipe flush with inside surface, and
provide flexible pipe joint within 18 inches of outer surface. Make pipe connections to
manholes and structures by laying pipe in mortar bed or concrete. Use supplemental
materials and techniques as required to obtain watertightness.
Do not connect any flow to new work until authorized by the City.

is available, otherwise follow same procedures as specified for tunnel liner, 6 inches to 42
inches.
Insert sewer pipe into tunnel liner after having grouted bottom of tunnel to exact grade
required to support pipe in proper position.
Permanently secure sewer pipe in position by blocking each pipe length at top and sides with
brick and mortar, followed by bedding sewer pipe to a depth equal to one-fourth the pipe
outside diameter, with concrete.
Plug ends of tunnel with 12 inch thickness of masonry, leaving weep holes at lower end of
tunnel.

City of
Union City, Georgia
Prepared by

APRIL 1995
INTRODUCTION
As the use and character of land changes due to the growth of Union City, it is important to
recognize the adverse effects those changes can have on natural and man-made systems.
Applying reasonable solutions project by project is much easier and more cost effective than
ignoring negative impacts until they become monumental problems.
Drainage affords an excellent example of this point. Up until the early 1970's, urban growth
was accomplished without consideration that storm water runoff and soil erosion were
dramatically increased by development. The result of this approach was often heavy siltation
and flooding. Even though modern detention and erosion control regulations have eased the
problems, many cities still suffer drainage woes stemming from years of poor storm water
management.
The purpose of this manual is to establish criteria for dealing with drainage for all projects
within the City of Union City. Set forth herein are policies, methods and techniques to be
used in developing drainage improvements on a consistent basis throughout the City.
It must be recognized that this manual is not intended to be a complete reference on
drainage nor is it expected to cover every situation which may arise. The manual is to serve as
a guide to engineers versed in drainage analysis and design. Unique circumstances requiring
special or alternative design methods should be brought to the attention of the City early in
project life so that agreement on problem approach can be reached without impacting
project progress.
Manual users are encouraged to comment on its contents so that it may be made as useful
and applicable as possible.
CHAPTER 1
DESIGN POLICY
Hydrology
For drainage areas containing 50 acres or less, designs are to be based on the Rational
Method. Designs for areas containing more than 50 acres are to be based on a method
approved by the City Engineer for the specific basin. Normally, the Soil Conservation Service
method or the U.S.G.S. Flood Frequency Relation Method may be used.
Within the City of Union City, Georgia, the Burkli-Ziegler formula and the Talbot formula are
not considered appropriate.
Culverts and Piped Systems
1. Culverts are to be designed for a 50 year frequency flood event. The area inundated by
the design event is to be contained in a drainage easement.
2. Piped storm drainage systems are to be designed for a 25 year frequency storm event in
non-residential areas and for a 10 year frequency storm event in residential areas. Catch
basins are to be spaced so that the maximum gutter spread is six feet or less for the
design storm event.
3. The minimum pipe size to be used as a culvert or in a piped system is 15 inch diameter.
4. Under City streets, all pipe used for culverts and storm drainage systems is to be
reinforced concrete. Corrugated plastic pipe may also be used for culverts and storm
drainage systems not under City streets. Pipe class for reinforced concrete is to be
determined for actual conditions anticipated for each specific application but not less
than class III. The designer may select round pipe conforming to ASTM C76, arch pipe
conforming to ASTM C506 or elliptical pipe conforming to ASTM C507.
5. For concrete culvert and pipe systems, a roughness coefficient (Manning's n) of 0.012 is
to be used. For corrugated plastic culvert and pipe systems a roughness coefficient
(Manning's n) of 0.020 is to be used.
6. The minimum velocity in a pipe flowing full is to be 2.0 feet per second. The maximum
velocity in a pipe flowing full is to be 12.0 feet per second. The exit velocity of culvert
and pipe systems is to be controlled and modified to prevent channel erosion or scour.
7. The absolute minimum clearance between the bottom of the paving base or subbase
and the exterior crown of the storm drain pipe or culvert is to be 1.0 foot. A clearance of
2.0 feet is considered more desirable and should be achieved if possible.
Detention Facilities
1. Detention facilities are required for any project when the runoff is increased by more
than 1.0 cubic foot per second for a 10 year frequency storm event.
2. The peak release rate of storm water from a project is not to be increased from the pre
developed state for all intensities up to and including the 100 year event. Specific storm
events to be examined include the 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 year return frequency.
3. Detention facilities located on paved areas used for parking or vehicular access are
discouraged. The depth of water in a detention facility located on paved areas also used
for vehicular purposes is limited to six inches. The depth of water in a detention facility
located on paved areas also used for parking is limited to two inches.
CHAPTER 2
DATA COLLECTION
Drainage Basin Size
The size of drainage basin(s) for a project is to be determined from:
1. Field survey using conventional topographic techniques,
2. Aerial topographic maps of the project,
3. Aerial topographic maps available through Fulton County,
4. Other maps acceptable to the City.
Land Use
In drainage basins having limits beyond the boundaries of a project, land use outside the
project will be considered as either 1) the existing development or 2) natural undeveloped as
appropriate.
Soil Conditions
The soil conditions for a project are to be determined from:
1. Field survey of project site soils.
2. Soil Survey of Fulton County, Georgia
U. S. Department of Agriculture
Soil Conservation Service
Existing Storm Drains
Careful field investigation is required to locate existing storm drains which drain into or are
located within a project. Data on pipe or culvert material, size, slope, entrance and exit
conditions should be recorded. Any construction record information on existing storm drains
will be made available at City Hall through the Public Works Department. This data must be
field verified as the City cannot assure correctness or accuracy of record information.
CHAPTER 3
RATIONAL METHOD
Rational Method Formula
The rational method provides a means to relate rainfall to storm water runoff. The formula,
expressed below, gives peak runoff in cubic feet per second from a drainage basin.
Q = CIA
Q = the peak runoff in cubic feet per second.
C = a coefficient representing the ratio of runoff to rainfall.
I = the average rainfall intensity in inches per hour for a
duration equal to the time of concentration (Tc).
A = the drainage area in acres.
Runoff Coefficient
The selection of a runoff coefficient (C) is judgmental. To choose a realistic valve, the
engineer must consider soil type and moisture content, topography, land use and
imperviousness of the drainage area. Table 3-1 presents typical values which are
characteristic of the Fairburn (Palmetto, Union City) area.
Time of Concentration
The time of concentration (Tc) is the time in minutes required for runoff to flow from the most
hydraulically remote point in the drainage area to the point under investigation. It is taken as
the sum of the inlet time and the travel time. Inlet time is the time storm water is flowing
overland to the nearest pipe, channel or natural waterway. Figure 3-2, taken from the
U.S.D.A., is to be used to establish overland flow velocities for calculating inlet time.

Travel time is the time storm water is flowing a pipe, channel or natural waterway. Velocities
determined from the Manning Equation are to be used for calculating travel times.
The minimum time of concentration which can be used for any drainage basin is to be 5
minutes.
Rainfall Intensity
Intensities (I) to be used in the Rational Formula are to be selected from Figure 3-1 for the
appropriate time of concentration. This family of intensity-frequency-duration curves was
developed from Weather Bureau Technical Paper No. 25.
Drainage Area
The drainage area (A) in acres should be determined from field verified topographic maps
and/or surveys of the drainage basin.

CHAPTER 4
DETENTION FACILITIES
Design Methods
Small Drainage Areas (3 acres or less):
To determine detention requirements for small drainage areas of 3 acres or less,
the "bowstring" method may be used. By this method, storage required is equal
to the maximum difference between the total inflow (based on post development
conditions) less the total outflow (based on natural undevelopment conditions).
Example No. 2 at the end of this chapter illustrates the "bowstring" method. The
designer may also use the reservoir routing method.
Drainage Areas Over 3 Acres:
For drainage areas over 3 acres in size, the reservoir routing method is to be used
to establish detention requirements. The basic technique of this method calls for
repetitive solution to the continuity equation. The formula of the equation
utilized is:
I1 + I2 + 2S1 - 01 = 2S2 + 02
t t
Where
t = a selected time interval
I1 = inflow at the start of the time interval
O1 = outflow at the start of the time interval
S1 = storage at the start of the time interval
I2 = inflow at the end of the time interval
O2 = outflow at the end of the time interval
S2 = storage at the end of the time interval
The inflow hydrograph for the reservoir routing metered is to be developed from the
appropriate unit hydrograph on Figure 4-1.
The reservoir routing method is illustrated by Example No. 3 at the end of this chapter.

Design Storms
In determining detention design, the engineer must evaluate the 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 year
return frequency storm events. Under all events analyzed, the peak natural undeveloped
runoff is not to be exceeded. In determining the peak natural undeveloped runoff, a runoff
coefficient (c) not exceeding 0.3 must be used unless a higher coefficient can be
demonstrated by fact. All such higher values must have the written concurrence of the City
Engineer.
Emergency Overflow
Detention facilities should be suitable for storing excessive post development runoff for all
storm events through the 100 year frequency. Because, however, the 100 year event can be
exceeded and because outlet works can become partially or totally blocked, the design
engineer must provide an emergency overflow for all detention facilities. The emergency
overflow should direct flows to minimize property damage and avoid risk to people.
Freeboard
Detention facilities for sites of 2 acres or less should have a freeboard of not less than six
inches. For sites exceeding 2 acres, the freeboard should be not less than one foot.
Freeboard is defined as the difference between the detention facility water surface elevation
for the 100 year frequency storm event and the lowest elevation of the detention basin,
excluding the emergency overflow.
EXAMPLE NO. 2
Design the detention facility required to serve a 12,000 square foot neighborhood shopping
center located on a square 1.4 acre site. For purposes of this example consider only a 5 year
frequency storm. The existing site is a wooded lot.

Determine approximate storage volume required by the "bowstring" method or by:
Storage = (Qdev. - Qundev.) x 300 Tc
= (29.8 - 12.2) x 300 x 10
= 52,800 c.f.
Assume 3 foot depth
Pond area = 52,800/3
= 17,600 S.F.
Because this is approximate, select 150' x 150' pond (at mid depth) with 3 on 1 side slopes.
(Note: At this point, designer may select any type or shape storage facility).
Stage Storage Curve:
Based on storage facility, prepare a stage - storage curve.

Maximum release rate is 6.4 cfs at 80 min which is less than allowable release rate of 12.17 cfs.
The proposed design is therefore acceptable. (NOTE: At this point, engineer can 1) proceed
to verify other frequency storm events or 2) refine design to get maximum release rate closer
to allowable release rate.
CHAPTER 5
OPEN CHANNELS
Design
Improved open channels used as a part of a storm drainage system should be sized to
accommodate flows for the storm events given in Chapter 1 of this manual. Flow velocities
and depths should be determined from the Manning equation.
A channel system consist of its 1) cross section configuration, 2) horizontal alignment, 3) slope
or grade and 4) surface materials. These components must be combined so that the resulting
system prevents erosion. The actual selection of system components is left to the design
engineer.
The minimum channel conditions the design engineer must achieve are 1) not less than an
established grass lining and 2) a lined freeboard of at least 6 inches above the 10 year
frequency storm flow.
Manning "n"
For channel calculations, select the appropriate roughness coefficient from the chart at the
end of this chapter. The chart was taken from the Georgia Department of Transportation
Manual on Drainage Design for Highways.
Allowable Velocities
The maximum permissible velocities in channels lined with uniform stands of various grass
covers, are not to exceed the values given in the table on the following page. This table is
from the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia.






CHAPTER 6
CULVERTS
Design
The design of culverts in Union City is to be based on Chapters 6 and 7 of the Georgia
Department of Transportation Manual on Drainage Design for Highways.
Plan Data
Construction plans for culverts presented to the City for review should contain at least the
following data for each culvert:
1. Drainage area.
2. Design Discharge and Flood Frequency.
3. Water surface elevation at Design Discharge.
4. Culvert size and slope.
CHAPTER 7
STORM DRAINS
Inlet Spacing
Catchbasins, drop inlets and similar structures for removing storm runoff from streets are to
be spaced as necessary to keep gutter spread at or less than the maximum value identified in
Chapter 1. The procedure and design aid charts contained in Chapter 10 of the Georgia
Department of Transportation Manual on Drainage Design for Highway is an acceptable
method for use in the City of Union City.
Piped Systems
Piped storm drain systems should be designed using the Manning equation.
CHAPTER 8
SEDIMENT AND EROSION CONTROL
The control of sedimentation and erosion is an important element in the construction
process. Measures must be taken to assure that soil from construction and land clearing sites
does not pollute waterways. To accomplish this goal, the Manual for Erosion and Sediment
Control in Georgia by the State Soil & Water Conservation Committee of Georgia is
incorporated as the design guide for developing erosion and sediment control plans in the
City of Union City.

7-6 RHC Roosevelt Highway Corridor Overlay District
A. Description of District. The Roosevelt Highway Corridor is a 15-mile portion of
Roosevelt Highway (US 29) from the Fulton County line in Palmetto to Camp Creek
Parkway in College Park. The corridor spans several governing jurisdictions, and
includes portions of the City of Palmetto, the City of Fairburn, the City of Union
City, the City of College Park, the Red Oak Community and unincorporated Fulton
County.
Through architectural form, landscape, hardscape, signage and graphics, this
Overlay District seeks to reflect the history of the highway corridor, to
accommodate modes of transportation other than the automobile such as
bicycling, walking and transit through pedestrian oriented street design and
circulation patterns and to improve the aesthetics of the corridor.
The purpose and intent of the Roosevelt Highway Corridor Overlay District is to
unify the Corridor with aesthetic design elements while protecting the
separateness and individualities of the communities of Palmetto, Union City, Red
Oak and College Park. Moreover, this district seeks to maintain Roosevelt
Highways function as a viable transportation facility that is not encumbered by
endless commercial sprawl. This is accomplished by segmenting the corridor
within each community into three Development Districts: Core, Primary and
Secondary Development Districts, which are defined below.
The Core Development District (CDD) allows for the development of a pedestrian
oriented commercial village center with a mix of uses for residents to live, work
and relax. The Core District includes residential uses combined with retail, service
commercial, office and institutional uses in the same buildings. The Core District
supports and promotes commercial vitality and is a pedestrian oriented
environment. Road frontage encourages vehicles to slow down and streetscape
features are designed for traffic calming and pedestrian safety. Preservation of the
existing historical character of the area is critical in the Core District.
The Primary Development District (PDD) occurs outside the Core District and
transitions the more highly developed Core to a more automobile friendly
concept. A mix of commercial, residential and community uses inhabit the less
densely developed Primary District but are not permitted to be mixed into the
same structure. Pedestrian use is not as high in this district, and road frontage is
geared to pedestrian safety. The Primary District promotes a unified architectural
style in terms of density, spacing and massing of buildings.
The Secondary Development District (SDD) is the parkway that links the Primary
Districts and serves to protect rural land and natural resources of the Roosevelt
Highway Corridor. The secondary District is even more automobile and truck
oriented and generally limited to industrial and corporate complexes with natural
182 | P a g e
barriers screening the development off each side of the road. While pedestrian use
is lower here, road frontage continues to address safety associated with transit and
school bus activities.
This Overlay is adopted for the purpose of advancing community development
goals, promoting economic development and promoting and protecting health,
safety, order, prosperity and general welfare of the citizens of Union City, Georgia.
B. General Requirements. The 15-mile Roosevelt Highway Corridor is a multi
jurisdictional corridor and includes portions of the City of Palmetto, the City of
Union City, The City of College Park, the Red Oak Community and unincorporated
Fulton County between the Fulton/Coweta County line and Camp Creek Parkway.
Core, Primary and Secondary Development Districts have been delineated with the
Roosevelt Highway Overlay District.
Specifically for the City of Union City, the Overlay District applies to all properties
zoned or developed for nonresidential and residential uses (except single family
detached dwelling units), and shall adhere to specific design guidelines for each
development district set forth and detailed in the Design Guidelines for the
Roosevelt Highway Corridor.
Parcels identified in the City of Union Citys Core Development District are
specifically delineated. In the Primary and Secondary Districts, only parcels
fronting Roosevelt Highway shall comply with the regulations.
Whenever provisions of this section conflict with any other article or section in the
Zoning Ordinance of the City of Union City or any other City ordinances,
regulations or resolutions, these standards shall prevail.
C. Permitted Uses. The Core Development District (CDD) shall utilize the Mixed-Use
District (MXD) regulations of the City of Union City Code. The MXD District is
intended to integrate work places, shopping, entertainment services, and housing
and community facilities in a pedestrian friendly, village-like environment. Where
provisions of the Mixed-Use District conflict with any articles of this resolution, the
provisions of this article and guidelines detailed in the Design Guidelines for the
Roosevelt Highway Corridor shall prevail.
The Primary Development District (PDD) and the Secondary Development District
(SDD) shall be comprised of land uses designated by The City of Union City and
zoned accordingly, but shall be in compliance with the regulations of this overlay
district and shall comply with guidelines detailed in the Design Guidelines for the
Roosevelt Highway Corridor.

ARTICLE VIII
TOWERS AND ANTENNAS
8-1 Applicability.
A. District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this ordinance shall
govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are installed at a
height in excess of, any existing height limitations of any other zoning
ordinances of the City. The height limitations applicable to buildings and
structures shall not apply to towers and antennas.
B. Public property. Antennas or towers located on publicly owned property shall
be exempt from the requirements of this Ordinance, provided a license or lease
authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the City Council.
C. Amateur Radio: Receive-Only Antenna. This Ordinance shall not govern any
tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under 70 feet in height and is
owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or
is used exclusively for receive-only antennas.
D. Grandfathered Towers and Antennas. Any tower or antenna existing on the
effective date of this Ordinance shall not be required to meet the requirements
of this Ordinance, other than the requirements of 8-2.E and 8-2.F. Any such
towers or antennas that fail to meet the requirements of this Ordinance shall
be referred to in this Ordinance as grandfathered towers or grandfathered
antennas.
8-2 General Guidelines and Requirements.
A. Purpose and Goals. The purpose of this Ordinance is to establish guidelines for
the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this Ordinance are to:
1. Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to
provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently;
2. Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites;
3. Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent
possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
4. Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that
minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas; and,
199 | P a g e
5. Discourage, specifically, the location of towers in residential areas and,
generally, the proliferation of towers throughout the community.
B. Principal or Accessory Use. Antennas and towers may be considered either
principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on
the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such
lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of tower or antenna
complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to
setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements and other such
requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the
antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots.
C. Inventory of Existing Sites. Each applicant for an administrative approval or a
special use permit shall provide the Planning and Zoning Department with an
inventory of its existing towers, including specific information about the
location, height and design of each tower. The Planning and Zoning
Department may share such information with other applicants applying for
administrative appeals or special use permits under this Ordinance or other
organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the City.
D. Aesthetics and Lighting. The guidelines set forth in 8-3.D shall govern the
location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this
Ordinance; provided, that the City may waive these requirements if, in its sole
discretion, it determines that the goals of this Ordinance are better served
thereby.
1. Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any
applicable standards of the FAA, be painted sky blue or gray, so as to
reduce visual obtrusiveness.
2. At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to
the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and
landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and
built environment.
3. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and
supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color
that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting
structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually
unobtrusive as possible.
4. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other
applicable authority. If lighting is required, the Council may review the
available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the
least disturbance to the surrounding views.
200 | P a g e
E. Federal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and
regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the federal
government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such
standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and
antennas governed by this Ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas
into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6)
months of the effective date of such standards and regulations. Failure to
bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at
the owners expense.
F. Building Codes; Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers,
the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with
standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable
standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries
Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the City
inspection department concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes
and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon
notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days
to bring such tower into compliance with such codes and standards. If the
owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the
governing authority may remove such tower at the owners expense.
8-3 Conditional Uses.
A. General. The uses listed in this section are deemed to be conditional uses and
shall require administrative review. Nevertheless, all such uses shall comply
with 8-2.D, 8-2.E and 8-2.F of this Ordinance and all other applicable
Ordinances, and prior to the installation of any antenna or tower pursuant to
this section, the owner of such antenna or tower shall send written notice to
the Planning and Zoning Department, which notice shall include the location,
size and configuration of such antenna or tower.
B. Specific Conditional Uses. The following uses are conditionally permitted
1. Locating a tower in an M-1 or M-2 Zoning District or within any property
located within 1,000 feet of either side of the right-of-way of a collector,
arterial or interstate road on property zoned TCMU (added 7/20/10,
Ordinance 10-13); provided, however, that such tower shall be set back
from any existing off-site residential structure a distance equal to the height
of the tower, plus 50 feet;
2. Installing an antenna in an M-1 or M-2 Zoning District or within any
property located within 1,000 feet of either side of the right-of-way of a
collector, arterial or interstate road on property zoned TCMU (added
7/20/10, Ordinance 10-13) on an existing structure that is 50 feet in height
or greater, so long as said additional antenna adds no more than 20 feet to
the height of said existing structure, such structures to include buildings,
201 | P a g e
signs, light poles, water towers and other free-standing non-residential
structures; and,
3. Installing an antenna on any existing tower of any height, so long as the
addition of said antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of said
existing tower and said existing tower is not a grandfathered tower.
202 | P a g e
8-4 Administrative Approvals.
A. General.
1. The Planning and Zoning Department may administratively approve the
uses listed in this section.
2. Applicants for administrative approval shall apply to the Planning and
Zoning Department, providing the information set forth in 8-5.B and 8-5.D
of this Ordinance.
3. The Planning and Zoning Department shall respond to each such
application within 30 days of receiving it by either approving the
application, denying the application, or requesting further information
from the applicant. If the Planning and Zoning Department fails to respond
to the applicant within said 30 days, then the application shall be deemed
to be approved.
4. In connection with any such administrative approval, the Planning and
Zoning Department may, in order to encourage shared use,
administratively waive any district setback requirement by up to 50%.
B. Specific Administratively Approved Uses. The following uses may be approved
by the Planning and Zoning Department after conducting an administrative
review:
1. Installing an antenna in an M-1 or M-2 or within any property located within
1,000 feet of either side of the right-of-way of a collector, arterial or
interstate road on property zoned TCMU (added 7/20/10, Ordinance 10-
13)Zoning District on an existing structure other than a tower (such as a
building, sign, light pole, water tower or other free standing non-residential
structure), so long as such addition does not add more than 20 feet to the
height of the existing structure.
2. Installing an antenna on an existing tower, including a grandfathered tower
and further including the placement of additional buildings or other
supporting equipment used in connection with said antenna, so long as the
addition of said antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of said
existing tower.
8-5 Conditional Use Permits.
A. General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of conditional use
permits:
1. A conditional use permit shall be required for the construction of a tower or
the placement of an antenna.
203 | P a g e
2. Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits,
whether civil, mechanical, electrical or radio-frequency, shall be certified by
a qualified professional engineer.
B. Site Plan. Applicants requesting a conditional use permit under this ordinance
shall submit a scaled site plan, showing the location and dimensions of all
improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency
coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing,
landscaping and other information necessary to access compliance with this
Ordinance.
C. Factors Considered in Granting Conditional Use Permits. The City shall
consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional
use permit, although the City may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant
of one or more of these criteria, if, in the sole discretion of the City, the goals of
this Ordinance are better served thereby:
1. Height of the proposed tower;
2. Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district
boundaries;
3. Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
4. Surrounding topography;
5. Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
6. Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that
have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; and,
7. Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in
Section 8-3 of this Ordinance.
D. Availability of Suitable Existing Towers or Other Structures. No new tower shall
be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction
of the City that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicants
proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower
or structure can accommodate the applicants proposed antenna may consist
of the following:
1. No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area
required to meet applicants engineering requirements;
2. Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicants
engineering requirements;
204 | P a g e
3. Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to
support applicants proposed antenna and related equipment;
4. Applicants proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference
with the antenna on the existing towers or structure;
5. The fees or costs required to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt
an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs
exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable;
6. Property owners of existing towers or structures are unwilling to
accommodate reasonably the applicants needs; and,
7. Applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render
existing towers and structures unsuitable.
E. Setbacks and Separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements
shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a conditional use permit is
required; provided, however, that the City may, in its sole discretion, reduce the
standard setbacks and separation requirements if the goals of this Ordinance
would be better served thereby.
1. Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower plus 50
feet from any off site residential structure;
2. Towers, guys and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum district yard
setback requirements; and,
3. Towers over 70 feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter of a
mile from any existing tower that is over 70 feet in height.
F. Security Fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six
(6) feet and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device;
provided, however, that the City may, in its sole discretion, waive such
requirements if the goals of this Ordinance would be better served thereby.
1. Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer that effectively screens the
view of the tower compound from adjacent residential property. The
standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four (4) feet wide
outside the perimeter of the compound;
2. In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the
landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether; and,
3. Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be
preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers
205 | P a g e
sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter
may be a sufficient buffer.
8-6 Removal of Abandoned Towers and Antennas. Any antenna or tower that is not
operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned,
and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of
receipt of notice from the City notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such
antenna or tower is not removed within said 90 days, the governing authority may
remove such antenna or tower at the owners expense. If there are two or more
users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users
cease using the tower.
206 | P a g e
ARTICLE IX
TREE PRESERVATION AND LANDSCAPE ENHANCEMENT
9-1 Purpose
The purpose of this ordinance is to create and maintain a structure of standards
that will preserve and conserve the rural and urban wooded environment of Union
City now and into the future. There is great value in trees and they are a resource
that belongs to the whole community. Because trees are a resource that is like any
other valuable resource, they will be maintained and protected. Union City will
plant tree species that are best suited for this environment (hardy, durable and
highly adaptable) and encourage private citizens to do the same. Union City will
require replanting of trees by construction companies, developers, and other
businesses that remove trees in our community.
Furthermore, trees generate public benefits including:
1. The purification of air;
2. The moderation of the micro-climate;
3. The reduction of noise and glare;
4. The conservation of energy in terms of heating and cooling;
5. The prevention of soil erosion;
6. Reduced costs in terms of stormwater management;
7. The minimization of flood potential;
8. Improve water quality;
9. The enhancement and stabilization of property values;
10. Improved aesthetics;
11. The preservation of rural character.
9-2 Applicability.
A. This ordinance shall apply to any activity that requires a Land Disturbance
Permit.
B. Exemptions from The City of Union City Tree Protection and Landscape
Enhancement Ordinance are:
1. Trees found to be dead, diseased, insect-infested, or severely damaged by
storms or wind as determined by the Zoning Administrator or his or her
designee, an Arborist, a Registered Forester or the Georgia Forestry
Commission.
2. Orchards and tree nurseries in active commercial operations;
207 | P a g e
3. All property involved in a viable agricultural operation (establishment,
cultivation, or harvesting of fields) or livestock operation;
4. Playgrounds, golf courses, athletic fields or courts approved by the City;
and,
5. The removal, replacement, planting, pruning, or transplanting of trees on
an existing single-family or duplex residential property that has formerly
received a Certificate of Occupancy and remains in residential use.
C. Non-conforming Uses. This Ordinance shall not apply to any portion of a
property included within the limits of a valid land disturbance permit issued
prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, subject to all time constraints
relating the permit issued and provided that all requirements of Chapter 5-34
that were in effect upon the date of issuance of the land disturbance permit
shall be met, except requirements duly varied as provided by Article XIII of the
Union City Zoning Ordinance.
9-3 Procedure.
A. Application Procedure. A Tree Protection Plan (TPP) must be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator or his designee upon application for a Land Disturbance
Permit. For purposes of the Tree Protection and Landscape Enhancement
Ordinance the Zoning Administrators designee is the City Engineer. The TPP
may be combined with required Construction Plans or Site Plans when
possible. The TPP must be prepared by a qualified Landscape Architect,
Registered Forester or Arborist except when the land disturbing activity is for a
detached single-family development or lot within such development. In the
case of a detached single-family development or lot within such development,
the TPP may also be prepared by the owner, developer or contractor applying
for a Land Disturbance Permit.
B. Application Requirements.
1. Tree Survey. A tree survey shall be submitted along with a Tree Protection
Plan in the construction plan and site plan approval process. The tree
survey shall be prepared in the field by an Arborist, Registered Landscape
Architect or Registered Forester and recorded on a site plan using a scale of
not greater than 1=50. It shall identify the location, size, and species
(common name) of all trees existing on the site. All trees 12 inches and
larger shall be shown on the Tree Survey. Trees larger than two (2) inches
shall be identified if they are to be counted toward required tree density for
the Tree Protection Plan. Trees other than specimen trees that are outside
the protected zone are not required to be counted, but shall be identified
as a stand, with information concerning the approximate number, size, and
species noted on the survey drawing.
208 | P a g e
2. Tree Protection Plan (TPP). Three (3) copies of a TPP shall be submitted with
other documents required for construction plan or site plan approval
before any land disturbance occurs. The TPP shall be prepared by an
Arborist, Registered Landscape Architect or Registered Forester. The TPP
shall be submitted on a current topographic survey of the site, and drawn
to the same scale as the Tree Survey, but not less than 1=50. The TPP shall
clearly show all of the information listed below:
a. The identity of the tract of land upon which trees sought to be removed
are located, including land lot, land district, adjacent streets and all
boundaries of the tract.
b. The name, address, and phone number of the owner of the land and of
the applicant, if not the owner.
c. The type, location, and size of specimen trees, significant trees, and
other trees being protected and preserved. Only trees designated on
the TPP shall count toward required density.
d. The location, size, species, and critical root zone of any specimen trees,
including those intended to be removed.
e. All protected areas, natural areas, landscape areas, zoning buffer areas,
stream buffer areas, and areas of tree replacement.
f. Locations, details and specifications for tree protection measures,
including tree fencing, erosion control, retaining walls, tunneling for
utilities, aeration systems, transplanting, staking and signage.

9-4 Standards of Tree Preservation and Replacement
A. Tree Preservation.
1. It shall be the policy of the City of Union City that preserving existing native
species of trees is preferred to replacing them with newly planted trees.
Tree removal may be disallowed where reasonable accommodations can
be made to alter the proposed project to save significant trees and such
210 | P a g e
accommodation has not been made in the grading plan, site plan, or
building plan.
2. Specimen trees shall be preserved wherever feasible except for trees that
are diseased, structurally unsound, or damaged to such a degree that they
are unlikely to survive and may pose a threat to human safety or cause
serious property damage.
3. Specimen trees that are in good health and condition shall not be removed
from any proposed right of way or from the protected area of any private
property without approval from the City Engineer. The City Engineer may
authorize removal of a healthy, sound specimen tree only if he or she finds
the location of the tree is clearly within the buildable area of the lot or
street right-of-way and the relocation of necessary permanent buildings or
site improvements to save the tree would not be feasible. Removal of any
other specimen tree from private property shall be prohibited.
4. Tree removal shall be disallowed if severe soil erosion or runoff problems
will result due to topography, soil type, or proximity to flood plain or stream
buffer, and the removal will substantially alter the existing soils and
increase runoff and erosion.
5. Trees shall not be removed from the floodplain, except as follows:
a. Trees found to be diseased or insect infested by the Zoning
Administrator, County Extension Service, the Georgia Forestry
Commission, an Arborist, or a Registered Forester; or
b. As necessary for construction, repair or maintenance of public roads,
utilities or drainage systems; or
c. As part of a Corp of Engineers approved wetland mitigation plan.
6. Existing trees to be preserved on a lot or site which is the subject of a
permit allowing land disturbance shall be protected from damage due to
physical root damage, indirect root damage, and trunk and crown damage.
Protective measures should be defined in the TPP for trees that are not to
be removed. Protection measures shall include but are not limited to:
a. Approved protective fencing installed to encircle critical root zones of
trees to be preserved. All protective measures shall remain in
functioning condition until completion of the project or until the
Certificate of Occupancy is issued.
b. No person engaged in the construction of any structure(s) or
improvement(s) or any activity shall encroach or place solvents,
material, construction machinery or temporary soil deposits within six
211 | P a g e
(6) feet of the area outside the critical root zone, as defined herein, of
any existing tree that is subject to preservation in accordance with this
section.
c. Increasing the grade by adding soil layers onto the trees root system or
trenching below a trees roots shall only be done with the approval of
the City Engineer.
B. Tree Density Requirements.
1. Property subject to Article IX shall be developed so as to provide a
minimum tree density of 100 inches per acre of the entire tract being
developed. The tree density shall be calculated as a collective
measurement of tree trunk diameter of existing and replacement trees.
Existing trees to be preserved shall be given density credit based on their
size measured in DBH. The size of replacement trees shall be measured
according to nursery standards using tree caliper.
2. Within the protected areas of the site at least 50 percent of all significant
trees shall be preserved.
3. Replacement trees required to be planted on the site may include street
trees.
4. Parking Lot Landscaping. Off-street parking lots, which contain more than
five (5) off-street parking spaces on any single lot, shall contain landscaping
and plantings along streets as provided in Article X. Such trees may be
counted toward tree density requirements.
5. Alternative compliance. Where the City Engineer determines that
minimum tree density cannot be met due to natural site constraints, the
number of trees to be planted on a site or lot shall be determined by the
City Engineer based on site review. Thereafter, the owner/ developer/
builder shall, with the concurrence of the City Engineer, provide the
remaining balance of required trees to be planted on City property,
including rights of way of existing streets. When this approach is exercised,
the City shall first determine the variety, size, and number of trees to be
furnished by the owner/ developer/ builder. The City then will obtain prices
from a minimum of two (2) Plant Nurseries and/ or Landscape contractors,
selected by the City to supply and plant the required plant materials. Prior
to issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy, an amount equal to the lower
of the bid prices will be paid by the owner/ developer/ builder to the City.
The City, at its option, may elect to proceed to have planting done on City
land or right of way or to hold these funds until more suitable planting
conditions prevail. Upon payment, the owner/ developer/ builder will be
relieved of any further responsibility for the fulfillment of these
requirement for the subject property.
212 | P a g e
6. If landscaping is not established, the Zoning Administrator or his/her
designee may approve issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy conditioned
on provision of cash, cashiers check or money (Cash Deposit) order to be
deposited in an escrow account in the amount of 110 percent of the City
Engineers estimate of the cost of completing all required work. The Cash
Deposit shall be held for a period of 18 months. In the event that the
landscaping work is not completed prior to the date on which said 18
months expires, the City shall be entitled to use said Cash Deposit to
complete the landscape work on behalf of the property owner. At the time
of the acceptance of the Cash Deposit, the permittee, builder or owner shall
sign a document informing him or her of the provisions necessary to
complete the landscape work. The document referred to herein shall be
signed by the permitee, builder or owner prior to the time a certificate of
occupancy is issued. (Ordinance 11-08, 6/21/11)

2. Specific powers and duties.
a. Issuance or denial of permits. It shall be the duty of the Zoning
Administrator, upon receipt of a completed application for a sign permit, to
examine the plans and specifications and other data. If the proposed
structure is in compliance with the requirements of this section and all
other applicable provisions of this ordinance, a written permit shall be
issued to the applicant by the Zoning Administrator. If said structure is not
in compliance with the requirements of this section and all other applicable
provisions of this ordinance, a written denial of permit shall be issued to the
applicant by the Zoning Administrator. In no case shall any process of
application review extend for a period of time exceeding thirty days from

upon which a denial is mailed. Should the process exceed thirty days, it
shall be deemed that the application is approved and a permit shall be
issued to the applicant by the Zoning Administrator. Issuance of a permit
shall in no way prevent the City from later declaring the sign to be illegal if
the structure fails to substantially comply with the specifications submitted
in the application or some new information of illegality is discovered.
(amended September 16, 2003, Ordinance 2003-11)

misrepresentations existed as to material facts in the application or plans
upon which the permit of approval was based.
c. Suspension of permits and certificates. The Zoning Administrator may
suspend a sign permit or certificate of compliance where an administrative
determination has been duly made that an error or omission on the part of
either the permit applicant or a government agency existed in the issuance
of the permit or certificate. A new permit or certificate shall be issued in
place of the incorrect permit or certificate after correction of the error or
omission.

City Clerk.
2. Filing procedure. Application for permits to erect, hang or place a sign shall be
submitted on forms obtainable from the Zoning Administrator. Each
application shall be accompanied by plans showing the area, size, character

such sign and the finished grade; and the horizontal distance between such
sign and the street right-of-way.
3. Inspection. A representative of the City shall inspect each sign or other
advertising structure regulated by this ordinance from time to time for the
purpose of ascertaining whether such structure is safe and lawful. If a sign is
deemed to be in need of repair, the owner shall have 14 days from the date of
written notice from the City, in which to repair or remove such sign. Missing
letters from a raised letter or changeable copy sign, missing panels, peeling
paint from a painted sign, etc. shall constitute a need for repair.
4. Lapse of sign permit. A continuing sign permit shall lapse automatically if the
occupational tax certificate for the premises lapses, is revoked or is not
renewed. A sign permit shall also lapse if the business activity on the premises

permit was issued which was in existence on or before December 20, 2005, or
which was constructed in accordance with the ordinances and other applicable
laws in effect on the date of its construction, but which by reason of its size,
height, location, design or construction is not in conformance with the
requirements of this ordinance, shall be considered a nonconforming sign.
Such a sign shall be allowed to remain in place and be maintained (provided
that no action is taken which increases the degree or extent of the
nonconformity) until there is a change of business name (single business), a
change of complex name (multi-business), or the sign and/or supporting
structure is totally destroyed as a result of natural causes, Acts of God,
228 | P a g e
vandalism or any other cause. In the case of a change of ownership where the
business name and existing signage (face and structure) remain the same, said
sign shall be allowed to remain in place.

and become void under the same circumstances as those under which any
other sign permit may lapse and become void.
11-9 Measurement; Construction and Maintenance Standards.
A. Measurement of Sign Area. The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a
wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the
smallest geographic measurement that will encompass the extreme limits of the
writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with any material or
color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed.
B. Measurement of Sign Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as to the
distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest
attached component of the sign. The decorative façade, including post and/or
columns, shall not exceed 25 feet in height. Normal grade shall be construed to be
the lower of: (1) existing grade prior to construction, or (2) the newly established
grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating
solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade
cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the
assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal
to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of
the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zone lot,
whichever is greater. Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a
public street, the sign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of
the street before the height limitations are applied (surveyors certificate required).
C. Sign Location.
1. Obstructions to doors, windows or fire escapes. No sign shall be erected,
relocated or maintained so as to prevent free ingress or egress from any door,
window or fire escape.
2. Signs not to constitute traffic hazard. No sign or part thereof, except
authorized traffic signs, shall be located in any state, county or city right-ofway.
No sign may be located any closer than 15 feet from an intersection as
measured from the intersection of the two (2) rights-of-way.
D. Construction Standards.
1. Face of sign shall be smooth. No sign shall be constructed so as to have nails,
tacks or wires protruding there from.
229 | P a g e
2. Illumination of signs. Signs, when illumination is permitted, may be
illuminated internally or externally.
E. Maintenance and Appearance.
1. All signs shall be maintained in good condition in order to present a neat
appearance. The City may remove after due notice, any sign which shows

13-5 Powers and Duties.
A. Appeals from Actions of Zoning Administrator. The Board shall hear and decide
upon appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement,
decision or determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement
of these regulations.
1. Who May Appeal. Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved
or by an officer, department, board or bureau of the governing authority
affected by any decision of the Zoning Administrator. Such appeals shall be
filed no later than 30 days after the date of notification of the decision
appealed from the filing with the Zoning Administrator and with the Board a
notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Administrator
shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record
upon which the action appealed from was taken.
2. Legal Proceedings Stayed. An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance
of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the
Board that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his
opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such a case, proceedings
shall not be stayed otherwise than by restraining order which may be granted
by the Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning
Administrator, and on due cause shown.
3. Extent of Board of Appeals Power. The Board may, in conformity with the
provisions of these regulations, reverse or affirm the requirement, decision or
determination of the Zoning Administrator. The Board may direct the issuance
of a permit. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to carry out the
decisions of the Board.
B. Request for a Variance. The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases
such variance from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing the special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be
observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done;
provided, however, that a variance shall not be granted for a use of land or
building or structure that is prohibited by this Ordinance in the District in question.
A variance may be granted in an individual case upon a finding by the Board that
the following exists:
1. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular
piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography;
2. The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would
create a practical difficulty of unnecessary hardship;
242 | P a g e
3. Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved;
4. Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or
impair the purposes and intent of these regulations; provided, however, no
variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is
prohibited by this Ordinance;
5. A literal interpretation of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of any
rights that others in the same District are allowed; and,
6. Provided that the Board may impose or require such additional restrictions and
standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and
residents in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the
general neighborhoods; and provided that wherever the Board shall find, in the
case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations, that
any of the terms, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was
granted are not being complied with, said Board shall rescind and revoke such
permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full
opportunity for a hearing. In exercising the above powers, the Board shall not
consider any non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures of buildings
in the same District, and no permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in
other Districts as grounds for the issuance of a variance.
D. Request for Extension or Enlargement of the Nonconforming Use of a Structure.
The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases an extension of an existing
non-conforming use which the Board is specifically authorized to pass on under
the terms of this Ordinance. Said extension may be granted in an individual case
upon a finding by the Board that:
1. The use is a non-conformance as defined in these regulations;
2. The use is in full compliance with all requirements of these regulations
applicable to non-conformances; and,
3. The extension of said use will not further injure a permitted use on adjacent
property in the same District.
E. Continuance of Nonconformance. The Board may allow a non-conformance to be
reestablished after discontinuance for 12 consecutive months where it is deemed
by the Board that;
1. The design, construction and character of the land, building or structure is not
suitable for uses permitted in the District in which the non-conformance is
situated;
2. Undue hardships to the property owner would result in not allowing the
continuance of a non-conformance;
243 | P a g e
3. Adjacent property would not be unduly damaged by such continuance; and,
4. The use is to be identical to the prior non-conformance.
F. Compliance with Standards. Where and application to the Board is initiated due to
an existing violation of the Ordinance and said application is denied, the violation
shall be required to be corrected within 10 days of such denial or as specified by
the Board if a greater time period is necessary. The maximum extension of the
time shall not exceed 30 days.
G. Forms. Forms shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator for the Board, and the
appellant shall pay the Zoning Administrator for expenses incidental to the appeal.
No form shall be accepted by the Zoning Administrator unless it contains all
pertinent information and is accompanied by the required fee to defray expenses.
