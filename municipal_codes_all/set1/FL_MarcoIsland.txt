PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Marco Island, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of this 2004 republication were the 2000 Code, as supplemented through April 7, 2003, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The 2000 publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Senior Code Attorney, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. This 2004 republication was completed under the supervision of Tassy W. Spinks, Editor. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Laura A. Litzan, City Clerk, and Mr. A. William Moss, City Manager, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

An Ordinance Adopting and Enacting a New Code for the City of Marco Island, Florida; Providing for the Repeal of Certain Ordinances Not Included Therein; Providing a Penalty for the Violation Thereof; Providing for the Manner of Amending Such Code; and Providing When Such Code and This Ordinance Shall Become Effective. 
Whereas, Article VIII of the State Constitution and Chapter 166 of the Florida Statutes provide that municipalities shall have the governmental, corporate, and proprietary powers to enable them to conduct municipal government, perform municipal functions, and render municipal services, and may exercise any power for municipal purposes, except when expressly prohibited by law; and 
Whereas, Section 1.01 of the Marco Island City Charter empowers the city to adopt, amend, or repeal ordinances, resolutions, and codes as may be required for the good governing of the city. 
Now, Therefore, be it Ordained by the City Council for the City of Marco Island, Florida: 
    Section 1. The Code entitled "Code of Ordinances, City of Marco Island, Florida," published by Municipal Code Corporation, consisting of chapters 1 through 54, each inclusive, is adopted. 
    Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before February 7, 2000, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
    Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
    Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500.00 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 60 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court. 
    Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code Section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the City may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
    Section 5. Additions or amendments to the code when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the City Council to make the same a part of the code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the code includes the additions and amendments. 
    Section 6. Ordinances adopted after February 7, 2000, that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code. 
    Section 7. This ordinance shall become effective immediately upon adoption by the Marco Island City Council. 
    Passed in open and regular session through roll call vote by the City Council of the City of Marco Island, Florida, this 6th day of November, 2000.

The format and content of the petition to be circulated shall conform to the requirements of general law for amending municipal charters and the general election laws and administrative rules for initiative petitions.

Section 6.05. - Action on Petitions. 
(1)  Action by Council. Once the certification of valid City electors is received, Council shall take appropriate action addressing the sufficiency of the petition pursuant to Section 166.031, Florida Statutes. If the petition is sufficient, Council shall schedule the item for an election or, if appropriate under Section 6.02 of this Charter, Council may repeal or amend an existing ordinance thereby negating the need for an election. The Council, in its discretion, may schedule the matter at either the next city election or a special election. If the petition is to repeal an ordinance, Council shall determine whether or not to repeal or amend the existing ordinance at the next regularly scheduled council meeting following the determination of petition sufficiency. If Council, in its discretion, determines not to amend or repeal the ordinance petitioned for repeal, a special election shall be called not less than ninety (90) days from the date of determination of petition sufficiency. The special election on the repeal of an ordinance shall be by mail ballot unless such election can be scheduled concurrently with a City, county, state, or federal election occurring within that time period. 
(2)  Submission to Voters. If Council decides a special election is to be held, it shall be conducted by mail ballot not less than ninety (90) days from the date of Council's determination of the need for a special election if there is no intervening city, county, state or federal election on which this matter could be placed. Passage of the times provided in subsection (1) without action by the Council shall be considered rejection, refusal, or declination. Copies of the proposed ordinance shall be made available to the votes - either at the polls or by mail ballot, whichever is appropriate. Any petition rejected by the voters may not be submitted again for one year. If repeal of a law is rejected by the voters, the law shall not again be suspended until repeal is supported by the voters or the Council repeals it. 
(3)  Withdrawal of Petitions. An initiative or referendum petition may be withdrawn at any time prior to the fortieth day preceding the day scheduled for a vote of the City by filing with the City Manager or other official designated by the Council a request for withdrawal signed by at least four members of the petitioner's committee. Upon the filing of such request, the petition shall have no further force or effect and all proceedings thereon shall be terminated. Any and all costs, including labor, associated with the preparation and acquisition of supplies for the conduct of an election scheduled, but subsequently canceled because of the withdrawal of the petition, shall be reimbursed by the City to the Supervisor of Elections in full.

(1)  Initiative. If a majority of the qualified electors voting on a proposed initiative ordinance vote in its favor, it shall be considered adopted upon certification of the election results and shall be treated in all respects in the same manner as ordinances of the same kind adopted by the Council. If conflicting ordinances are approved at the same election, the one receiving the greatest number of affirmative votes shall prevail to the extent of such conflict. 
(2)  Referendum. If a majority of the qualified electors voting on a referred ordinance vote against it, it shall be considered repealed upon certification of the election results.

(Ord. No. 11-3, § 3, 2-22-2011) 
Sec. 2-255. - General practices. 
(a)  [Method of procurement.] The method of procurement is dependent upon the type of commodity or service and the value of that commodity or service. Where required by state statute, city ordinance or department procedures, the city shall competitively award contracts in accordance with those statutes, ordinances or policy and procedures. 
(b)  Competition. Purchases should be planned and made on the basis of adequate competition whenever feasible. Adequate competition means the solicitation of sources to ensure that the price paid is fair and reasonable. The requirement for adequate competition does not preclude noncompetitive procurement as enumerated in this section. 
(1)  Request for bids (RFB) shall be used for projects exceeding $25,000.00 when the specifications for the product or services can be clearly defined and there is little or no leeway in the interpretation of the requirement. Care must be taken not to create a specification that only one vendor can meet. 
(2)  Request for proposals (RFP) shall be used for those projects that cannot be precisely defined and specifications are such that more than one approach or product type could fulfill the requirement. 
(3)  Request for qualifications (RFQ) shall be primarily used to obtain professional services. The intent is to choose the vendor based on qualifications rather than price alone. 
(c)  Noncompetitive purchases are permitted provided: 
(1)  Acquisition of supplies or services does not exceed $25,000.00 in value. 
(2)  In emergencies involving public health, public safety, or where necessary for repairs to city property in order to protect against further loss or damage to city property or to prevent or minimize serious disruption in city services. 
(3)  Where goods and services are available from federal, state or local government agencies, and contracts with firms that provide goods or services subject to uniform tariff, government regulation or area-wide rates (utilities). 
(4)  Repair, maintenance, remodeling, renovation, construction or demolition of a single project not involving an increase in the size and type of an existing facility. 
(5)  Maintenance and servicing of equipment by the manufacturer or authorized service agent of the equipment. 
(6)  Telecommunications systems and information technology, including data processing equipment, systems software, and reproduction equipment. 
(7)  Where complete systems or equipment, parts or replacements of specified makes and models are needed for interoperability, compatibility or standardization purposes. 
(8)  When competitive purchasing would not otherwise be in the best interest of the city. 
(9)  When purchasing land, buildings, structures, or assets of other government agencies or private utilities. 
(10)  When granting nonexclusive franchise agreements, or contracts to manage and operate municipal facilities and programs. 
(d)  Standards of conduct. City employees are held to the highest standard of conduct in the performance of their duties and shall conduct themselves so as to avoid even the appearance of any impropriety in the planning and execution of purchase requirements. All employees shall adhere to the standards of ethical conduct as listed in the city's personnel manual and other applicable policies and laws. 
(e)  Gifts and rebates. The city manager and every officer and employee of the city are expressly prohibited from accepting any valuable gift, whether in the form of service, loan, thing or promise that may tend to unduly and improperly influence them in the discharge of their duties. 
(f)  Public notice. Public notice should be provided for all purchases requirements valued at over $25,000.00 unless otherwise provided in this article. 
(g)  Purchasing methods. 
(1)  Small purchases are determined by the level of effort expected and the documentation of the effort used to ensure that the price received is fair and reasonable and is in direct proportion to the cost of the good or service. Purchasing requirements aggregating may not be separated solely for the purpose of avoiding formal contract procedures. When smaller purchases are a part (segment) of a system, process, structure, facility and/or project, the total cost of the system, etc., will determine the controlling purchasing method and procedure. 
(2)  The basis for award would be the lowest bid price submitted by a responsive and responsible bidder. 
(3)  Factors other than price are considered and negotiations with the best proposer(s) are used to determine the ultimate awardee. 
(4)  The method of the procurement of professional services is governed by F.S. § 287.055, the Consultants' Competitive Negotiation Act. 
(5)  Contracts or purchasing agreements that were obtained through competitive purchasing methods by federal, state, county, or municipal purchasing organizations can be used by the city in place of issuing its own RFBs or RFPs. 
(6)  Emergency procurement may justify noncompetitive purchasing. Documentation shall be prepared to enable the finance department to process the invoices and to provide management insight and ultimate approval. 
(7)  Design-build. Some of the primary objectives of using this procurement method are; (a) fast tracking of project completion (b) quick re-pricing and the ability to obtain an immediate analysis of options during a critical time when changes in plans are being considered, (c) competitive bids are obtained from each subcontractor and (d) it ensures that a project is going to be within an established budget before any early and/or substantial expenditures are made. For design-build projects, the city shall follow the procedures set forth in F.S. § 287.055, as may be amended from time to time. 
(8)  Purchases shall be made following established procurement and contracting principles and requirements of this article and supplemental procurement policies established by the city manager. The purchasing method employed is based upon the purchase requisition dollar estimate and the complexity of the purchase requirement. 
a.  Purchasing using petty cash. Department heads are authorized to make purchases for supplies and material valued up to $100.00 using departmental petty cash funds. The department head shall be responsible for the accounting and documentation of petty cash transactions. Use of petty cash for services is prohibited. 
b.  Purchasing using a credit card. The city has obtained credit cards and assigned them to select employees. The purpose of the credit card is to obtain services and supplies via internet and telephonic sources. A secondary use of the credit card is to pay for travel related expenses. In all instances, purchase via credit card should be limited to the signature authority of the individual making the purchase (e.g. $10.00, $500.00, $1,000.00). 
c.  [Employee purchase with subsequent reimbursement.] Purchasing by an employee with subsequent reimbursement by city is discouraged and should be used only as a last resort. 
d.  Competition for simplified or small purchases. Competition is not required if the city manager or designee determines that the price received is fair and reasonable. Where practicable, noncompetitive purchases may be distributed equitably among qualified suppliers in order to develop and maintain a responsive industrial/supplier base for the city. 
e.  Basis for award. Simplified purchases are awarded to the proposer who offers the best value to the city. Best value is obtained by basing the award on price or a combination of price with price-related factors, other evaluation factors, or both. Rationale for making other than low-price award will be documented in the appropriate files. In instances of equal prices and all other evaluation factors being equal, the award should be made to the local proposer. 
f.  Solicitations. Solicitation of proposals or quotations for small purchases may be done in writing or orally, at the discretion of the city manager or designee. Public notice of small purchases is not required, but may be initiated at the discretion of the city manager. 
g.  Negotiation. The city manager or designee may negotiate with proposers to ensure prices are reasonable, and that the city's requirements are understood. 
h.  Suppliers or sources in default to city. No purchases shall be made from vendors or contractors who are delinquent in the payment of taxes, licenses or other monies due the city. 
i.  Ordering methods. Simplified or small purchases may be made using petty cash or by purchase methods, such as purchase orders, unpriced purchase orders, blanket purchase orders and delivery agreements. 
j.  Administration of small purchases. Small purchases will be administered in accordance with the terms and conditions of the order or agreement. The city manager may amend, modify, cancel, or terminate purchase orders and agreements as deemed necessary by the particular circumstances or situation. 
(9)  Formal contract procedures. All supplies, material, equipment and contractual services valued in excess of $25,000.00, whether purchased competitively or noncompetitively through sealed bids or sealed proposals, shall be purchased by formal written contract or purchase order. Sale of property between two governmental entities shall be pursuant to Florida Statutes. The principles listed in the subparagraph below apply to formal contracts: 
a.  Public notice requirements. All purchase requirements over $25,000.00, except those authorized to be purchased noncompetitively by this article, shall only be awarded after due public notice. The public notice required for purchases over $25,000.00 shall include a general description of the articles or services, state where written solicitations may be obtained, and shall state the time and place for receipt of bids or proposals. 
b.  Solicitations. Except in cases of emergency, written solicitations will be issued when requesting sealed bids and sealed proposals. 
(Ord. No. 11-03, § 3, 2-22-2011) 
Sec. 2-256. - Use of sealed competitive bidding. 
    Sealed, competitive bidding is a method of contracting that employs competitive bids, public opening of bids, and award to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Invitations to bid (written solicitations) shall be used to request sealed bids and shall describe the purchase requirements. Sealed bid procedures are normally used for standard products or services where the specifications or statement of work are so definitive that prospective bidders may clearly understand the requirement and may take the necessary business risk to propose a firm-fixed price for the contract. 
(1)  Bid bonds for sealed bids. When deemed necessary, bid bonds shall be prescribed in the public notices inviting sealed bids. Upon entering into a contract, bidders will be entitled to return of the bid bond. A successful bidder shall forfeit any bid deposit upon failure on his part to enter into a contract within the working days specified following the award of contract. The city, in its sole discretion, may waive this forfeiture. 
(2)  Sealed bids-Award to other than low bidder. When contract award is not made to the lowest responsible bidder, a full and complete statement of the reasons should be prepared and filed with the purchase transaction. 
(3)  [Payment and performance bonding.] Bond of contractor, as defined in F.S. § 255.05, means (in part) any person entering into a formal contract with the state or any county, city, or political subdivision thereof, or other public authority or private entity, for the construction of a public building, for the prosecution and completion of a public work, or for repairs upon a public building or public work shall be required, before commencing the work or before recommencing the work after a default or abandonment, to execute, deliver to the public owner, and record in the public records of the county where the improvement is located, a payment and performance bond with a surety insurer authorized to do business in this state as surety. When such work is done for the state and the contract is for $100,000.00 or less, no payment and performance bond shall be required. At the discretion of the official or board awarding such contract when such work is done for any county, city, political subdivision, or public authority, any person entering into such a contract which is for $200,000.00 or less may be exempted from executing the payment and performance bond. 
(Ord. No. 11-3, § 3, 2-22-2011) 
Sec. 2-257. - Contract through negotiation. 
(a)  Negotiation is a process of contracting through the use of either competitive or other-than-competitive proposals and discussions. Negotiation is a procedure that may include the receipt of sealed proposals from offerors, permits bargaining, and may afford offerors an opportunity to revise their offers before award of a contract. Award may be made on a basis other than the lowest price. Negotiation is the preferred method of contracting when specifications or statements of work may not be definitive and may allow for variation in providing the products or services. Requests for proposals (written solicitation) should be used in negotiated acquisitions to communicate purchase requirements to prospective contractors and to solicit proposals or quotations from them. 
(1)  Award without negotiation. A contractor may be selected from the sealed proposals and award made without discussing proposals with the offerors. Whenever price or price-related factors are the most important or the only evaluation factors, award will normally be made without discussion, if adequate competition exists, to ensure that offerors submit their most favorable proposals at the outset. However, even when award will be based on price alone, discussions may be held as necessary to determine that the price is fair and reasonable. The decision to make an award without discussions shall be made by the city manager for amounts up to $50,000.00. 
(2)  Award with negotiation. Whenever appropriate, written or oral discussions may be held with offerors to resolve uncertainties in their proposals, to give them an opportunity to correct deficiencies, and to provide the opportunity to revise proposals. Discussion may be held with one offeror or with all offerors in the competitive range. The competitive range will be determined following evaluation of proposals. The competitive range shall be determined on the basis of the evaluation factors stated in the solicitation and shall only include all proposals that have a reasonable chance of being selected for award. 
(3)  Conduct of discussions. When necessary, discussions shall be held with the assistance or participation of technical, accounting or legal personnel as appropriate. Discussions may be conducted so as to: 
a.  Advise the offeror of deficiencies in its proposal in terms of user department requirements, but not deficiencies relative to other proposals. 
b.  Attempt to resolve uncertainties concerning aspects of the proposal. 
c.  Resolve any suspected mistakes by calling them to the offeror's attention as specifically as possible without disclosing information concerning other offerors' proposals or the evaluation process. 
d.  Provide the offeror a reasonable opportunity to submit any price, technical or other revisions to its proposal that may result from the discussions. 
(4)  Best and final offers. Upon completion of discussions, a request for "best and final offer" will be issued to all offerors still in the competitive range. 
(5)  Contractor selection. Following receipt of the best and final offers, the contract may be awarded to the offeror (contractor) whose proposal offers the best value to the city. 
(Ord. No. 11-3, § 3, 2-22-2011) 
Sec. 2-258. - Award of contracts. 
    Authority to award contracts: 
(1)  Contracts with a total value under $50,000.00 may be awarded by the city manager. 
(2)  Contracts with a total value over $50,000.00 shall be awarded by the city council. 
(3)  Exemptions: 
 Contracts for capital projects and equipment; 
 Utility department water and wastewater production chemicals.

1.  All purchasing requirements are met and documented and available for public inspection; and 
2.  The final cost per item does not exceed the approved current year budget cost by more than 25 percent of the budgeted amount or more than a total dollar value of $50,000.00. If the final cost of the item exceeds the approved current year budget cost by more than $50,000.00, the award shall be made by city council.

Sec. 2-259. - Change orders and renewals. 
(a)  [Change orders.] Change orders are often needed to (i) address unforeseen conditions, (ii) to add or decrease the scope of work due to changes in the city's requirements, and (iii) to execute price revisions to material supply contracts as are authorized by that contract. 
    The authority to award or approve change orders is subject to the following: 
(1)  For contracts authorized by city council, the city manager may approve change orders or contract modifications provided that the cumulative changes do not exceed 25 percent of the original contract amount and do not exceed the city manager's signature authorization level. 
(2)  For contracts of less than $50,000.00, the city manager may approve change orders or contract modifications provided that the cumulative contract and change orders do not exceed 25 percent of the original contract amount. 
(3)  The city manager may approve change orders decreasing the cost of the contract to the city that do not materially alter the character of the work contemplated by the contract. 
(4)  All change orders that the city manager is not authorized to approve must be formally approved by the city council before work may be authorized to begin. 
(5)  In the event that a change order which under the aforementioned criteria must be approved by city council, is of an emergency nature or if a delay in the approval by city council caused by the timing of a city council meeting will result in a work stoppage or cause increases in the cost of the project, the city manager is authorized to approve the change order and is then required to advise city council shortly thereafter of that change order and the circumstances which necessitated that decision. 
(b)  Contract renewals. 
(1)  If the city council previously awarded a contract that contained a renewal option, the city manager, or his designee, shall determine if such a renewal is in the best interest of the city and may exercise this option on behalf of the city in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, for a period not exceeding three years. 
(2)  When a contract is entered into by the city pursuant to city council approval and provides for one or more automatic renewals unless one party notifies the other of its intent not to renew, only the city council is authorized to decide not to renew the contract. 
(c)  Extensions. If provided for in a contract, the purchasing/contracts manager may authorize up to a 90-day extension of a contract in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. Otherwise, the city manager is authorized to extend, for operational purposes only for a maximum of 180 days, any contract entered into by the city pursuant to city council approval. Any further extensions of such contract require the approval of the city council. 
(d)  Price adjustment. For any material supply contract that has a price adjustment clause that allows for increases after the initial set price term, the purchasing/contracts manager has the authority to authorize price changes that are supported by either the consumer price index (CPI) or by documented fuel surcharges. That authority is limited to a maximum increase of 25 percent over the prior year price. Price changes exceeding that maximum are to be submitted to the city manager for approval. The city manager may either approve the change or may instruct the purchasing/contracts manager to advertise and award the contract.

Sec. 2-260. - Rejecting bids; negotiation.

(10)  The bidder does not appear to have the expertise, financial capability or other ability to meet the requirements of the contract to be awarded, or is otherwise shown not to be responsible. 
(b)  Negotiation. If no bid is received, the city council may authorize the purchasing/contracts manager to purchase by negotiation.

The debarment shall be for a period of not fewer than three years. The city manager shall also have the authority to suspend a contractor from consideration for award of city contracts, if there is probable cause for debarment, pending the debarment determination. The authority to debar and suspend contractors shall be exercised in accordance with the following regulations:

2.  Unauthorized withdrawal of a submitted bid or proposal after opening. 
3.  Failure to execute contract following notification of award. 
4.  A record of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance in accordance with the terms of one or more contracts or other contract violation. Failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance caused by acts beyond the control of the contractor shall not be considered to be a basis for debarment or suspension. 
(2)  Certification. Prior to or contemporaneously with any submission of a bid or request for proposal, or if there is no such bid or proposal, prior to execution of a contract for commodities or services, such bidder or proposer shall execute an affidavit certifying that neither the contractual party nor any of its principal owners or personnel have been convicted of any violations, debarment, or suspensions as set forth above. 
(3)  Debarment and suspension decisions. Subject to the provisions of this section, the city manager shall render a written decision stating the reasons for the debarment or suspension. A copy of the decision shall be provided promptly to the suspended or debarred party, along with a notice of said party's right to seek judicial relief. The city manager or designee is responsible for ensuring efficient and effective contracting, compliance with the terms and conditions of contracts, and protecting the interests of the city in all contractual relationships. The city manager is provided the latitude to exercise sound business judgment while adhering to the requirements of this section and sound procurement principles.

Sec. 2-262. - Dispute resolution and protest procedure. 
(a)  Any unresolved dispute pertaining to: 
(1)  Unadvertised or noncompetitive purchases made under this section shall be submitted to the city manager for resolution and/or final determination. 
(2)  Unresolved disputes pertaining to protests by bidders on advertised solicitations for purchases greater than $25,000.00 shall follow the following bid/proposal protest procedure. 
(b)  Bid/proposal protest procedure. Any firm that has submitted a formal bid/proposal to the City of Marco Island and who is adversely affected by an intended decision with respect to the award of the formal bid/proposal, shall file a written "notice of protest" with the purchasing/contracts manager within three days of either the bidder's receipt of the notice of disqualification of its bid, or receipt of a notice of intent to recommend award from the purchasing/contracts manager. Failure to submit the notice of protest as outlined in the Code shall constitute a waiver of proceedings. 
(1)  The "notice of protest" shall identify the solicitation and specify the basis for the protest. The "notice of protest" must be received by the city clerk and time stamped no later than 4:00 p.m. on the third working day following the posting date of the recommended award. 
(2)  The protesting party must then file a formal written protest within five calendar days after the receipt of the notice of protest. The protesting party shall post a bond (bond, cashier's check, or letter of credit) in an amount equal to five percent of the firm's total bid/proposal or $10,000.00, whichever is less. Said bond shall be designated and held for the payment of any costs that may be levied against the protesting firm by the city council, if the protest is deemed by the council to be a frivolous protest. 
(3)  The formal written protest shall contain the following: 
a.  Bid/proposal (RFB, RFP, or RFQ) identification number and title. 
b.  Name and address of the affected party and the title or position of the person submitting the protest. 
c.  A statement of all claimed disputed issues of material fact. If there are no disputed material facts, the formal written protest must so indicate. 
d.  A concise statement of the facts alleged and the rules, regulations, statutes or constitutional provisions which entitle the affected party to relief. 
e.  All information, documents, other materials, calculations and any statutory or case law authority in support of the ground for the protest. 
f.  A statement indicating the relief sought by the affected (protesting) party. 
g.  Any other relevant information that the affected party deems to be material to the protest. 
(4)  Upon receipt of a timely filed notice of protest, the purchasing/contracts manager will abate the award of the formal bid/proposal as appropriate until the protest is heard pursuant to the informal hearing process as further outlined below, except and unless the city manager shall find and set forth in writing particular facts and circumstances that would require an immediate award of the formal bid/proposal for the purpose of avoiding a danger to the public health, safety or welfare. Upon such written finding by the city manager, the city manager may authorize an expedited protest hearing and may void the requirement for a formal written protest and bond. 
(5)  A dispute committee, comprised of the city manager or designee, finance director or designee, public works director or designee and, as deemed appropriate, the city attorney to provide legal counsel, but not as a voting member, will convene a meeting within seven working days from receipt of the formal written protest with the protesting firm to attempt to resolve the protest. The hearing is to (1) review the basis of the protest; (2) to evaluate the facts and merits of the protest; and (3) to make a determination whether to accept or reject the protest. If at all possible, the parties will resolve the protest at this first meeting. 
(6)  If a resolution to the satisfaction of the dispute committee and the protesting firm cannot be accomplished during the meeting, the dispute committee, with respect to the merits of the protest, shall place the protest on the city council agenda with the staff recommendation and relevant background information. 
(7)  City council shall conduct a hearing on the matter at the regularly scheduled city council meeting. Following presentations by the affected parties, the council shall render its decision on the merits of the protest. 
(8)  If the council's decision upholds the recommendation by the dispute committee in denial of the protest regarding the award and further finds that the protest was either frivolous and/or lacked merit, the council, at its discretion, may assess costs, charges or damages associated with any delay of the award and any costs incurred with regard to the protest. The bond posted by the party filing the protest may be applied by city council at its discretion to pay in whole or in part said costs, charges, or damages. 
(9)  If the council's decision upholds the position of the party filing the protest, the purchasing/contracts manager will cancel any prior award and award the contract to the party filing the protest in the amount of that party's original bid/proposal.

(Ord. No. 11-3, § 3, 2-22-2011) 
Sec. 2-264. - Administration of contracts. 
    While administration of contracts (including purchase orders) requires the efforts and skills of many city employees, the city manager shall provide guidance regarding contract administration functions. Once a contract has been awarded pursuant to approval of contract requirements in this chapter, the city manager is authorized to issue purchase orders for the direct purchase of materials as part of a contract award. Competitive proposals shall not be required when a purchase is made for materials, equipment, prefabricated elements and components, appliances, fixtures and supplies bought under a sales tax savings procedure constituting part of a construction project, which construction contract has been awarded in compliance with this chapter. Concurrent with the issuance of a direct materials purchase order, a deduct purchase order amendment shall be issued to the contract holder.

The COR also reports on the progress of the contractor(s), the COR approves invoices (or release of progress payments), and COR prepares all change orders including termination paperwork at the end of a contract. The COR may not change the scope of work. 
(Ord. No. 11-3, § 3, 2-22-2011)

(b)  The purchasing agent's authority is exhibited in the form of a warrant which specifies the purchasing agent's scope of authority and the time frame of the warrant. All warrants will be issued by the city manager and reviewed no less than annually. 
(c)  The purchasing agent is responsible to adhere to all purchasing rules and regulations, and to maintain records of all buying transactions.

(1)  Prior to the issuance of obligations to finance the capital cost of such local improvement, the assessment coordinator shall provide first class mailed notice to the owner of each parcel of property subject to the assessment of the council's intent to issue such obligations. On or prior to the date specified in such notice (which shall not be earlier than the 30th day following the date on which the notice is delivered to the possession of the U.S. Postal Service), or such later date as the council may allow in its sole discretion, the owner of each parcel of property subject to the assessment shall be entitled to prepay the total assessment obligation upon payment of such parcel's share of the capital cost. 
(2)  Following the date specified in the notice provided pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, or such later date as the council may allow in its sole discretion, the owner of each parcel of property subject to the assessment shall be entitled to prepay the total remaining assessment obligation upon payment of an amount equal to the sum of (i) such parcel's share of the principal amount of obligations then outstanding, (ii) the premium associated with redemption of such parcel's share of the principal amount of obligations then outstanding, and (iii) interest on such parcel's share of the principal amount of obligations then outstanding, from the most recent date to which interest has been paid to the next date following such prepayment on which the city can redeem obligations after providing all notices required by the ordinance or resolution authorizing issuance of such obligations; provided, however, that during any period commencing on the date the annual assessment roll is certified for collection pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and ending on the next date on which unpaid ad valorem taxes become delinquent, the city may reduce the amount required to prepay the assessments imposed against any parcel of property by the amount of the assessment certified for collection with respect to such parcel. 
(3)  At the city's election, the assessment imposed against any parcel of property may be subject to acceleration and mandatory prepayment if at any time a tax certificate has been issued and remains outstanding in respect of such property. In such event, the amount required for mandatory prepayment shall be the same as that required for an optional prepayment authorized by subsection (2) of this section. 
(4)  The amount of all prepayments computed in accordance with this section shall be final. The city shall not be required to refund any portion of a prepayment if: 
a.  The capital cost of the local improvement is less than the amount upon which such prepayment was computed; or 
b.  Annual assessments will not be imposed for the full number of years anticipated at the time of such prepayment.

    If any assessment made under the provisions of this division is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the council is satisfied that any such assessment is so irregular or defective that the assessment cannot be enforced or collected, or if the council has omitted to include any property on the assessment roll which property should have been so included, the council may take all necessary steps to impose a new assessment against any property benefited by the local improvement, following, as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of this division, and in case such second assessment is annulled, the council may obtain and impose other assessments until a valid assessment is imposed. 
(Ord. No. 99-1, § 3.11, 2-1-1999)

(b)  The number of assessment units attributed to a parcel of property may be corrected at any time by the assessment coordinator. Any such correction which reduces an assessment shall be considered valid from the date on which the assessment was imposed and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the assessment imposed under the provisions of this division. Any such correction which increases an assessment or imposes an assessment on omitted property shall first require notice to the affected owner at the address shown on the tax roll notifying the owner of the date, time and place that the council will consider confirming the correction and offering the owner an opportunity to be heard. 
(c)  After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to errors and insolvencies for ad valorem taxes.

Footnotes: 
--- (11) --- 
Editor's note- Prior to the reenactment of art. VI by Ord. No. 02-19, Ord. No. 00-07, adopted June 19, 2000, repealed §§ 2-401-2-403, pertaining to lobbyist registration, in its entirety. 

Sec. 2-401. - Introduction. 
(a)  Goal. The goal of the city investment policy shall be to ensure the safety of all funds entrusted to the city (safety), the availability of those funds for the payment of all necessary obligations of the city (liquidity), and to provide for the investment of all funds, not immediately required, in interest-bearing securities (return). The highest investment priority will be safety of principal, followed by liquidity and return, in that order. 
    The city shall maintain a comprehensive cash management program in order to maximize total return as a viable and material revenue source to all operating and capital funds. The cash management program will include collection of accounts receivable on a timely basis, vendor payment in accordance with invoice terms and state law, and prudent investment of its available cash. 
(b)  Scope. This investment policy of the city shall include those funds in excess of those required to meet short-term expenses and any new funds created. This investment policy shall also include those funds which may be created by bond ordinances to include, but not limited to, the revenue fund, the sinking fund, reserve accounts and the bond amortization fund. These accounts will be called "bond trust accounts" for the remainder of this document. It will not pertain to pension or trust funds where there are other existing policies or indentures in effect. 
(c)  Amendments. This policy may be amended from time to time as the city council may so desire, or as state law may require. 
(Ord. No. 02-19, § 1, 6-3-2002) 
Sec. 2-402. - Responsibility. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish an investment officer for the city and define the authority of the investment officer. 
(b)  Responsibility and designation. The director of finance is the city's investment officer and is responsible for the city's comprehensive cash management program, including the administration of these investment policies. The investment officer shall maintain timely, accurate and systematic records of all securities, maturities and earnings. The investment officer must annually complete eight hours of continuing education in subjects and courses of study related to investment practices and products. 
    The investment officer shall be responsible for establishing written procedures for cash management and for the development and updating on the periodic basis of a cash forecast for the city. This cash forecast will provide information essential to properly structure investment maturities to meet required disbursement of funds. The investment officer is also responsible for developing and maintaining expertise in the areas of market evaluation and economic forecasting. Professional training and outside experts will be used as appropriate to meet the overall policy goal of maximizing interest earnings within the constraints of portfolio safety and liquidity. 
    Responsibility and authority for investment transactions resides with the investment officer. The investment officer is fully authorized to buy and sell investments in accordance with the goals and objectives of the city's investment strategy. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions. Employees and investment officers shall disclose any material interests in financial institutions with which they conduct business. They shall further disclose any personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the investment portfolio. Employees and officers shall refrain from undertaking personal investment transactions with the same individual with whom business is conducted on behalf of their entity. 
    Certain signatory responsibilities are shared by bonded officials for the purpose of providing continuity of the city's investment program in the absence of the investment officer. Positions authorized, including the investment officer, are: 
(1)  City manager. 
(2)  Finance director. 
(3)  Deputy city clerk. 
(c)  Bonding requirements. Each of the above authorized positions designated to serve as the investment officer or designee in the absence of the city's investment officer shall be bonded employees. All participants in the investment process shall act responsibly as custodians of the public trust and the investments should be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived from the investment.

Attached to Ordinance No. 02-19 as Appendix A. 
(Ord. No. 02-19, § 1, 6-3-2002) 
Sec. 2-404. - Investment objectives. 
    All investments are required to satisfy the investment objectives of safety of capital, liquidity of funds, and investment income, in that order of importance. The objective will be to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk. The investments purchased under the provisions of this investment policy shall be managed to maintain liquidity for meeting the city's needs for cash and to limit potential market risks in periods of rising interest rates which depress the market value of securities. Investments will be made in accordance with known/anticipated cash needs and cash-flow requirements enabling The city to meet day to day liquidity demands in addition to debt service payments and sinking fund deposits on the bond trust accounts. 
    As a general guideline, the city cash management portfolio shall be designed with the objective of meeting, over the course of full market cycles, the average return of three-month U.S. treasury bill, or the average rate of federal funds, whichever is higher. These indices are considered benchmarks for riskless investment transactions and therefore comprise a standard for the portfolio's rate of return. The investment program shall seek to augment rates of return above this level. In a diversified portfolio, measured losses are inevitable and must be considered within the context of the overall portfolio. 
    The investment performance of the city bond trust accounts portfolio shall have the objective of meeting or exceeding the average return of governments, U.S. treasury, intermediate-term bonds or the average return of governments, federal agencies, intermediate term bonds or a combination of both. The bond trust accounts are limited by law on the earnings allowed by arbitrage regulations. These regulations will take precedence over the indices when making a portfolio comparison. 
    Active portfolio management includes the practice of selling securities prior to maturity, using the proceeds to purchase other securities. Such transactions are called "swaps" and are performed for a variety of valid reasons. One reason such a "swap" is performed is to take advantage of the difference in relative yield between different types of securities and varying maturities. "Swap analysis" is the responsibility of the city investment officer and the decision to execute the "swap rests with him/her.

Sec. 2-406. - Allocation of assets. 
    Diversification of investments as to investment type and term to maturity serve to reduce both market risk and interest rate uncertainty. The city shall maintain prudent diversification of investments as to both issuer and term as outlined in this policy in the previous section. In the cash management portfolio the city should limit their maximum final stated maturities to five years. The bond trust accounts investment maturities should not exceed the stated final maturity of the bond issue as stated in the bond indentures. Deviation from the maturity restrictions are allowed only when specific circumstances warrant. To the extent possible, the city will attempt to match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. 
(Ord. No. 02-19, § 1, 6-3-2002) 
Sec. 2-407. - Highest yield requirements. 
    The city's funds shall be invested in instruments or accounts that yield the highest possible rate of return while providing the desired maturity schedule, level of liquidity, and necessary protection of principal as required by these policies and state law. 
(Ord. No. 02-19, § 1, 6-3-2002) 
Sec. 2-408. - Bidding requirements. 
    As prescribed by state statutes, the city shall solicit bids prior to the purchase or sale of any investment instrument. For each such investment transaction, a minimum of three phone bids will be obtained, with bid documentation maintained on file. It is the investment officer's responsibility to determine prudent maturity and liquidity, and to assess the potential for market gains or losses caused by fluctuating interest rates during the term of the investment. 
(Ord. No. 02-19, § 1, 6-3-2002) 
Sec. 2-409. - Pooling of assets. 
    To maximize the effective investment of assets, all general cash management funds needed for general obligations of the city should be pooled onto one account for investment purposes. All bond trust accounts will be kept separate from general cash management funds and are pooled according to type of account and fund. The income derived from these accounts will be distributed to the various funds based on their average balances on a periodic basis. 
(Ord. No. 02-19, § 1, 6-3-2002) 
Sec. 2-410. - Reporting. 
    The investment officer shall submit annually to the city council and city manager, an investment report outlining the city's investment transactions for the preceding year and describing the investment position of the city as of the date of the report.

This report will include the market value, book value and unrealized gain or loss of the securities in the portfolio. Earnings on investments shall be compared to benchmark indicators to indicate relative portfolio performance. 
(Ord. No. 02-19, § 1, 6-3-2002) 
Sec. 2-411. - Internal controls. 
    The investment officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the city are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The internal control structure shall be designed to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that (1) the cost of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived; and (2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by management. State and local laws require an annual audit of the financial records of the city. That audit will include a review of all investment activity for the year to review compliance with these investment procedures. Included in the audit review will also be a review of internal controls as pertains to investment of the city funds and appropriate investment documentation. Annual audit procedures will also include verification of collateral held by the city for both bank deposits in excess of F.D.I.C. insurance and repurchase agreement transactions.

    The investment officer and employees involved in the investment process shall not be liable for any error in judgment or any act or omission performed or omitted to be performed in good faith and without negligence so long as the investments are made in full compliance with these policies.

(b)  Further, after a public hearing and recommendation by the planning board, the board of zoning appeals may, by resolution, grant waiver of part or all of the minimum distance requirement set forth in section 4-32, subsections (3) and (4), if it is demonstrated by the applicant and determined by the board of zoning appeals that the site proposed for the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages is separated from another such establishment by features or circumstances which offset or limit the necessity for such minimum distance requirement. The board of zoning appeals decision to waive part or all of the distance requirement shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The establishment is located within a shopping center containing a gross leasable floor area of at least 25,000 square feet.

(d)  Upon receipt of the application and the applicable fee, established by city council, public hearing dates shall be scheduled before the planning board and board of zoning appeals for a determination on the proposed waiver. The applicant shall notify, by certified mail, the owners, or representatives of the subject school, childcare center, public library, church, public park, public playground, or other establishment(s) of the application at least 15 days prior to the public hearings; and evidence of such notification shall be supplied to the community development director.

In such circumstances, the city shall bill the property owner or his/her agent for all charges and expenses incurred to eliminate these potentially unsafe conditions by any means necessary.

(Ord. No. 06-18, § 5, 12-4-2006) 
Sec. 6-85. - Technical specification for seawalls and revetments. 
    The city shall adopt by resolution the technical specification that establishes minimum performance based standards for seawall and revetment construction and repair. Site-specific designs and specifications are required and shall be appropriate for conditions at each location and construction materials employed. All seawalls and revetments constructed, reconstructed, repaired, or altered in the city after the effective date of this division shall meet or exceed this technical specification as follows: 
(1)  Minor repairs to the seawall or revetment that do not require physical alteration to the existing structural support system are exempt from the technical specification. 
(2)  Major repairs to the seawall or revetment that requires replacement of any portion of the structural support system, shall comply with all applicable provisions of the technical specification for that portion of the seawall or revetment. Repairs shall restore the original integrity of the seawall or revetment. 
(3)  Reconstruction of any seawall or revetment requiring complete reinstallation of the sheet pile portion of the structural support system, or any new seawall or revetment section installed adjacent to or independent from any existing seawall or revetment shall comply with all applicable provisions of the technical specification for that portion of the seawall or revetment. 
(4)  Seawalls shall be placed so that the waterward face of the wall is coincidental with the platted property or bulkhead line, if one exists, or at the intersection of the mean high water line with the existing shoreline. Upon specific request to the city, an administrative variance to the above may be approved by the city for seawalls that were originally constructed with an intentional offset from the property line provided the offset shall not be increased. 
(5)  The placing of a new seawall waterward (in front of) of an existing seawall is permitted in artificially created waterway such as a manmade canal/basin or in a natural or man-altered waterbody in accordance with 40E-4.051(4)(a), (b), and (c) of Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.), pursuant to the following conditions: 
a.  A Florida registered professional engineer certifies the new seawall design. 
b.  The new seawall does not extend more then 18 inches from the waterward face of the existing vertical seawall location. 
c.  The new seawall is placed vertically plumb. 
d.  Placing a seawall in front of an existing seawall shall only be permitted once. 
e.  Existing seawall sections that interfere with new seawall location shall be removed. 
f.  The new seawall shall include an adequate "closure" at each property line. 
(6)  The placing of a new seawall waterward (in front of) of an existing seawall where the seawall is located on sovereign submerged land (Barfield Bay) may qualify for a consent by rule (18-21.005(l)(b), F.A.C.) or a letter of consent (18-21.005(l)(c), F.A.C.) if it meets the regulatory exemption criteria listed in these rules. 
(7)  The top of cap elevation for all replacement and new seawalls and top elevation for all other revetments shall be equal to or greater than 3.2 feet N.A.V.D. but not exceeding 4.2 feet N.A.V.D. If the top of a seawall cap is constructed at an elevation differing from the adjacent property owner top of cap elevation by greater than one foot, then a return wall is required to sufficiently provide for the break in grade at the property line. 
(8)  The city manager or his designee may approve after-the-fact height encroachments of up to three inches for seawall caps for which a certificate of completion or a final development order has not been granted. After-the-fact encroachments are subject to the following criteria: 
a.  A survey must be prepared and certified by a Florida licensed registered engineer or surveyor identifying the exact location and size of the encroachment; 
b.  A statement of how and when the encroachment was created; 
c.  A statement of current ownership and ownership at the time the encroachment was created; 
d.  A letter of no objection from each adjacent property owner; 
e.  Any other factors which may show the encroachment was not intentionally created; and 
f.  Payment of any applicable fees imposed by the city council. 
(9)  A property owner desiring shoreline protection may request permission from the city to construct a seawall or revetment. In general, revetments would be constructed adjoining natural bodies of water (if allowed by the State of Florida), and seawalls adjoining manmade channels, or canals. 
(10)  A building permit is required for all seawall and revetment work. The building and planning divisions shall review the plans and specifications to determine compliance with the minimum requirements set forth herein. 
a.  For minor repairs only, with a value of less that $2,500.00, the application for permit shall include a drawing prepared by a licensed contractor with the legal description of the property signed by the owner or contractor as owner's representative. 
b.  For all other seawall and revetment repair, alteration, reconstruction, or replacement, the application for permit shall include two copies of scaled plans and specifications signed and sealed by a professional engineer registered in the State of Florida including the legal description of the property. 
c.  Seawall construction shall be subject to inspections by the city manager or his designee or the city manager may accept inspections by a licensed Florida professional engineer in lieu of city staff, for the purpose of determining conformance of seawall construction with the permitted plans and this division. A schedule of quality control and inspections is given in the technical specification. 
d.  Note there are State of Florida environmental regulations (F.A.C. ch. 40E-4) governing seawall and revetment work including exemptions to the state permit process. It remains the responsibility of the property owner where seawall and revetment work is to be performed to comply with all state and federal regulations governing the work. Additionally, the property owner shall comply with state and federal regulations concerning vegetation affected by the work, including the restoration of mangroves. 
(11)  Existing seawall construction does not coordinate with location of perpendicular platted property lines throughout the city. Accordingly, a burden exists on the property owners to cooperate during seawall repair or replacement. If the permitted seawall or revetment repair or replacement would require entry onto neighboring properties to properly locate and construct the seawall expansion, joint tie-in or return wall, the owner seeking the repair or replacement should seek permission from the neighboring property owner. If said neighbor owner consents to entry, a temporary construction easement or license should be obtained of approximately six feet by 17 feet adjacent to the seawall and common boundary to accommodate the construction. The property owner undertaking the repairs shall be responsible for restoring the neighboring property to pre-work condition prior to receipt of a certificate of completion. These repairs shall be completed prior to final inspection. Depending on job site conditions, or if the adjoining property owner does not consent to entry, the seawall to be replaced or repaired shall include a return wall. 
(12)  Seawalls shall include adequate provision for pipe penetrations through the seawall as required by the city. The seawall design details for such penetrations shall be provided as part of the engineered design seawall plans for building permit.

You may move, remove or dispose of asbestos-containing materials on a residential building where you occupy the building and the building is not for sale or lease, or the building is a farm outbuilding on your property. If you sell or lease such building within 1 year after the asbestos abatement is complete, the law will presume that you intended to sell or lease the property at the time the work was done, which is a violation of this exemption. You may not hire an unlicensed person as your contractor. Your work must be done according to all local, state and federal laws and regulations which apply to asbestos abatement projects. It is your responsibility to make sure that people employed by you have licenses required by state law and by county or municipal licensing ordinances.

Buildings within projects which have water management routing and storage facilities designed and built for a 25-year, three (3) day storm event in accordance with South Florida Water Management District's criteria may use a finish floor elevation in accordance with the project's water management designed 100-year zero discharge elevation or the FIRM elevation, whichever is higher. 
2.  Buildings which are not within projects having a water management storage facility designed and built for a 25-year, three (3) day storm event in accordance with South Florida Water Management District's criteria shall use a finish floor elevation of 18 inches above the adjacent roadway crown elevation or the FIRM elevation, whichever is higher. 
g)  On parcels where unusual topographic conditions exist and the above standards conditions cannot be reasonably applied, the Building Official will consider requests to decrease the finished-floor elevation. All requests will require an analysis by a Florida registered professional engineer of the 25-year, three (3) day storm event and the 100-year, three (3) day storm event, using zero discharge for the entire drainage basin in which the proposed structure is located. Reductions may be allowed on the basis of the analysis, but in no case shall the finished floor be less than the FIRM.] 
118.5.9 Lot pre-inspection for new Single Family and Seawall permits. 
Pre-inspection of the lot(s) is required, prior to the issuance of any permit, for any new Construction project, major addition project, seawall replacement, or seawall maintenance project. The inspection will verify the current condition of the adjoining properties. It will proactively identify and storm-water drainage issues. Findings will be submitted to the permit applicant as a review comment or as a condition of the permit, at the Building Official's discretion. 
118.5.8 Prohibited Materials. Materials that have the potential to become wind driven missiles shall be prohibited. Example: Aggregate such as that found on tar and gravel roofs, or gravel used as ballast on roofs. This includes roofing, re-roofing and any material that is likely to be misplaced and propelled by strong winds. 
118.6 Additional requirements - General. 
118.6.1 Weathered materials. 
118.6.1.1 Materials shall be protected against the weather and insects prior to and during construction. Materials that could be damaged shall be protected from the time they are delivered until completion of the final inspection. Materials that have been adversely affected by the elements shall be replaced. 
118.6.1.2 Trusses must be elevated off the ground and be erected within twenty-five (25) days of delivery. Trusses of questionable integrity shall be replaced. 
NOTE: Every effort should be made to protect the end product from the adverse effects of water. Plywood buckling, delaminating, and excessive microbiological growth (fungus) can be prevented without extraordinary effort. Coordinating truss deliveries, house wrap, window installation, and dry-in procedures will greatly reduce premature weathering. 
118.6.2 Restricted hours on certain activities. 
Pile driving and demolition activities are only allowed between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday. No pile driving or demolition activities may take place on Sundays or City observed holidays.

ARTICLE VI. - POST-DISASTER REDEVELOPMENT PLAN 

Sec. 6-171. - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the intent of the city to identify opportunities to mitigate future damages from major or catastrophic disasters through the prudent management and enforcement of community reconstruction. To further this intent, the city will make every effort to develop its capacity to identify and coordinate various post-disaster recovery and reconstruction resources while at the same time ensuring maximum local control over the recovery and reconstruction process. 
    Following a major or catastrophic disaster, sufficient time must be provided to conduct damage assessments, classify and categorize individual structure damage, and evaluate the effectiveness and enforcement of the existing building code. It is further the intent of the city to allow rebuilding and reconstruction in an orderly manner by controlling the issuance of building permits, development orders and site plans in order to manage the location, timing, and sequence of reconstruction and repair. 
(Ord. No. 01-24, § 1, 10-1-2001) 
Sec. 6-172. - Definitions. 
    The following terms and definitions apply for the purposes of this division: 
    Building value means the latest assessment of all improvements on a parcel of land as recorded in the Collier County Property Appraiser's file before the structure was damaged. 
    Catastrophic disaster is defined as an event that overwhelms local response capabilities and will require mutual aid, state response, federal disaster relief programs, and activation of the state and federal response plans. 
    Chief building official means the chief of building services who is hereby designated by the city council to implement, administer and enforce the building permit moratorium provision of this division. 
    Current regulatory standards for new construction includes consideration of the following: Density, floodplain management, building code, land development code and comprehensive plan requirements, site location, and parking requirements. 
    Damage assessment means a systematic procedure for evaluating damage to public and private property, based on current replacement cost. The assessment may be used to determine if the damaged area can qualify for federal or state disaster assistance. 
    Damage assessment team means a local group of qualified individuals charged with providing an initial assessment of damage to private and public properties in the aftermath of a significant natural or man-made event. 
    Destroyed structure means a structure that is total loss or damaged to such an extent that repairs are not technically or economically feasible. The indicator for this category is if the cost to repair exceeds 50 percent of the replacement cost at the time of damage or destruction. 
    Development order means any order, permit, determination, or action granting with conditions an application for any final development order, building permit, temporary use permit, temporary construction and development permit, spot survey, electrical permit, plumbing permit, boat-dock permit, septic tank permit, right-of-way permit, construction approval for infrastructure (including water, sewer, grading, paving) development of regional impact (DRI) development order, zoning ordinance amendment, comprehensive plan amendment, flood variance, coastal construction control line variance, vegetation removal permits, agricultural clearing permits, site development plan approval, subdivision approval (including plats, plans, variances and amendments), rezoning PUD amendment, certification, conditional use, variance, or any other official action of the city having the effect of permitting development as defined in the land development code. 
    Major damaged structure means a structure that can be made habitable with extensive repairs. Damage may include foundation, roof structure, and major structural components. The indicator for this category is if the cost to repair is greater than 20 percent and up to and including 50 percent of the replacement cost at the time of damage. 
    Major disaster is defined as an event that may require mutual aid, state response assistance and federal disaster relief programs. 
    Minor damaged structure means a structure that can be made habitable in a short period of time with minimal repairs. Damages may include doors, windows, floors, roofs, central air conditioners, and other minor structural damage. The indicator for this category is if the cost to repair is 20 percent or less than the replacement cost at the time of damage. 
    Minor disaster means a structure that is likely to be within the response capabilities of local government and to result in only a minimal need for state or federal assistance. 
    Replacement cost means the actual cost to repair, reconstruct, rebuild or replace a damaged structure. It will not include the following parts of a structure or items not considered a permanent part of the structure: building plans, surveys, permits, sidewalks, pools, screens, sheds, gazebos, fences, furniture and carpeting. For purposes of this division, the replacement cost will be compared to the structure's replacement value to determine the percent of the structural damage. 
    Replacement value of a structure means the market building value contained in the Collier County Property Appraiser's File multiplied by one of the following factors: 120 percent in a major disaster; 150 percent in a catastrophic disaster. The structure's owner can opt to establish replacement value by hiring a state licensed contractor to make such determinations rather than use the formula stated in this definition. 
    Structure means anything constructed or erected requires a fixed location on the ground, or attached to something having a fixed location on or in the ground.

Sec. 6-177. - Determination of damage and buildback policy. 
(a)  Determination of damage. The primary task of the local damage assessment team is to identify structures which have been damaged as a result of the disaster. The city damage assessment team will catalogue and report to the chief of building official those structures which have: 
(1)  Been destroyed; 
(2)  Received major damage; and 
(3)  Received minor damage. 
The chief building official will then, as may be necessary, inspect the damaged structures and place each structure in one of the damage categories provided for by this division. The assessment will also serve as a basis for determining if federal and state disaster declaration are warranted. 
(b)  Buildback policy. Structures which have been damaged by natural or manmade disasters to the extent that the cost of their reconstruction or repair exceed 50 percent of the replacement value of the structure may be reconstructed, but in accordance with the legally documented actual use, density, size, style and type of construction including square footage existing at the time of destruction, thereby allowing such structures to be rebuilt or replaced to the size, style, and type of their original construction, including their original square footage; provided, however, that the affected structure, as rebuilt or replaced, complies with all applicable federal and state regulations and local regulations which do not preclude reconstruction otherwise intended by this policy. In accordance with this policy: 
(1)  Structures damaged up to and including 50 percent of their replacement value at the time of disaster can be rebuilt to their original conditions, with repair work subject to current building and life safety codes. 
(2)  Structures damages by the disaster by more than 50 percent of their replacement value at the time of disaster can be rebuilt to their original square footage and density, provided that they comply with: 
a.  Federal requirements for elevation above the 100-year flood level; 
b.  The city building code requirements for flood proofing; 
c.  Current building and life safety codes; 
d.  Marco Island and State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection Coastal Construction Control Line regulations; 
e.  Applicable disability access regulations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); and 
f.  Any required city zoning or other development regulations with the exception of existing density or intensity requirements established, unless compliance with such zoning or other development regulations would preclude reconstruction otherwise intended by this buildback policy as determined by city council. 
(3)  To minimize the need for individual variances or compliance determinations prior to reconstructions, the regulations of the city land development code affecting setbacks, parking, buffering and open space may be modified. City manager or designee may require documentation as to the actual uses, densities, and intensities existing prior to the disaster event and at the time of the original construction through such means as photographs, diagrams, plans, affidavits, and permits prior to authorizing modifications to the above requirements. These requirements may be modified as follows: 
a.  Front, rear, side or water body setbacks may be modified to permit the reconstruction of existing structures that are nonconforming with regard to a specific setback so long as the reconstruction will not result in an increase in the height of the structure as defined by the land development code; and the reconstruction will not result in a further diminution of the setback. City manager or designee may approve bay windows, chimneys and similar architectural features that may encroach further into the setback provided the encroachment does not protrude beyond the existing overhang of the building. 
b.  Front, rear, side, or water body setbacks may be modified to permit the construction of a handicapped access appurtenance to any reconstruction. 
c.  Front, rear, side or water body setbacks may be modified to allow for the replacement of stairs or decking that provides access into any reconstructed dwelling unit. 
d.  Front, rear, side or water body setbacks may be modified to legitimize minor existing encroachments in setbacks discovered at the time of reconstruction. 
e.  Buildings or structures that are not in compliance with current setback regulations and which can be proven to have been permitted prior to the adoption of such regulations shall be considered legally nonconforming and may also be reviewed by the city manager or designee under this section. 
f.  A diminution of the front yard setbacks on a collector or arterial roadway shall be consistent with future road widening requirements. 
(4)  The city manager or designee is authorized to modify the parking requirements for nonresidential uses as established by the city land development code. In no instance shall the parking requirements be modified where the reconstruction involves the increase of density or intensity of use. Such requirements may be modified under the following circumstances: 
a.  To improve ingress and egress to the site in accordance with the county access management plan. 
b.  To eliminate or reduce the instances where conditions require that parked vehicles back out onto the public streets. 
c.  To allow for the provision of handicapped parking spaces in accordance with the city land development code. 
(5)  The city manager or designee is authorized to modify the buffering or open space requirements of the land development code when such modifications and reconstruction will: 
a.  Accommodate modifications to existing parking or additional parking. 
b.  To accommodate changes as a result of reconstruction. 
In no instance shall buffering or open space areas be eliminated. 
(6)  Damaged structures may not be reconstructed at a more intense use or higher density than originally permitted by the comprehensive plan and land development code. No redevelopment at a higher density or more intense use will be permitted unless appropriate zoning, development review, building permit and other applicable land development approvals are granted through normal processes as set forth in the land development code. 
(Ord. No. 01-24, § 7, 10-1-2001)

(7)  Outstanding development order moratorium. 
a.  All development orders as defined herein issued prior to the disaster will be suspended for a minimum period of 30 days following the expiration of the initial building moratorium. Suspension of the development order means that no development order work is authorized and that no development order inspections by the community development department will be performed during the moratorium. Applications for development orders suspended under this section will be adjusted accordingly to reflect the time period covered by this 30-day moratorium. 
b.  The city reserves the right to reinspect any and all development order work in place prior to the disaster to verify that the work in place was not damaged during the disaster. In the event that the city determines that development order work in place was damaged during the disaster or suspects that damage occurred, the developer will be responsible for rework, removal, retesting, and uncovering work to facilitate inspection so that compliance with the development order documents and the land development code can be ensured. 
(8)  Site development plan, subdivision plat review, and zoning request moratorium. 
a.  Site plans which have been submitted to the city prior to the disaster will not be reviewed by the city staff for a period of 30 days following the expiration of the initial building moratorium.

(b)  The city manager has the authority to enter into consent agreements to facilitate compliance with the terms and conditions of this code. Such agreements may only be entered into prior to the violator's receipt of a notice of hearing of code enforcement action before the special magistrate. Any agreement must be in writing, signed by all parties, executed in recordable form, and entered into the record before the special magistrate. The special magistrate's review is a mere formality as the special magistrate has no authority to approve, deny, or modify the terms of any consent agreement under this subsection. The special magistrate is not responsible for the enforcement of compliance agreement obligations, however dependent upon the terms of such agreement the recordation before the special magistrate may establish the violator to increased penalties for repeat violation in the event of breach of the agreement or subsequent violations. At a minimum, the agreement must specifically set forth the terms and obligations necessary for the violator to comply with the code, indicate that the violator must pay all costs incurred in enforcing the agreement, and provide a specific time frame for the violator to comply. 
    The city, at its option, may record the consent agreement in the public records of Collier County. Upon fulfillment of its terms, the city will record a satisfaction or release of the agreement, if recorded. The violator must pay all costs of recording the original agreement and any satisfaction or release thereof. 
    If the violator fails to comply with the consent agreement, the city may: 
(1)  Pursue code enforcement action, in which case the consent agreement will automatically deemed to be null and void, will have no further effect on the parties, and will not be binding on the special magistrate; or 
(2)  Enforce the terms and conditions of the consent agreement in a court of competent jurisdiction by injunction or an action for specific performance, in the city's sole discretion.

(Ord. No. 16-02 , § 2, 3-7-2016) 
Sec. 18-62. - Intent and purpose. 
(a)  To provide for the regulation of fertilizers containing nitrogen or phosphorous and to provide specific management guidelines for fertilizer application in order to minimize the negative environmental effects said fertilizers have in and on the waterbodies within and surrounding the city. 
(b)  These guidelines and practices are established to help communities, developers, builders, contractors, businesses and homeowners be partners in improving and protecting Florida's environment. 
(c)  This article is based on the "Model Ordinance for Florida-Friendly Fertilizer Use" or equivalent as encouraged by F.S. § 403.9337. 
(d)  Nitrogen and phosphorous are essential ingredients for plant growth; however, overuse and improper application of these nutrients create water quality issues and pollute our treasured natural waters. They promote algae blooms and other excessive plant growth. Low to no phosphorus fertilizer and slow release nitrogen fertilizer, along with proper utilization, result in absorption by plants and lower levels of nitrogen and phosphorus reaching the water bodies within and surrounding the city and their associated watersheds. 
(e)  Certification and training, as required by article IV (Marco Island Lawn and Landscape Maintenance Registration Regulations), will result in increasing the knowledge of lawn and landscape maintenance professionals, and their customers, of:

ARTICLE VII. - SEXUAL OFFENDERS AND SEXUAL PREDATORS 

Sec. 18-200. - Sexual offender and sexual predator residency prohibition. 
(a)  Findings and intent. 
(1)  Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
(2)  It is the intent of this article to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly gather and can be stalked or observed in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. 
    Permanent residence means a place where the person abides, lodges, or resides for 14 or more consecutive days. 
    Reside or residence means to have a place of permanent residence or temporary residence. 
    Sexual offender shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in F.S. § 943.0435. 
    Sexual predator shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in F.S. § 775.21. 
    Temporary residence means a place where the person abides, lodges, or resides for a period of 14 or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and which is not the person's permanent address, or a place where the person routinely abides, lodges, or resides for a period of four or more consecutive or nonconsecutive days in any month and which is not the person's permanent residence.

(2)  This subsection is effective upon adoption of the ordinance and applies to illicit connections made prior to March 5, 2018 (the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived) regardless of whether made under a permit or other authorization, or whether permissible under laws or practices applicable or prevailing at the time the connection was made. 
(3)  A person is considered to be in violation of this section, if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the city's MS4 or allows such a connection to continue. 
(g)  Violation of permits. Any discharge into the city's MS4 in violation of any federal, state, or local governmental law, rule, regulation or permit is prohibited, except those discharges set forth in this article or in accordance with a valid NPDES permit. 
(h)  Stormwater discharges from commercial, industrial or construction activities to the MS4 or regulated waters. 
(1)  Stormwater from areas of any commercial activity, industrial, or construction activity shall be controlled, treated and managed on-site using best management practices so as not to cause an illicit or illegal discharge to the city's MS4 or regulated waters. 
(2)  All erosion, pollutant, and sediment controls required by city code or by any applicable local, state, or federal permit, including elements of a stormwater pollution prevention plan required under an NPDES permit, shall be properly implemented, installed, operated, and maintained. 
(3)  Authorized discharges to the city's MS4 shall be controlled so that they do not impair the operation of the city's MS4 or contribute to the failure meet any applicable local, state, or federal law or regulation. 
(4)  Authorized discharges to regulated waters as defined by the Clean Water Act, shall be controlled so that they do not adversely impact the quality or beneficial uses of those waters, or result in violation of any applicable local, state, or federal law or regulation. 
(5)  Any person who has been issued an NPDES permit authorizing discharges to the city's MS4 shall submit a complete copy of the permit to the city's building department within 30 days after March 5, 2018 (the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived), or within 30 days after the issuance of a permit. 
(i)  Authorized exemptions. The commencement, conduct, or continuance of any illicit or illegal discharge to the city's MS4 is prohibited, except as described as follows:

(k)  Emergency conditions. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, whenever the city manager, or said manager's designee, or as otherwise provided pursuant to section 10-3 of this Code, determines that emergency conditions or activities require immediate action to protect the public health, safety or welfare, or to provide for compliance with these regulations, city approved construction plans, city inspectors and employees are authorized to enter at a reasonable time in or upon any property, consistent with subsection (l) of this provision, for the purpose of testing, inspecting, investigating, measuring, sampling and correcting such emergency conditions. Failure to admit personnel responding to emergency conditions, shall constitute a separate violation of this section only if actual violation is determined. 
(2)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency conditions. The city manager, or said manager's designee, may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to persons. 
(3)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this section may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. It is considered an offense of this section, if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the city. 
(l)  Inspection and monitoring for compliance. City code inspectors may request access for inspection of facilities discharging or suspected of discharging to the city's MS4 to effectuate the provisions of this section and to investigate violations or potential violations of any of the terms herein. 
(m)  Reporting requirements. Illicit discharges to the city's MS4 are prohibited. Any person owning or occupying a premise or facility who has knowledge of a discharge of pollutants from those premises or facilities or other type of evidence which might result in a violation of the prohibitions found in this section shall immediately take action to abate the discharge of pollutants and shall notify the department and city code enforcement department within 24 hours of the discharge of pollutants. The initial notification may be by telephone, but the person responsible shall submit a written report within 72 hours of discovery. The written report shall include a description of the discharge volume, content, frequency, discharge point location to the MS4, measures taken or to be taken to terminate the discharge, and the name, address and telephone number of the person who may be contacted for additional information. 
(n)  Penalty; additional remedies. Enforcement of this article shall be conducted pursuant to F.S. ch. 162. Penalties for violations of this article shall be as specified therein, or any other appropriate remedy provided by law. The city may seek enforcement action against the owner or developer of record, any person in actual or constructive possession, and any person or entity responsible for carrying out any prohibited action. The provisions of this section are an additional and supplemental means of enforcing city codes and ordinances. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city from enforcing this code by injunctive relief, or by any other means provided by law. 
(o)  Appeals. Appeals relating to any administrative decision or determination concerning implementation or application of the provisions of this section shall be filed in writing within 30 calendar days after the decision is rendered by the city council, city manager (or said manager's designee), department director, or building official, all as provided for herein.

(Ord. No. 18-07 , § 5, 3-5-2018) 
Sec. 18-213. - Stormwater pollution prevention for construction. 
(a)  Activities; purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city through the regulation of potential pollution from construction activities. These activities would include connections or areas not connected to the city's MS4 system. 
(1)  No building permit shall be issued for any building in the city, unless a site plan is submitted with the application for such building permit illustrating the location of driveways, sidewalks if required by this code, parking strips consistent with this code and perimeter retaining structures or a surface water management plan which provides for containment of runoff on-site with surplus routed to rights-of-way or right-of-way swales for drainage as applicable. 
(2)  Site plans for construction projects in all zoning districts shall be reviewed and administratively approved by staff for on-site erosion control per applicable code provisions outlined herein. Appropriate erosion control devices must be planned, implemented, and maintained in accordance with the best management practices (BMPs) described in the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's "Erosion & Sediment Control Designer & Reviewer Manual," most current edition, and required as part of any permit review, approval, and compliance. If approved BMPs are not working properly, it is the responsibility of the developer or contractor to utilize new BMP methods as necessary to provide erosion and sediment control. 
(b)  Erosion and sediment control. Construction activity can result in the generation of significant amounts of pollutants, which may reach surface or ground waters. One of the primary pollutants of surface waters is sediment due to erosion. Excessive quantities of sediment which reach water bodies of floodplains have been shown to adversely affect their physical, biological, and chemical properties. Transported sediment can obstruct stream channels, reduce the hydraulic capacity of water bodies of floodplains, reduce the design capacity of culverts and other works, and eliminate benthic invertebrates and fish spawning substrates by siltation. Excessive suspended sediments reduce light penetration and, therefore, reduce primary productivity. Therefore, the minimum standards set forth in subsection (c) below shall apply to any construction activity within the city. 
(c)  Minimum standards. The minimum standards referenced in subsection (b) include: 
(1)  Sediment basins and traps, perimeter dikes, sediment barriers and other measures intended to trap sediment shall be constructed as a first step in any land-disturbing activity and shall be made functional before upslope land disturbance takes place; 
(2)  All sediment control measures are to be adjusted to meet field conditions at the time of construction and be constructed prior to any grading or disturbance of existing surface material on the balance of site. Perimeter sediment barriers shall be constructed to prevent sediment or trash from flowing or floating on to adjacent properties; 
(3)  Permanent or temporary soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas within seven days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site. Where practicable, temporary soil stabilization shall be applied within seven days to denuded areas that may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than 30 days. Permanent stabilization shall be applied to areas that are to be left undisturbed for more than 90 days; 
(4)  During construction of a project, soil stock piles shall be stabilized or protected with sediment trapping measures. The developer is responsible for the temporary protection and permanent stabilization of all soil stockpiles on site as well as soil intentionally transported from the project site; 
(5)  A permanent vegetative cover shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized. Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until a ground cover is achieved that, in the opinion of the city's reviewer, is uniform and mature enough to survive and will inhibit erosion; 
(6)  Stabilization measures shall be applied to earthen structures, such as dams, dikes and diversions immediately after installation; 
(7)  After any significant rainfall, sediment control structures will be inspected for integrity. Any damaged devices shall be corrected immediately; 
(8)  Concentrated runoff shall not flow down, cut, or fill slopes, unless contained within an adequate temporary or permanent channel, flume or slope drain structure; 
(9)  Whenever water seeps from a slope face, adequate drainage or other protection shall be provided; 
(10)  Sediment will be prevented from entering any storm drain system, ditch, or channel. All storm sewer inlets that are made operable during construction shall be protected so that sediment-laden water cannot enter the conveyance system without first being filtered, or otherwise treated, to remove sediment; 
(11)  Before temporary or newly constructed stormwater conveyance channels are made operational, adequate outlet protection, and any required temporary or permanent channel lining, shall be installed in both the conveyance channel and receiving channel; 
(12)  When work in a live watercourse is performed, precautions shall be taken to minimize encroachment, control sediment transport and stabilize the work area to the greatest extent possible during construction. Non-erodible material shall be used for the construction of causeways and cofferdams. Earthen fill may be used for these structures if armored by non-erodible cover materials; 
(13)  When a live watercourse must be crossed by construction vehicles, a temporary stream crossing constructed of non-erodible material shall be provided; 
(14)  The bed and banks of a watercourse shall be stabilized immediately after work in the watercourse is completed; 
(15)  Periodic inspection and maintenance of all sediment control structures must be provided to ensure the intended purpose is accomplished. The developer shall be continually responsible for all sediment leaving the property. Sediment control measures shall be in working condition at the end of each working day; 
(16)  Underground utility lines shall be installed in accordance with the following standards in addition to other applicable criteria: 
a.  No more than 500 linear feet of trench may be opened at one time; 
b.  Excavated material shall be placed on the uphill side of trenches; 
c.  Effluent from dewatering operations shall be filtered or passed through an approved sediment trapping device, or both, and discharged in a manner that does not adversely affect flowing streams or off-site property; and 
d.  Re-stabilization shall be accomplished in accordance with these regulations; 
(17)  Where construction vehicle access routes intersect paved public roads, provisions shall be made to minimize the transport of sediment by tracking onto the paved surface. Where sediment is transported onto a public road surface with curbs and gutters, the road shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each work day. Sediment shall be removed from the roads by shoveling or sweeping and transported to a sediment control disposal area. Street washing shall be allowed only after sediment is removed in this manner. This provision shall apply to individual subdivision lots as well as to larger land-disturbing activities; 
(18)  All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be removed within 30 days after final site stabilization or after the temporary measures are no longer needed, in the opinion of the city's reviewer. Disturbed soil areas resulting from the disposition of temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation; 
(19)  Properties and waterways downstream from construction sites shall be protected from sediment deposition and erosion; 
(20)  Phased projects should be cleared in conjunction with construction of each phase; 
(21)  The city permit reviewer may approve modifications or alternate plans to these erosion control criteria due to site specific conditions. 
(d)  Development of an erosion and sediment control plan. An erosion and sediment control plan must be submitted as part of the building permit application that include land disturbing activities. This plan and its implementation is a way of providing reasonable assurance that water quality standards will not be violated during the construction phase of a project.

All members shall be required to complete a medical examination as may be prescribed by the city, and provide complete and accurate information concerning their health status as requested by the board. Any material misstatements or omissions of requested health or medical information by an applicant or member shall be grounds for denial of benefits. Based upon medical evidence of any pre-existing adverse health condition, resulting from the prescribed examination or other medical records or history, the board may determine any member ineligible for disability benefits hereunder, as related to such pre-existing condition. A member may be declared ineligible for disability benefits at the time of the initial examination provided in this section, or at a later date if the committee establishes that a condition existed at the time of the member's employment or date of membership. The procedures followed and the determination of the board as to a pre-existing condition shall be on a uniform, non-discriminatory basis, with all members in similar situations being treated alike.

The board may also engage such professional, technical or other advisers as it deems necessary to administer the pension plan. The board may choose to use the city's actuary or other professional, technical, or other advisors, but must do so only under terms and conditions acceptable to the board. The compensation of all persons engaged by the board and all other expenses of the board necessary for the operation of the pension plan shall be paid from the pension fund at such rates and in such amounts as the board shall agree.

Each firefighter who is a member in the pension plan and who shall have become totally and permanently disabled while an active member of the pension plan to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 42 percent of his average monthly salary at the time of disability, whichever is greater, minus any benefits that may be paid from time to time by any policy or plan of disability insurance or benefits maintained by the city or the pension plan. A firefighter must apply for benefits under such disability insurance or benefits as a condition of receiving disability benefits from this pension plan. 
(b)  Conditions presumed suffered in line of duty. Any condition or impairment of health of a firefighter caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such firefighter shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. A condition or impairment of health caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment and results in disability or death shall be presumed to have occurred in the line of duty, unless the contrary be shown by competent evidence, in accordance with F.S. § 112.181, as amended from time to time. 
(c)  Disability benefits off-duty. Each firefighter who is a member in the pension plan with ten or more years of credited service who becomes totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability was not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter, shall be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, or 25 percent of his average monthly salary at the date of disability, whichever is greater, minus any benefits that may be paid from time to time by any policy or plan of disability insurance or benefits maintained by the city or the pension plan. Provided that effective July 1, 2000, service time required to qualify for non-service related disability benefits shall be reduced from ten to eight or more years of credited service. A firefighter must apply for benefits under such disability insurance or benefits as a condition of receiving disability benefits from this pension plan. 
(d)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. A member may be disqualified from receiving disability benefits based on a pre-existing condition as determined by the board in accordance with this pension plan. Each firefighter who is claiming disability benefits must also establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants, or alcohol. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots, or civil insurrections. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while committing a crime. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
(5)  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a firefighter with the city shall have terminated. 
(6)  Willful, wanton or gross negligence of the member. 
(7)  Injury or disease sustained by the firefighter while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(e)  Medical examination requirement. A member shall not be eligible for disability benefits unless and until he undergoes a medical examination by a qualified physician or physicians selected by the board for that purpose. The member will be required to authorize the release of all relevant medical records to the physician or physicians who conduct the medical examination. Any member receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be periodically reexamined by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that a member receiving disability benefits is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that the member is able to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, disability benefit payments to the member shall be discontinued. The cost of the medical examination and/or re-examination of a member claiming and/or receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the pension fund. 
(f)  Reentry into service after recovery from disability. If a member recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a firefighter, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for purposes of the pension plan. 
(g)  Authority of board. The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(h)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. Disability retirement benefits shall be payable for 120 months or the member's lifetime, whichever is longer, or until the member recovers from disability, in which case the last payment shall be the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery. 
(i)  Workers' compensation. When a member is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to F.S. ch. 440, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefit received from both exceed 100 percent of the member's final monthly salary, excluding overtime, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the member does not exceed 100 percent of such salary; provided that in no event shall the resulting disability retirement income payable from the pension plan be less than the member's accrued benefit or 42 percent of average monthly salary, whichever is greater. In the case of a lump sum workers' compensation settlement, the disability retirement income payable from the pension plan shall be adjusted as follows: 
(1)  The amount of the lump sum settlement shall be divided by the participant's remaining life expectancy (in months) as determined using standard actuarial tables approved by the actuary for the pension plan. 
(2)  If the number obtained in subsection (1) above, when added to the participant's monthly disability retirement income from the pension plan, exceeds the participant's final monthly compensation on the date of disability, the amount of the excess shall be deducted from the participant's monthly disability retirement income from the pension plan, for the duration of the participant's remaining life expectancy as determined in subsection (1) above. 
(3)  If the number obtained in subsection (1) above, when added to the participant's monthly disability retirement income from the pension plan, does not exceed the participant's final monthly compensation on the date of disability, there shall be no reduction of the participant's disability retirement income from the pension plan. 
(Ord. No. 00-08, § 2, 7-17-2000; Ord. No. 00-12, § 1, 9-25-2000; Ord. No. 01-17, § 2, 10-1-2001) 
Sec. 22-60. - Termination of employment prior to retirement. 
    If a member terminates city employment and is not eligible for any other benefits under this pension plan, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions, or the member may leave them deposited with the pension fund for up to five years following termination. Provided that the vesting period for members in this plan for this benefit shall be reduced from ten years to six years effective July 1, 2001, provided that the member is "employed in a regularly established position" on that date. If not so employed on that date a member must be "employed in a covered position for at least one work year after July 1, 2001." 
(2)  If the member has ten or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement based upon the member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of termination, payable commencing at the member's normal or early retirement date; provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided the member survives to his normal or early retirement date. Provided that the vesting period for members in this plan for this benefit shall be reduced from ten years to six years effective July 1, 2001, provided that the member is "employed in a regularly established position" on that date. If not so employed on that date a member must be "employed in a covered position for at least one work year after July 1, 2001." 
(Ord. No. 00-08, § 2, 7-17-2000; Ord. No. 01-17, § 3, 10-1-2001) 
Sec. 22-61. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable as specified in this pension plan, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the member for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount payable to the member during the lifetime of the member and, following the death of the member, 100 percent, 66 2/3 percent, 75 percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the pension plan, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option provided in subsection (a) of this section, will designate the joint pensioner or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the pension plan in the event of the member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner or beneficiary and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, such member may thereafter change his designated joint pensioner or beneficiary up to two times as provided in F.S. § 175.333 without the approval of the board of trustees or the current joint annuitant or beneficiary. The member need not provide proof of the good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed, and the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed need not be living. Upon any such new election, the member's final pension benefit shall be recalculated accordingly by the actuary with all costs resulting directly from the new election borne solely by the member. 
(c)  The consent of a member's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the pension plan shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a member's beneficiary or joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the board shall adjust the member's monthly benefit by application of actuarial calculations to insure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the member's then-current benefit. Any such member shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses and shall make repayment of any overage of previously-paid pension benefits as a result of said recalculations. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the member, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the member subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 22-62. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefit, if any, will be determined under section 22-58. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the pension plan, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement and within 90 days after the death of the beneficiary. 
(3)  If both the retired member and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection a of this section, the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 22-62. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of section 22-57(a), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(f)  A member may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the remaining monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $3,500.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the pension plan with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(h)  "Share plan." There is hereby provided, in addition to all other benefits provided in this article, an annual supplemental retirement benefit, which shall consist of an individual share account for each member of the pension plan employed as a firefighter for the City of Marco Island on or after the effective date hereof. The amount of which shall be determined annually, based upon the receipt by the fund of any "additional premium tax revenues," as defined in F.S. § 175.351(1)(b). By December 1 of each year (or, if the premium tax revenues are received after October 2, within 60 days after receipt of the premium tax revenues from the state), each actively employed member of the pension plan employed as a firefighter for the City of Marco Island on or after the effective date hereof, shall be paid a supplemental retirement benefit determined as follows: 
Initial crediting. No later than 180 days after the adoption of the ordinance from which this section derives, each member's share account shall be credited retroactively from the member's date of hire to September 30, 2007. Each member who was employed during this time as a firefighter shall receive one share for each month of credited service as defined in [section] 22-52, earned during the preceding fiscal year. The total value of each share shall be determined annually based on the total number of members at that time divided into the total additional premium tax revenues received during said fiscal year, plus interest at the pension plan's actual rate of investment return calculated from the pension plan's receipt of said revenue to September 30 of that year, to determine the amount to be initially credited to the share account of each eligible member. It is the intent of the city council that the initial payment under this section shall be made based on each separate year's accumulation and the status of each eligible member in those years. The crediting of shares for each year shall be based on the excess premium taxes received in that particular year and shall be payable only to persons who were eligible to receive a payment in the particular year in which the taxes were received. For purposes of implementing this share plan, a member's annual accrued benefit shall mean the amount allocable each fiscal year up to the corresponding annual prescribed Internal Revenue Code Section 415 limitation, beyond which any excess amount shall be deemed to accrue in the subsequent fiscal year. 
Crediting effective December 2008 and thereafter. No later than December 1, 2008, and December 1 of each year thereafter, or as soon thereafter as practicable, each eligible member's share account shall be credited as follows: 
Each member who was employed during the preceding calendar year shall receive one share for each month of credited service, as defined in section 22-52, earned during the preceding calendar year. The total number of shares thus determined shall be divided into the additional premium tax revenues received during said year, plus interest at the pension plan's actual rate of investment return, calculated from the pension plan's receipt of said revenue to December 31 of that year, to determine the amount to be credited to the share account of each eligible member. 
Effective January 1 of each calendar year, each member's share account shall be credited or debited with earnings based upon the amount in the share account at the close of the next preceding calendar year (e.g., the amount credited in 2008 shall be based upon the amount in the share account as [of] December 31, 2006, since the interest on the additional premiums tax revenues credited to the account during 2007 was already added to the amount distributed in 2007) at a rate equal to the pension plan's net investment return for the preceding calendar year (e.g., effective January 1, 2008, the amount in each share account as of December 31, 2006, shall be credited with the net investment rate of return for 2007.) Upon attaining 12 years of credited service, a member may thereafter make a one-time irrevocable election to have interest credited to his or her share account at the rate earned by the pension fund from a money market mutual fund selected by the board of trustees rather than credited or debited at the pension fund's actual rate of return. 
A member with at least 12 years of credited service upon termination of employment shall be eligible to receive the balance in the member's share account upon actual termination of employment with the city. 
A member with at least six but less than 12 years of credited service upon termination of employment shall be eligible to receive one-half of the balance in the member's share account upon termination of employment. No benefit shall be payable to a member who terminates covered employment with less than six years of credited service. The share account balances of such non-vested terminated members shall be redistributed into the allocation for the next fiscal year. The designated beneficiary of a member who dies shall receive the accumulated total of the deceased member's share account and a member awarded a disability pension from the pension plan shall receive the accumulated total of the disabled member's share account. There shall be no forfeiture of a member's share account based on member's death, disability or layoff. Payment of share account benefits shall be by lump sum, which shall consist of the accumulated total of the member's share account or can be rolled over in accordance with Section 22-7 of the Internal Revenue Code, with an additional payment made for any amount credited in the year following the member's termination of employment. Any additional costs of additional minimum or mandated pension benefits required by changes to state law that take effect after the date of the ordinance from which this section derived shall be paid from the additional premium tax revenues before any remaining additional premium tax revenues are allocated to the share accounts hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 00-08, § 2, 7-17-2000; Ord. No. 00-12, § 2, 9-25-2000; Ord. No. 09-02, § 2, 2-17-2009; Ord. No. 11-01, § 5, 2-7-2011; Ord. No. 15-11 , § 2, 6-1-2015) 
Sec. 22-62. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each member may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death; and each designation may be revoked by such member by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. 
(b)  If a deceased member fails to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a) of this section, or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member predeceases the member, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the pension plan with respect to such deceased member, shall be paid to the estate of the member. 
(Ord. No. 00-08, § 2, 7-17-2000) 
Sec. 22-63. - Reports to division of retirement. 
    No later than March 15 each year, the chairman or secretary of the board shall file a report with the division of retirement in accordance with F.S. § 175.261(2). 
(Ord. No. 00-08, § 2, 7-17-2000) 
Sec. 22-64. - Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons receiving benefits under the provisions of this article, in which it shall be noted the time when the benefits commence and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the secretary shall keep a record of all members employed by the city in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment, and date such employment is terminated. 
(Ord. No. 00-08, § 2, 7-17-2000) 
Sec. 22-65. - Internal Revenue Code compliance. 
(a)  Maximum amount of retirement income . 
(1)  The limitations of this subsection (a) shall apply in limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, except as otherwise provided herein, and are intended to comply with the requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and shall be construed in accordance with said Act and guidance issued thereunder. The provisions of this subsection (a) shall supersede any provision of the plan to the extent such provision is inconsistent with this subsection. 
The annual pension as defined in paragraph (2) below otherwise payable to a member at any time shall not exceed the dollar limitation for the member multiplied by a fraction whose value cannot exceed one, the numerator of which is the member's number of years (or part thereof, but not less than one year) of service with the city and the denominator of which is ten. For this purpose, no more than one year of service may be credited for any plan year. If the benefit the member would otherwise accrue in a limitation year would produce an annual pension in excess of the dollar limitation, the benefit shall be limited (or the rate of accrual reduced) to a benefit that does not exceed the dollar limitation. 
(2)  "Annual pension" means the sum of all annual benefits, payable in the form of a straight life annuity. Benefits payable in any other form shall be adjusted to the larger of: 
a.  For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007: 
1.  The straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the member's form of benefit, or 
2.  The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
b.  For limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007: 
1.  The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan for the particular form of payment, or 
2.  The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this subsection (a), and the amount payable under the form of benefit in any limitation year shall not exceed the limits of this subsection (a) applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Section 415(d) of the [Internal Revenue] Code. For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form. 
(3)  "Dollar limitation" means, effective for the first limitation year beginning after January 1, 2001, $160,000.00, automatically adjusted under [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415(d), effective January 1 of each year, as published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, and payable in the form of a straight life annuity. The new limitation shall apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment, but a member's benefits shall not reflect the adjusted limit prior to January 1 of that calendar year. The dollar limitation shall be further adjusted based on the age of the member when the benefit begins as follows: 
a.  For annuity starting dates in limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007. 
1.  If the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is after age 65. 
(i)  If the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement. 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation with actuarial equivalence computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate assumption and the mortality basis prescribed in [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) for that annuity starting date (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
(ii)  If the plan does have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement. 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of (aa) the dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of this subsection (a), and (bb) the limitation determined under subparagraph (3)a.1.(i) of this subsection (a). For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the member, computed disregarding the member's accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 65 is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical member who is age 65 and has the same accrued benefit as the member. 
2.  Except with respect to a member who is a "Qualified Member" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, for benefits (except survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the [Internal Revenue] Code), if the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is before age 62. 
(i)  If the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement. 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation with actuarial equivalence computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate assumption and the mortality basis prescribed in [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) for that annuity starting date (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
(ii)  If the plan does have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement. 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of (aa) the dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of this subsection (a), and (bb) the limitation determined under subparagraph (3)a.2.(i) of this subsection (a). 
b.  For annuity starting dates in limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007: 
Age as of Annuity Starting Date: Adjustment of Dollar Limitation: Over 65 The smaller of: (a) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 65, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan, or (b) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 65, computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). Any increase in the dollar limitation determined in accordance with this paragraph shall not reflect a mortality decrement between age 65 and the age at which benefits commence if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken into account. 62 to 65 No adjustment. Less than 62 The smaller of: (a) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 62, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan, or (b) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 62, computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). This adjustment shall not apply to any "Qualified Member" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H), nor to survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the [Internal Revenue] Code.  
(4)  With respect to clause (3)a.1.(i), clause (3)a.2.(i) and paragraph (3)b. above, no adjustment shall be made to the dollar limitation to reflect the probability of a member's death between the annuity starting date and age 62, or between age 65 and the annuity starting date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member prior to the annuity starting date. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the annuity starting date, such an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the member's death if the plan does not charge members for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, as defined in [Internal Revenue] Code Section 417(c), upon the member's death. 
(5)  The term "limitation year" is the 12 month period which is used for application of the limitations under [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415 and shall be the calendar year. 
(6)  The limitations set forth in this subsection (a) shall not apply if the annual pension does not exceed $10,000.00 provided the member has never participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by the city. 
(7)  Cost-of-living adjustments in the dollar limitation for benefits shall be limited to scheduled annual increases determined by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 415(d) of the [Internal Revenue] Code. 
(8)  In the case of a member who has fewer than ten years of participation in the plan, the dollar limitation set forth in paragraph (3) of this subsection (a) shall be multiplied by a fraction - (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the plan, and (ii) the denominator of which is ten. 
(9)  Any portion of a member's benefit that is attributable to mandatory member contributions (unless picked-up by the city) or rollover contributions, shall be taken into account in the manner prescribed in the regulations under Section 415 of the [Internal Revenue] Code. 
(10)  Should any member participate in more than one defined benefit plan maintained by the city, in any case in which the member's benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the dollar limitation applicable at that age, the accrual of the member's benefit under this plan shall be reduced so that the member's combined benefits will equal the dollar limitation. 
(11)  For a member who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one annuity starting date, the annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to Section 1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d), and with regard to Section 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(12)  The determination of the annual pension under paragraph (a)(2) of this subsection (a) [sic] shall take into account (in the manner prescribed by the regulations under Section 415 of the [Internal Revenue] Code) Social Security supplements described in Section 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits pursuant [to] Section 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(13)  The above limitations are intended to comply with the provisions of Section 415 of the [Internal Revenue] Code, as amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the city shall be exactly equal to the maximum amounts allowed under Section 415 of the [Internal Revenue] Code and regulations thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this subsection (a) and the provisions of Section 415 of the [Internal Revenue] Code and regulations thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of Section 415 of the [Internal Revenue] Code. The value of any benefits forfeited as a result of the application of this subsection (a) shall be used to decrease future employer contributions. 
(14)  For the purpose of applying the limitations set forth in Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, compensation shall include any elective deferral (as defined in Code Section 402(g)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code), and any amount which is contributed or deferred by the employer at the election of the member and which is not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of Section 125 or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code. For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2001, for the purposes of applying the limitations described in this subsection (a), compensation paid or made available during such limitation years shall include elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of Section 132(f)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. For limitation years on or after July 1, 2007, compensation shall include payments that otherwise qualify as compensation and that are made by the later of: (a) two and one-half months after severance from employment with the employer, and (b) the end of the limitation year that includes the date of severance. With respect to plan years beginning on or after December 31, 2008, compensation shall also include differential wage payments within the meaning of Section 3401(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(b)  Required beginning date. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, payment of a participant's retirement benefits under the plan shall commence not later than the participant's required beginning date, which is defined as the later of: 
-April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant attains or will attain the age of 701/2 years; or 
-April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant retires. 
(c)  Required minimum distributions. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the participant no later than the participant's required beginning date as defined in subsection (b) of this section 22-65. 
(2)  Death of participant before distributions begin. 
a.  If the participant dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
1.  If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 701/2, if later. 
2.  If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
b.  The participant's entire interest shall be distributed as follows: 
1.  Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in subparagraph (2)a. above, over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding: 
(i)  Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the participant's death; or 
(ii)  If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
2.  No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
c.  Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. In any case in which (i) the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins, (ii) the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, and (iii) the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, subparagraphs (2)a. and (2)b. above shall apply as though the surviving spouse were the participant. 
(3)  Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during participant's lifetime. 
a.  Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the participant's spouse. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Treasury regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain. 
b.  Period-certain annuities. Unless the participant's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the participant reaches age 70, the applicable distribution period for the participant is the distribution period for age 70 under the uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of 70 over the age of the participant as of the participant's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the participant's spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this subparagraph (3)b., or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and the participant's spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with subparagraphs (4)a., (4)b. and (4)c. below. If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the participant's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
a.  General annuity requirements. If the participant's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
1.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year; 
2.  The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain, not longer than the distribution period described in paragraphs (2) or (3) above, whichever is applicable, of this subsection (c); 
3.  Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted; 
4.  Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows: 
(i)  By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
(ii)  To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period dies or is no longer the participant's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the [Internal Revenue] Code; 
(iii)  To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the participant's death; or 
(iv)  To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment. 
b.  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subparagraph (2)a.1. or (2)a.2., whichever is applicable) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required beginning date. 
c.  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the participant in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(5)  [Distributions.] For purposes of this subsection (c), distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the participant (or to the participant's surviving spouse) before the participant's required beginning date (or, if to the participant's surviving spouse, before the date distributions are required to begin in accordance with subparagraph (2)a. above), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(6)  Definitions. 
a.  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the [Internal Revenue] Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-4 of the Treasury regulations. 
b.  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to paragraph 2. of this subsection (c). 
c.  Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations. 
(d)  (1)  [Rollover distribution.] Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section: 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: 
1.  Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; 
2.  Any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the [Internal Revenue] Code; 
3.  The portion of any distribution which is made upon hardship of the member; and 
4.  The portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), provided that a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the [Internal Revenue] Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. 
(3)  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the [Internal Revenue] Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, or, with respect to distributions on or after January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA (subject to the limitations of [Internal Revenue] Code Section 408A(c)(3)) that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. 
(4)  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. Furthermore, effective January 1, 2007, a surviving designated beneficiary as defined in Section 401(a)(9)(E) of the [Internal Revenue] Code who is not the surviving spouse and who elects a direct rollover to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the [Internal Revenue] Code or an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the [Internal Revenue] Code shall be considered a distributee. 
(5)  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(e)  [Maximum amount of mandatory distribution.] Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the maximum amount of any mandatory distribution, as defined in Section 401(a)(31) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, payable under the plan shall be $1,000.00. 
(f)  Compensation limitations under 401(a)(17). In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, the annual compensation of each participant taken into account under the plan shall not exceed the EGTRRA annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning after December 31, 2001. The EGTRRA annual compensation limit is $200,000.00, as adjusted by the commissioner for increases in the cost of living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the [Internal Revenue] Code. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding 12 months, over which compensation is determined (determination period) beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. 
Any reference in the plan to the limitation under Section 401 (a)(17) of the [Internal Revenue] Code shall mean the EGTRRA annual compensation limit set forth in this provision. 
(g)  [Use of funds.] At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan with respect to members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit.

(1)  The attainment by the member of age 65; 
(2)  The tenth anniversary of the date on which the member commenced participation in the pension plan; or 
(3)  The termination of the member's service with the city. 
(b)  If the payment of a member's retirement income cannot begin on the date required under subsection (a) of this section because the board either cannot ascertain the amount of the member's retirement income or cannot locate the member after making reasonable efforts to do so, the payment of the member's benefits shall begin not later than 60 days after the date on which the amount can be ascertained or the member is located, whichever is applicable. Any such payment shall be made retroactive to a date which is not earlier than the date on which the payment of the member's benefits was scheduled to begin but which is not later than the date specified under subsection (a) of this section.

(2)  If the member's death occurs before the distribution of his interest in the pension plan has commenced, the member's entire interest in the pension plan shall be distributed within five years of the member's death, unless it is to be distributed in accordance with the following rules: 
a.  The member's remaining interest in the pension plan is payable to his spouse, issue or dependent; 
b.  The remaining interest is to be distributed over the life of the spouse, issue or dependent or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the spouse, issue or dependent; and 
c.  Such distribution begins within one year of the member's death unless the member's spouse, issue or dependent shall receive the remaining interest, in which case the distribution need not begin before the date on which the member would have attained age 701/2, and if the spouse, issue or dependent dies before the distribution to the spouse, issue or dependent begins, this section shall be applied as if the spouse, issue or dependent were the member.

(b)  If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the pension plan are discontinued, the board shall continue to administer the pension plan in accordance with the provisions of this article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, or if contributions to the pension plan are discontinued, there shall be full vesting (100 percent) of benefits accrued to the date of repeal. The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city, or then current plan sponsor, if additional assets are required, in which event the city, or then current plan sponsor, shall continue to financially support the pension plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(c)  The board of trustees shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, that is, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each firefighter entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection F.S. § 175.361(3).

DIVISION 1. - ADMINISTRATION 

Sec. 26-31. - General. 
(a)  Title. These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of the City of Marco Island, hereinafter referred to as "this ordinance." 
(b)  Scope. The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including, but not limited to, the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(c)  Intent. The purposes of this ordinance and the flood load and flood-resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
(d)  Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This ordinance is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
(e)  Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this ordinance. 
(f)  Disclaimer of liability. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the Marco Island City Council, the City of Marco Island, by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
( Ord. No. 12-05, § 2(101), 6-18-2012 ) 
Sec. 26-32. - Applicability. 
(a)  General. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable. 
(b)  Areas to which this ordinance applies. This ordinance shall apply to all flood hazard areas within the City of Marco Island, as established in subsection 26-32(c) of this ordinance. 
(c)  Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. The flood insurance study for Collier County, Florida, and incorporated areas dated May 16, 2012, and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this ordinance and shall serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that establish flood hazard areas are on file at the Community Affairs Department/City of Marco Island, 50 Bald Eagle Drive, Marco Island FL, 34145. 
(1)  Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas. To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to section 26-35 of this ordinance, the floodplain administrator may require submission of additional data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the community indicates that ground elevations: 
a.  Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this ordinance and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
b.  Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 
(d)  Other laws. The provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law. 
(e)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This ordinance supersedes any ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances, including, but not limited to, land development regulations, zoning ordinances, or stormwater management regulations. In the event of a conflict between this ordinance and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern. This ordinance shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject to such interests shall also be governed by this ordinance. 
(f)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this ordinance, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

(c)  Limitations on authority to grant variances. The Marco Island City Council shall base its decisions on variances on technical justifications submitted by applicants, the considerations for issuance in subsection 26-37(f) of this ordinance, the conditions of issuance set forth in section 26-37(g) of this ordinance, and the comments and recommendations of the floodplain administrator and the building official. The Marco Island City Council has the right to attach such conditions as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this ordinance. 
(1)  Restrictions in floodways. A variance shall not be issued for any proposed development in a floodway if any increase in base flood elevations would result, as evidenced by the applicable analyses and certifications required in subsection 26-35(c) of this ordinance. 
(d)  Historic buildings. A variance is authorized to be issued for the repair, improvement, or rehabilitation of a historic building that is determined eligible for the exception to the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code, Existing Building, Chapter 11 Historic Buildings, upon a determination that the proposed repair, improvement, or rehabilitation will not preclude the building's continued designation as a historic building and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the building. If the proposed work precludes the building's continued designation as a historic building, a variance shall not be granted and the building and any repair, improvement, and rehabilitation shall be subject to the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
(e)  Functionally dependent uses. A variance is authorized to be issued for the construction or substantial improvement necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, as defined in this ordinance, provided the variance meets the requirements of subsection 26-37(c)(1), is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, and all due consideration has been given to use of methods and materials that minimize flood damage during occurrence of the base flood. 
(f)  Considerations for issuance of variances. In reviewing requests for variances, the Marco Island City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all other applicable provisions of the Florida Building Code, this ordinance, and the following: 
(1)  The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or damage; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

(5)  The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development that are subject to lower risk of flooding or erosion; 
(6)  The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
(7)  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
(8)  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(9)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
(g)  Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
(1)  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this ordinance or the required elevation standards; 
(2)  Determination by the Marco Island City Council that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property. 
( Ord. No. 12-05, § 2(107), 6-18-2012 ) 
Sec. 26-38. - Violations. 
(a)  Violations. Any development that is not within the scope of the Florida Building Code but that is regulated by this ordinance that is performed without an issued permit, that is in conflict with an issued permit, or that does not fully comply with this ordinance, shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance. A building or structure without the documentation of elevation of the lowest floor, other required design certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance or the Florida Building Code is presumed to be a violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
(b)  Authority.

In coastal high hazard areas, development activities other than buildings and structures shall be permitted only if also authorized by the appropriate state or local authority; if located outside the footprint of, and not structurally attached to, buildings and structures; and if analyses prepared by qualified registered design professionals demonstrate no harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave run-up and wave reflection that would increase damage to adjacent buildings and structures. Such other development activities include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Bulkheads, seawalls, retaining walls, revetments, and similar erosion control structures; 
(2)  Solid fences and privacy walls, and fences prone to trapping debris, unless designed and constructed to fail under flood conditions less than the design flood or otherwise function to avoid obstruction of floodwaters; and 
(3)  On-site sewage treatment and disposal systems defined in 64E-6.002, F.A.C., as filled systems or mound systems. 
(h)  Nonstructural fill in coastal high hazard areas (zone V). In coastal high hazard areas: 
(1)  Minor grading and the placement of minor quantities of nonstructural fill shall be permitted for landscaping and for drainage purposes under and around buildings. 
(2)  Nonstructural fill with finished slopes that are steeper than one unit vertical to five units horizontal shall be permitted only if an analysis prepared by a qualified registered design professional demonstrates no harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave run-up and wave reflection that would increase damage to adjacent elevated buildings and structures. 
(3)  Where authorized by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection or applicable local approval, sand dune construction and restoration of sand dunes under or around elevated buildings are permitted without additional engineering analysis or certification of the diversion of floodwater or wave run-up and wave reflection if the scale and location of the dune work is consistent with local beach-dune morphology and the vertical clearance is maintained between the top of the sand dune and the lowest horizontal structural member of the building.

Sec. 26-131. - Fiscal impact statement. 
    In terms of design, plan application review, construction and inspection of buildings and structures, the cost impact as an overall average is negligible in regard to the local technical amendments because all development has been subject to the requirements of the local floodplain management ordinance adopted for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. In terms of lower potential for flood damage, there will be continued savings and benefits to consumers.

Sec. 26-132. - Applicability. 
    For the purposes of jurisdictional applicability, this ordinance shall apply in the City of Marco Island. This ordinance shall apply to all applications for development, including building permit applications and subdivision proposals, submitted on or after May 16, 2012.

(Ord. No. 02-04, § 1, 1-7-2002) 
Sec. 30-2. - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the purpose of the city council to establish the standards, regulations and procedures for review and approval of all proposed development of property within the city, and to provide a development review process that will be comprehensive, consistent, and efficient in the implementation of the goals, objectives, and policies of the city comprehensive plan. 
    In order to foster and preserve public health, safety, and welfare, and to aid in the harmonious, orderly, and progressive development of the city, it is the intent of Ordinance No. 02-04 that the development process in the city be efficient, effective, and equitable, in terms of consistency with established regulations and procedures, respect for the rights of property owners, and consideration of the interests of the citizens of the city. 
    The city council deems it to be in the best public interest for all property and development to be conceived, designed, built, and used in accordance with good planning and design practices and the minimum standards set forth in this code. 
(Ord. No. 02-04, § 2, 1-7-2002) 
Sec. 30-3. - Applicability. 
    The provisions of this code shall apply to all land, property and development within the corporate limits of the city. No development shall be undertaken without prior authorization pursuant to this code. Specifically, no building, structure, land or water shall hereafter be developed, or occupied, and no building, structure, or part thereof shall be erected, reconstructed, moved, located, or structurally altered except in conformity with the regulations set forth herein and for the zoning district in which it is located. 
(1)  Relationship to comprehensive plan. The adoption of this article is consistent with, compatible with and furthers the goals, policies, objectives, land uses, and densities or intensities contained and required in the city comprehensive plan, and it implements and directly advances the goals, policies and objectives of the such comprehensive plan. The city council hereby declares and affirmatively states that in the event that any land development regulation, this code, or any provision hereof or amendment hereto is not consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan, as amended, the provisions of the comprehensive plan, as amended, shall govern any action taken with regard to an application for a development order or other activity. Furthermore, any land development regulation, this code, or any provision hereof or amendment hereto shall be interpreted, construed and implemented in such a manner which will make it most consistent with the city comprehensive plan, as amended. 
(2)  Exceptions. 
a.  Previously issued building permits. The provisions of this article and any amendments hereto shall not affect the validity of any lawfully issued and effective building permit issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived if: 
1.  The development activity authorized by the permit has commenced prior to the effective date of this code or any amendment hereto, or will commence after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived but prior to the permit's expiration or termination; and 
2.  The development activity continues without interruption in good faith until development is complete. If the building permit expires, any further development shall be in conformance with the requirements of this article or any amendment hereto. 
b.  Time limits on previously approved development orders. Any time limits on any development order approved prior to the adoption of this article shall continue to run and shall not be enlarged, expanded or stayed by the adoption of this article. Furthermore, any time limits required under this article for any types of development orders which are more restrictive or shorter that the time limits remaining on previously approved development orders shall apply retroactively to all such previously approved development orders. However, the application of such more restrictive time limits under this article to previously approved development orders shall commence to run on the effective date of this code. 
(Ord. No. 02-04, § 3, 1-7-2002) 
Sec. 30-4. - Interpretations. 
(a)  Authority. The community development director shall have the authority to make all interpretations of the text of this code, the boundaries of zoning districts on the official zoning atlas, and to make all interpretations of the text of the comprehensive plan and the boundaries of land use districts on the future land use map. 
    The chief building official shall have the authority to make all interpretations of the text of this code on matters related to the building code, building permit requirements, building construction administrative code or building permits. 
    In cases where interpretations of both the chief building official and community development director are requested jointly, any conflict shall be resolved by the community development director. 
(b)  Initiation. An interpretation may be requested by any affected person, resident, developer, land owner, government agency or department, or any person having a contractual interest in land in the city. 
(c)  Procedures. 
(1)  Submission of request for interpretation. Before an interpretation shall be provided, a written request shall be submitted to the community development director, or chief building official, whichever is applicable, in a form established by him. A fee for the request and processing of the request shall be established at a rate set by the city council from time to time and shall be charged to and paid by the applicant. 
(2)  Determination of completeness. After a request for interpretation has been received, the community development director or the chief building official whichever is applicable, shall determine whether the request is complete. If the community development director or chief building official, whichever is applicable, determines that the request is not complete, he shall serve a written notice on the applicant specifying the deficiencies. The community development director or chief building official, whichever is applicable, shall take no further action on the request for interpretation until the deficiencies are remedied. 
(3)  Notification of affected property owner. Where a site specific interpretation has been requested by a party other than the affected property owner, the city shall notify the property owner that an interpretation has been requested concerning their property. 
(d)  Rendering of interpretation. After the request for interpretation has been determined complete, the community development director or chief building official, shall review and evaluate the request in light of the comprehensive plan, the future land use map, the code and/or the official zoning atlas, and building code related matters, whichever is applicable, and render an interpretation. The community development director and the chief building official may consult with the city attorney and other city departments before rendering an interpretation. Prior to the release to the applicant of any interpretation, such proposed interpretation shall be reviewed by the city attorney for legal form and sufficiency. Interpretations made pursuant to this section shall be rendered within 45 days of issuance of a determination of completeness. 
(e)  Form. The interpretation shall be in writing and shall be sent to the applicant by certified mail return receipt requested. 
(f)  Official record. The community development director shall maintain an official record of all interpretations rendered by either the community development director or chief building official, which shall be available for public inspection during normal business hours. 
(1)  Notice of interpretation. The community development director shall provide public notification upon the issuance of an interpretation. For general interpretations of the building code, the comprehensive plan or land development code, notice of the interpretation and appeal time-frame shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. For interpretations affecting a specific parcel of land, notice of the interpretation and appeal time-frame shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation, and mail notice of the interpretation shall be sent to all property owners within 300 feet of the property lines of the land for which the interpretation is effective. 
(2)  Effective time limits of an interpretation. An interpretation rendered by the community development director or the chief building official, as the case may be, shall remain in effect until the appropriate code section is amended to clarify the applicable provision or provisions which warranted the interpretation, or until such time as the interpretation is adopted, modified, or rejected as a result of an appeal to the board of zoning appeals and/or the building board of adjustments and appeals, by the applicant or other individual or entity. From the time the interpretation is rendered and the time the appropriate code section is amended, or in the case of an appeal, until such time as the board of zoning appeals and/or building board of adjustments and appeals has rendered its finding, no further request for interpretation regarding the same issue shall be permitted. 
(3)  Interpretations rendered by either the community development director or the chief building official are not final until the appeal period expires or the appeal, if filed, as concluded. 
(g)  Appeal to board of zoning appeals or construction board of adjustments and appeals. Within 30 days after receipt by the applicant or affected property owner of a written interpretation sent by certified mail return receipt requested by the community development director or chief building official, or within 30 days of publication of public notice of interpretation, the applicant, affected property owner, or aggrieved or adversely affected party may appeal the interpretation to the construction board of adjustments and appeals for matters relating to building and technical codes, or to the board of zoning appeals for all other matters in this code. For the purposes of this section, an affected property owner is defined as an owner of property located within 300 feet of the property lines of the land for which the interpretation is effective. An aggrieved or affected party is defined as any person or group of persons which will suffer an adverse effect to an interest protected or furthered by the city comprehensive plan, land development code, or building code(s). The alleged adverse interest may be shared in common with other members of the community at large, but shall exceed in degree the general interest in community good shared by all persons. 
    A request for appeal shall be filed in writing. Such request shall state the basis for the appeal and shall include any pertinent information, exhibits and other backup information in support of the appeal. A fee for the application and processing of an appeal shall be established at a rate set by the city council from time to time and shall be charged to and paid by the applicant. The board of zoning appeals or the construction board of adjustments and appeals, whichever is applicable, shall hold an advertised public hearing on the appeal and shall consider the interpretation of the community development director or chief building official, whichever is applicable, and public testimony in light of the comprehensive plan, the future land use map, the code or the official zoning atlas, or building code related matters, whichever is applicable. The board of zoning appeals or the building board of adjustments and appeals, whichever is applicable, shall adopt the community development director's or chief building official's interpretation, whichever is applicable, with or without modifications or conditions, or reject his interpretation. The board of zoning appeals or the building board of adjustments and appeals, whichever is applicable, shall not be authorized to modify or reject the community development director's or chief building official's interpretation unless such board finds that the determination is not supported by substantial competent evidence or that the interpretation is contrary to the comprehensive plan, the future land use map, the code or the official zoning atlas, or building code, whichever is applicable. 
(h)  Rules for interpretation of boundaries. Interpretations regarding boundaries of land use districts on the future land use map or boundaries of zoning districts on the official zoning atlas shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(1)  District regulations extend to all portions of districts surrounded by boundaries. Except as otherwise specifically provided, a district symbol or name shown within district boundaries on the future land use map or the official zoning atlas indicates that district regulations pertaining to the district extend throughout the whole area surrounded by the boundary line. 
(2)  Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of land use districts as shown on the future land use map or boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the official zoning atlas, the following rules shall apply: 
a.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of dedicated streets, highways, alleys, or rights-of-way shall be construed as following such centerline as they exist on the ground, except where variation of actual location from mapped location would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel, in which case the boundary shall be interpreted in such a manner as to avoid changing the zoning status of any lot or parcel. In case of a street vacation, the boundary shall be construed as remaining in its location except where ownership of the vacated street is divided other than at the center, in which case the boundary shall be construed as moving with the ownership. 
b.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines, public property lines, and the like shall be construed as following such lines; provided however, that where such boundaries are adjacent to a dedicated street, alley, highway, or right-of-way and the zoning status of the street, highway, alley, or right-of-way and the zoning status of the street, highway, alley, or right-of-way [sic] is not indicated, the boundaries shall be construed as running to the middle of the street, highway, alley, right-of-way. 
c.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following city or county limits shall be construed as following such city or county limits. 
d.  Boundaries indicated as following mean high-water lines or centerlines or [of] streams, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed as following such mean high-water lines or centerlines. In case of a change in mean high-water line, or of the course or extent of bodies of water, the boundaries shall be construed as moving with the change, except where such moving would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel; and in such case the boundary shall be interpreted in such a manner as to avoid changing the zoning status of any lot or parcel. 
e.  Boundaries indicated as entering any body of water but not continuing to intersect with other zoning boundaries or with the limits of jurisdiction of the city shall be construed as extending in the direction in which they enter the body of water to intersection with other zoning boundaries or with the limits of city jurisdiction. 
f.  Boundaries indicated as following physical features other than those listed above shall be construed as following such physical features, except where variation of actual location from mapped location would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel, and in such manner as to avoid changing the zoning status of any lot or parcel. 
g.  Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning atlas shall be determined by the scale of the map on the page of the atlas showing the property in question. 
(i)  Cases not covered above. In cases not covered above, or where the property or street layout existing on the ground is at variance with that shown on the official zoning atlas, the interpretation of the future land use map or the official zoning atlas shall be in accordance with the purpose and intent of the comprehensive plan and this code. 
(j)  Division of a lot of record by a boundary. Where a district boundary divides a lot of record at the time the boundary was established, and where the division makes impractical the reasonable use of the lot, the extension of the regulations for the front lot may be permitted as a conditional use for not to exceed 50 feet beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot. 
(k)  Continuity of zoning. In the event any unincorporated territory within Collier County shall seek annexation and hereafter become incorporated within the city, to insure that there shall be no lapse of zoning, then, any and all zoning regulations which may be in effect in such territory shall remain in full force and effect and shall continue to be administered and enforced by the city under this code until such time as municipal zoning within such territory shall be adopted and take effect. 
(Ord. No. 02-04, § 4, 1-7-2002) 
Sec. 30-5. - Vested rights. 
(a)  Administrative process. An applicant claiming that certain property rights have been vested prior to the effective date of these regulations will be provided an administrative process that will ensure adequate procedural due process including notice, public hearing, and the right to present and rebut evidence. The city council, acting as the board of zoning appeals (hereinafter BZA), subject to the procedures in this division shall issue formal findings of fact, conclusions of law, a finding of consistency or inconsistency with the comprehensive plan and the code and a determination of vested rights. The claim shall be administered as provided in this division. 
(b)  Application. An application for determination of vested rights shall be submitted in the form established by the community development director. An application for determination of vested rights shall be filed, if at all, within one year of the effective date of this code. Failure to file such application for a property within the one-year period shall forever waive and bar all claims for vested rights or equitable estoppel for such property, it being the express intent of the city that such development rights be "amortized" over the one-year period, plus if applicable, the additional two-year limitation period established herein. An application fee in an amount to be determined by the city council shall accompany and be part of the application. The application shall, at a minimum, include: 
(1)  Name, address, and telephone number of the owner and authorized applicant if other than the owner; 
(2)  Street address, legal description, and acreage of the property; and 
(3)  All factual information and knowledge reasonably available to the owner and applicant to address the criteria established in this code. 
(c)  Determination of completeness. The community development director shall determine whether the application submitted is complete. If he determines that the application is not complete, the community development director shall notify the applicant in writing of the deficiencies. The community development director shall take no further steps to process the application until the deficiencies have been remedied. 
(d)  Review and determination or recommendation by the community development director and city attorney. After receipt of an application for determination of vested rights, the community development director and the city attorney shall review and evaluate the application in light of all of the criteria contained herein. Based on the review and evaluation, the community development director shall prepare a written recommendation to the BZA that the application should be denied, granted or granted with conditions. Such recommendation shall include findings of fact for each of the criteria established in this section to the extent that information is presented or obtained or inclusion is feasible or applicable. 
(e)  Review and determination of vested rights determination by the board of zoning appeals. Upon receipt by the BZA of the application for determination of vested rights and the written recommendation of the community development director, the BZA shall hold a public hearing on the application. At this hearing, the BZA shall take evidence and sworn testimony in regard to the criteria set forth in this section, and shall follow their rules of procedures, empowered to swear witnesses and take testimony under oath. Testimony shall be limited to the matters directly relating to the criteria and standards set forth in this section. The community development director shall represent the city, shall attend the public hearing, and shall offer such evidence as is relevant to the proceedings. The owner of the property and its authorized agents, may offer such evidence at the public hearing as is relevant to the proceedings and criteria. The order of presentation before the board of zoning appeals at the public hearing shall be as follows: (1) the city's summary of the application, written recommendation, witnesses and other evidence; (2) owner or applicant witnesses and evidence; (3) public witnesses and evidence; and (4) city rebuttal, if any. 
(f)  Issuance of vested rights determination by the board of zoning appeals. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the BZA shall consider the application for determination of vested rights, the recommendation of the community development director, and the evidence and testimony presented at the public hearing, in light of all of the criteria set forth in this section, and shall deny, grant, or grant with conditions the application for determination of vested rights for the property or properties at issue. The determination shall be in entered into the public record and shall include findings of fact for each of the applicable criteria, conclusions of law for each of such criteria, and a determination denying, granting, or granting with conditions, in whole or in part, the vested rights. 
    Within seven days of the public hearing, the community development director shall advise the applicant in writing, return receipt required, of the action taken by the board of zoning appeals. 
(g)  Appeal to circuit court. Within 30 days after issuance of the board of zoning appeals determination of vested rights, the owner or its authorized attorney or agent, may appeal the determination of vested rights by the board of zoning appeals to circuit court. 
(h)  Criteria for vested rights. This section is intended to strictly adhere to and implement existing Florida case law and statutory law as they relate to the doctrine of vested rights and equitable estoppel as applied to a local government exercising its authority and powers in zoning, the provision of adequate public facilities concurrent with development regulations, and related matters. It is the express intent of the city to require application of the provisions of this code to as much development and property as is legally possible without violating the legally vested rights which the owner may have obtained in accordance with Florida common law and statutory law, including F.S. § 163.3167(8). The criteria herein provided shall be considered in rendering a vested rights determination under this division. It is intended that each case be decided on a case-by-case factual analysis. An owner shall be entitled to a positive determination of vested rights only if he demonstrates by substantial competent evidence that he is entitled to complete his development without regard to the otherwise applicable provisions of this code based on the provisions of F.S. § 163.3167(8), or all three of the following requirements of the three-part test under Florida case law: (1) Upon some act or omission of the city, (2) a property owner relying in good faith, (3) has made such a substantial change in position or has incurred such extensive obligations and expenses that it would be highly inequitable and unjust to destroy the rights acquired. 
(i)  Limitation of determination of vested rights. A determination of vested rights which grants an application for determination of vested rights shall expire and be null and void unless either (1) construction is commenced pursuant to a final development order, final subdivision plat, or final site development plan, within two years after the issuance of the determination of the vested rights under this division, or (2) where substantial permanent buildings have been, or are being constructed or installed pursuant to a valid, unexpired, final development order, final subdivision plat, or final site development plan, shall continue in good faith until project completion. Failure to obtain a building permit within two years after the issuance of the determination of vested rights under this code shall rendered said vested rights to expire and become null and void. The aforementioned two-year time limitation on the determination of vested rights shall be stayed during any time periods within which commencement of construction pursuant to a final development order, final subdivision plat, or final site development plan is prohibited or deferred by the city solely as a result of lack of adequate public facilities to serve the property, pursuant to this code. 
(j)  Public notice. For purposes of this section due public notice shall mean at least 15 days' notice of the time, place and subject of such hearing published one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the area. Notice of the submission of an application for vested rights determination and, when applicable, of public hearings held pursuant to this division shall be prominently posted by the applicant on the property for which the vested rights determination is sought and shall be sent at the applicant's expense to property owners within 300 feet of the property lines of the subject property within 15 days of the date of receipt by the city of a completed application. Said notice shall briefly state the time and place of the hearing, the nature of the matter to be discussed and that written comments may be filed with the community development director. 
(k)  Public participation. Affected parties may submit written comments and pertinent factual information and data to the community development director. Such written comments and pertinent factual information and data may be submitted up to five days prior to the date set for the public hearing. 
(Ord. No. 02-04, § 5, 1-7-2002) 
Sec. 30-6. - Nonconformities. 
(a)  Generally. Within the zoning districts established by the land development code or amendments that may later be adopted, there may exist lots, structures, uses of land, water and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this code was adopted or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this code or future amendments. It is the intent of this division to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are voluntarily renovated or removed as required by this code, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of the land development code that the nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, intensified, or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
(b)  Declaration. Nonconforming uses are declared by this division to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land or water, or a nonconforming use of structure, land or water in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after the effective date of this code or relevant amendment thereto by attachment on a structure or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved, except as provided for herein. 
(c)  Vested projects. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this code shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of a building or property on which a building permit had been applied for prior to the effective date of adoption of relevant amendment of this code. 
    In addition, nothing in this code shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any property for which a development plan was lawfully required and approved prior to the effective date of adoption of relevant amendment of this code, provided that such plan shall expire two years from the date of said approval, or one year from the date of adoption of this code, whichever shall first occur, if no actual construction has been commenced; and thereafter, all development shall be in accordance with the zoning regulations then in effect. Any such approved plat or plan may be amended by approval of the city council, provided the degree of nonconformity with this code shall not be increased. 
(d)  Nonconforming lots of record. In any district, any permitted or permissible structure may be erected, expanded, or altered on any lot of record at the effective date of adoption or relevant amendment to this code. 
The minimum size yard requirements in any commercial district shall be equal to the height of the proposed principal structure, or the minimum side yard requirement in the district, whichever is lesser. 
(e)  Nonconforming uses of lands or waters or structures only. Where, at the effective date of adoption or relevant amendment of this code, lawful use of lands or waters exists which would not be permitted under this code, the use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided: 
(1)  Enlargement, increase, intensification, alteration. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, intensified, increased, or extended to occupy a greater area of land, structure, or water than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or relevant amendment of this land development code, except a single-family, duplex, or mobile home use as provided for below. 
(2)  Movement. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or relevant amendment of this land development code. 
(3)  Discontinuance. If any such nonconforming use ceases for any reason (except where governmental action impedes access to the premises) for a period of more than 180 consecutive days, any subsequent use of land shall conform to the regulations specified by this code for the district in which such land is located. 
Notwithstanding the above definitions of discontinuance relative to a nonconforming use of land or water or structure, where the use of land, water or a structure has ceased for a period of more than 90 consecutive days, and where such property or use is deficient in the required amount of paved, striped parking, including parking and access to the structure for the disabled; water management facilities; landscaping; and other site improvements as required by this code, prior to the recommencement of any use of land, water or structure, said deficiencies as may apply shall be remedied, to the greatest extent possible given the physical constraints on the property, via the appropriate administrative processes, or as otherwise required by this code. 
(4)  Subdivision or structural additions. No land in nonconforming use shall be subdivided, nor shall any structures be added on such land except for the purposes and in a manner conforming to the regulations for the district in which such land is located; provided, however, that subdivision may be made which does not increase the degree of nonconformity of the use. 
(5)  Nonconformities not involving the use of a principal structure. Nonconformities not involving the use of a principal structure, including, but not limited to, open storage, building supplies, vehicles, mobile homes, trailers, equipment and machinery storage, and the like, shall be discontinued within one year of the effective date of this code or relevant amendment of this code. 
(f)  Extension of use in building manifestly designed for such use. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the effective date of adoption or relevant amendment of this code. Any nonconforming use which occupied a portion of a building not originally designed or intended for such use shall not be extended to any other part of the building. No nonconforming use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the building, nor any additional building on the same lot or parcel, not used for such nonconforming use at the effective date of adoption or relevant amendment of this code. 
(g)  Change in tenancy or ownership. There may be a change in tenancy, ownership, or management of a nonconforming use provided there is no change in the nature or character of such nonconforming use. 
(h)  Change in use. If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or of a structure and premises in combination may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same character, or to a more restricted nonconforming use, provided the board of zoning appeals, upon application to the community development director, shall find after public notice and hearing that the proposed use is equally or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use and that the relation of the structure to surrounding properties is such that adverse effect or occupants and neighboring properties will not be greater than if the existing nonconforming use is continued. In permitting such change, the board of zoning appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the intent and purpose of this code. 
(i)  Casual, temporary, or illegal use. The casual, temporary, or illegal use of land or structures, or land and structures in combination, shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use or to create rights in the continuance of such use. 
(j)  Uses under conditional use provisions not nonconforming uses. All uses lawfully existing on the effective date of this code which are permitted as a conditional use in a district under the terms of this code shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall without further action be deemed to have a conditional use permit. 
(k)  Change to conforming use requires future conformity with district regulations. Where a structure, or structure and premises in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is replaced by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which the structure is located, and the nonconforming use shall not thereafter be resumed nor shall any other nonconforming use be permitted. 
(l)  Nonconforming structures. Where a structure lawfully exists at the effective date of the adoption of this article or relevant amendment that could not be build under this code by reason of restrictions on lot area, lot coverage, height, yards, location on the lot, or requirements other than use concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity; provided, however, that the alteration, expansion, or replacement of nonconforming single-family dwellings, duplexes or mobile homes shall be permitted in accordance with this code. 
(2)  Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its actual replacement cost at time of destruction, as determined by a cost estimate submitted to the community development director, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with provisions of this zoning code or the city's post-disaster redevelopment ordinance (Ordinance No. 01-24). 
(3)  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, other than as a result of governmental action, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(4)  Nonconforming residential structures, which for the purpose of this section shall mean detached single-family dwellings duplexes or mobile homes in existence at the effective date of this zoning code or its relevant amendment and in continuous residential use thereafter, may be altered, expanded, or replaced upon recommendation of the city planning board and approval of the board of zoning appeals by resolution. 
(5)  Not withstanding the foregoing restrictions as to reconstruction, any residential structure or structures in any residential zone district may be rebuilt after destruction to the prior extent height and density of units per acre regardless of the percentage of destruction, subject to compliance with the applicable building code requirements in effect at the time of redevelopment. In the event of such rebuilding, all setbacks and other applicable district requirements shall be met unless a variance there for is obtained from the board of zoning appeals. For the purpose of this division, a hotel, motel, or boatel shall be considered to be a residential structure. 
(6)  Since the size and nature of the alteration, expansion or replacement of such nonconforming structures may vary widely, a site plan, and if applicable, preliminary building plans indicating the proposed alteration, expansion or replacement shall be presented with each petition. Prior to granting such alteration, expansion or replacement of a nonconforming single-family dwelling, duplex or mobile home, the planning board and the city council shall consider and base its approval on the following standards and criteria: 
a.  The alteration, expansion or replacement will not increase the density of the parcel or lot on which the nonconforming single-family dwelling, duplex or mobile homes located; 
b.  The alteration, expansion or replacement will not exceed the building height requirements of the district most closely associated with the subject nonconforming use; 
c.  The alteration, expansion or replacement will not further encroach upon any nonconforming setback; 
d.  The alteration, expansion or replacement will not decrease or further decrease the existing parking areas for the structure; 
e.  The alteration, expansion or replacement will not damage the character or quality of the neighborhood in which it is located or hinder the proper future development of the surrounding properties; and 
f.  Such alteration, expansion or replacement will not present a threat to the health, safety or welfare of the community or its resident. 
(m)  Replacement of mobile homes. Prior to issuance of any building permit for replacement of a mobile home, the property owner or authorized agent shall provide the community development director, or his designee, with three copies of a scaled drawing of the subject parcel which indicates: 
(1)  Proof of building permit issuance for structure being replaced. 
(2)  The location of the structure to be replaced and its relationship to adjacent mobile homes and parcel boundaries. 
(3)  Further, mobile homes located in either the C-4 or C-5 zoning district shall comply with replacement criteria contained in the land development code. 
(n)  Destruction of major structure or structures. When nonconforming use status applies to a major structure or structures, or to a major structure or structures and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure or structures shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. "Destruction" of the structure for purposes of this subsection is hereby defined as damage to the extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost at the time of the destruction. Upon removal or destruction as set out in this section, the use of land and structures shall therefore conform to the regulations for the district in which such land is located. 
(o)  Repairs and maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure and on any structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing to an extent not exceeding 20 percent of the current assessed valuation of the structure (or of the nonconforming portion of the structure if a nonconforming portion of a structure is involved), provided that the cubic content of the structure existing at the date it becomes nonconforming shall not be increased except subject further to the exception provided herein. 
(p)  Nonconforming structures unsafe because of lack of maintenance. If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure, or any structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs or maintenance, and is declared by the duly authorized official of the city to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(q)  Nonconforming structures unsafe for reasons other than lack of maintenance. If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure, or any structure containing a nonconforming use, becomes physically unsafe or unlawful for reasons other this lack of repairs or maintenance, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of such building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by the authorized official of the city charged with the public safety; provided, however, that where such unsafe condition(s) or unlawfulness is the result of damage from destruction, the percentage of damage limitations set out above, as the case may be, shall apply.

These notices are provided as a courtesy to certain persons that may be affected by a development permit application for the purpose of notifying those persons of the application and their ability to review submitted information and participate in public hearings. The failure of a property owner to receive a courtesy notice shall not be deemed as a failure to furnish or receive legally required written notice pursuant to this LDC. The failure of the applicant to send a courtesy notice shall be deemed as a failure to furnish legally required written notice pursuant to this LDC. 
b.  The cost of providing the courtesy notice as required by this LDC shall be the sole responsibility of the development permit applicant or said applicant's designated agent. Failure to comply with the provisions of this section in a timely manner may result in a postponement of the scheduled hearing until the notice is complete, or imposition by the department that a re-notice by the applicant must be accomplished at the applicant's sole expense. 
c.  A courtesy notice shall be mailed to all real property owners of real property any part of which is located within 300 feet of the real property subject to a development permit application. The 300-foot radius shall be measured in a straight line in all directions from the outermost boundary of the real property subject to a development permit application to any real property any part of which is within the 300-foot radius. Real property owners to whom a courtesy notice shall be given by mail shall be the real property owners of record as shown in the records of the county property appraiser at the time of mailing of the notice. The failure of a property owner to receive a courtesy notice shall not be deemed as a failure to receive legally required written notice pursuant to this LDC subsection. The mailed notice shall be sent by first class U.S. certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, by the applicant. Notice need not be given to the trustees of the internal improvement fund as the owners of submerged bottoms of real property.

(g)  Reserved. 
(h)  Limitations on the rezoning of property. 
(1)  No change in the zoning classification of property shall be considered which involves less than 43,560 square feet of area and 200 feet of street frontage except: where the proposal for rezoning of property involves an extension of an existing or similar adjacent district boundary; within the broader land use classification of "C" districts, "RSF" districts, "RMF" districts, wherein such rezone is compatible with, or provides appropriate transition from, adjacent districts of higher density or intensity; or a rezoning to planned unit development (PUD). The minimum acreages for rezoning of property to PUD are found in the PUD section of the LDC. However, the requirement of 200 feet of street frontage shall not apply to rezone petitions that provide 80 percent or more affordable housing units. 
(2)  Whenever the city council has denied an application for the rezoning of property, the planning board shall not thereafter: 
a.  Consider any further application for the same rezoning of any part or all of the same property for a period of 365 days from the date of rendition of such denial; 
b.  Consider an application for any other kind of rezoning of any part or all of the same property for a period of 180 days from the date of such action. 
(3)  Except as otherwise provided within this section, all rezoning approvals for which a final development order, such as a building permit or similar type of development order, has not been granted within the 1,826 days of the date of rendition of a rezoning approval shall be evaluated to determine if the zoning classification for the property should be changed to a lower, or other more suitable classification. Yearly the director shall prepare a report to the city council on the status of rezoned property advising the city council whether there are any properties that are subject to this provision. The purpose of the report will be to evaluate what procedural steps have been taken to develop affected real property under its current zoning classification. 
a.  With regard to real property subject to this subparagraph c., should the director determine that development has commenced, then the land shall retain its existing zoning classification and shall not be subject to additional review and classification change which would deprive the property owner or developer of a vested right to develop. 
b.  With regard to real property subject to this subparagraph c., should the director determine that development has not commenced, and then upon review and consideration of the report and any supplemental information that may be provided, the city council shall elect one of the following: 
1.  To take no action with regard to the current zoning classification on the property for a maximum period of another 1,826 days; at the end of which time, the property shall again be evaluated under the procedures as defined herein; or 
2.  Direct the appropriate city staff to begin rezoning procedures for said property. The existing zoning classification of the property shall remain in effect until issuance of a development order relating to rezoning by the city council on the property. 
c.  In the case of developments of regional impact and planned unit developments, time limit restrictions shall be superseded by the phasing plan and/or time limits contained within the application for development approval and approved as part of a development order in conformance with F.S. § 380.06 or the planned unit development ordinance. 
(i)  Waiver of time limits. The time limits of subsection (h) above may be waived by four affirmative votes of the city council when such action is deemed necessary to prevent injustice or to facilitate the proper development of the city. 
(j)  Applications for rezones to a specific use. The applicant for any rezoning application may, at his or her option, propose a specific use or ranges of uses permitted under the zoning classification for which application has been made. As a condition of approval of such proposal, the development of the property which was the subject of the rezoning application shall be restricted to the approved use or range of uses. Any proposed addition to the approved use or range of uses shall require resubmittal of a rezoning application for the subject property. 
(k)  Rezoning; provision of adequate public facilities. The petitioner may provide all required community and public facilities and services in support of the requested rezoning in any one of the following manners: 
(1)  Petition for a rezoning at such time as all required adequate existing community and public facilities and services have been provided at public expense according to the capital improvement program; or 
(2)  Petition for a rezoning at such time as all required existing community and public facilities and services have been provided at the private expense of the petitioner; or 
(3)  Post a surety in lieu of completed improvements to guarantee that all of the required community and public facilities and services will be timely provided; or 
(4)  Facilities for parks and schools through land dedication or fee in lieu of such dedication; or 
(5)  Other method acceptable to city council.

(b)  Procedures for planned unit development zoning. Petitions for rezoning to PUD in accordance with this subsection shall be submitted and processed as for a rezoning amendment generally pursuant to this article and in accordance with the following special procedures: 
(1)  Pre-application conference. Prior to the submission of a formal application for rezoning to PUD, the applicant shall confer with the director and other city staffing agencies, and officials involved in the review and processing of such applications and related materials. The applicant is further encouraged to submit a tentative land use sketch plan for review at the conference, and to obtain information on any projected plans or programs relative to possible applicable federal or state requirements or other matters that may affect the proposed PUD. This pre-application conference should address, but not be limited to, such matters as: 
a.  The suitability of the area for the type and pattern of development proposed in relation to physical characteristics of the land, surrounding areas, traffic and access, drainage, sewer, water, and other utilities. 
b.  Adequacy of evidence of unified control and suitability of any proposed agreements, contract, or other instruments, or for amendments in those proposed, particularly as they may relate to arrangements or provisions to be made for the continuing operation and maintenance of such areas and facilities that are not to be provided or maintained at public expense. Findings and recommendations of this type shall be made only after consultation with the city attorney. 
c.  Conformity of the proposed PUD with the goals, objectives and policies of the growth management plan. 
d.  The internal and external compatibility of proposed uses, which conditions may include restrictions on location of improvements, restrictions on design, and buffeting and screening requirements.

g.  The ability of the subject property and of surrounding areas to accommodate expansion. 
h.  Conformity with PUD regulations, or as to desirable modifications of such regulations in the particular case, based on determination that such modifications are justified as meeting public purposes to a degree at least equivalent to literal application of such regulations. 
(2)  Pre-hearing conference. Any application for rezoning to PUD, together with all materials prescribed herein, shall be submitted to the director. Pre-hearing conferences may be held between the applicant and/or his representatives and officials or representatives of the city. The purpose of such pre-hearing conferences shall be to assist in bringing the application for rezoning to PUD as nearly as possible into conformity with the intent of these or other applicable regulations, and/or to define specifically any justifiable variations from the application of such regulations. 
(3)  Staff review and recommendation. Based upon its evaluation of the factors set forth above, the appropriate city staff shall prepare a report containing their review findings, and a recommendation of approval or denial. 
(4)  Application annulment. If an applicant fails to act upon a submitted application within a 90-day period after receiving written comments from the department, the application will be deemed withdrawn by the applicant. The director may extend the 90-day requirement if reasonable progress is being made in revising the application. For good cause shown or excusable delay, if a request is made in writing during the 90-day period, the director may extend the 90-day period until a reasonable time that the circumstances dictate. 
(c)  Hearing before the planning board. Public notice shall be given, and a public hearing held before the planning board on the application for rezoning to PUD as provided in section 30-62(f)(1), (2), and (3)a. of this LDC. Both the notice and the hearing shall identify the application, proposed PUD master plan of development, and required statements as they may have been amended as a result of the prehearing conference. The planning board hearing shall be conducted, continued, or rescheduled pursuant to section 30-62(e) of this LDC. 
(d)  Planning board recommendation. The planning board shall make written findings as required by subsection 30-62(c)(3)b. and below and as otherwise required in this section and shall recommend to city council either approval of the PUD rezoning as proposed; approval with conditions or modifications; or denial. In support of its recommendation, the planning board shall make findings as to the PUD master plan's compliance with the following criteria: 
(1)  The suitability of the area for the type and pattern of development proposed in relation to physical characteristics of the land, surrounding areas, traffic and access, drainage, sewer, water, and other utilities. 
(2)  Adequacy of evidence of unified control and suitability of any proposed agreements, contract, or other instruments, or for amendments in those proposed, particularly as they may relate to arrangements or provisions to be made for the continuing operation and maintenance of such areas and facilities that are not to be provided or maintained at public expense. Findings and recommendations of this type shall be made only after consultation with the city attorney. 
(3)  Conformity of the proposed PUD with the goals, objectives and policies of the growth management plan. 
(4)  The internal and external compatibility of proposed uses, which conditions may include restrictions on location of improvements, restrictions on design, and buffeting and screening requirements. 
(5)  The adequacy of usable open space areas in existence and as proposed to serve the development.

(e)  Action by city council. Unless the PUD application is withdrawn by the applicant, the city council shall, upon receipt of the planning board's recommendation, hold a public hearing on the application. Notice of the city council's public hearing shall be given as provided in section 30-62(f)(1), (2), and (3)b.1. or 2., as appropriate. The notice and hearing shall be on the application and PUD master plan of development as recommended by the planning board to city council. The city council public hearing shall be conducted, continued, or rescheduled pursuant to section 30-62(e) of this LDC. The city council shall either grant the proposed rezoning to PUD; approve with conditions or modifications; or deny the application for PUD rezoning. 
(f)  Effect of planned unit development zoning. If approved by city council, the master plan for development and all other information and materials formally submitted with the petition shall be considered and adopted as an amendment to the zoning code and shall become the standards of development for the subject PUD. Thenceforth, development in the area delineated as the PUD district on the official zoning atlas shall proceed only in accordance with the adopted development regulations and PUD master plan for said PUD district. 
    Before development of any type may proceed, all agreements, conditions of approval, and contracts required, but not approved at the time of amending action, shall be approved by appropriate officers or agencies of the city. Issuance of a final development order within any tract or increment within the PUD shall first require compliance with all sections of the city subdivision regulations and/or the site development plan regulations as appropriate. 
(g)  Time limits for approved PUD master plans. 
(1)  In the event that a PUD master plan is given approval, and the landowner(s) shall: 
a.  Fail to obtain approval for improvement plans or a development order for all infrastructure improvements to include utilities, roads and similar improvements required by the approved PUD master plan or other development orders for at least 15 percent of the gross land area of the PUD site every five years of the date of approval by city council; and 
b.  Fail to receive final local development orders for at least 15 percent of the total number of approved dwelling units in the PUD, or in the case of PUDs consisting of nonresidential uses, 30 percent of the total approved gross leasable floor area within the PUD every six years of the date of approval by city council. 
The project developer shall submit to the community development director a status report on the progress of development annually commencing on the third anniversary date of the PUD approval by city council. The singular purpose of the report will be to evaluate whether or not the project has commenced in earnest in accordance with the criteria set forth above. Should the community development director determine that the development has commenced in earnest, then the land shall retain its existing PUD approval and shall not be subject to additional review and consideration of new development standards or use modification. 
(2)  Should the community development director determine that the development has not commenced in earnest, then upon review and consideration of the report provided by the owner and any supplemental information that may be provided, city council shall elect one of the following: 
a.  To extend the current PUD approval for a maximum period of two years; at the end of which time, the owner will again submit to the procedure as defined herein. 
b.  Require the owner to submit an amended PUD in which the unimproved portions of the original PUD shall be consistent with the growth management plan. The existing PUD shall remain in effect until subsequent action by the board of the submitted amendment of the PUD. 
c.  If the owner fails to submit an amended PUD within six months of board action to require such an amended submittal, then the board may initiate proceedings to rezone the unimproved portions of the original PUD to an appropriate zoning classification consistent with the future land use element of the comprehensive plan. 
In the case of developments of regional impact, time limit restrictions shall be superseded by the phasing plan and/or time limits contained within the application for development approval and approved as part of a development order in conformance with F.S. § 380.06. 
(h)  Changes and amendments. Substantial/insubstantial changes. Any substantial change(s) to an approved PUD master plan shall require the review and recommendation of the plan by city council prior to implementation. Any insubstantial change(s) to an approved PUD master plan shall require approval by the planning board. For the purpose of this section, a substantial change shall be deemed to exist where: 
(1)  There is a proposed change in the boundary of the PUD; or 
(2)  There is a proposed increase in the total number of dwelling units or intensity of land use or height of buildings within the development; or 
(3)  There is a proposed decrease in preservation, conservation, recreation or open space areas within the development not to exceed five percent of the total acreage previously designated as such, or five acres in area; or 
(4)  There is a proposed increase in the size of areas used for nonresidential uses, to include institutional, commercial and industrial land uses (excluding preservation, conservation or open spaces), or a proposed relocation of nonresidential land uses; or 
(5)  There is a substantial increase in the impacts of the development which may include, but are not limited to, increases in traffic generation; changes in traffic circulation; or impacts on other public facilities; or 
(6)  The change will result in land use activities that generate a higher level of vehicular traffic based upon the Trip Generation Manual published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers; or 
(7)  The change will result in a requirement for increased stormwater retention, or will otherwise increase stormwater discharges; or 
(8)  The change will bring about a relationship to an abutting land use that would be incompatible with an adjacent land use; or 
(9)  Any modification to the PUD master plan or PUD document or amendment to a PUD ordinance which is inconsistent with the future land use element or other element of the comprehensive or which modification would increase the density or intensity of the permitted land uses; or 
(10)  The proposed change is to a PUD district designated as a development of regional impact (DRI) and approved pursuant to F.S. § 380.06, where such change requires a determination and public hearing by the city pursuant to F.S. § 380.06(19). Any change that meets the criterion of F.S. § 380.06(19)(e)2, and any changes to a DRI PUD master plan that clearly do not create a substantial deviation shall be reviewed and approved by the; or 
(11)  Any modification to the PUD master plan or PUD document or amendment to a PUD ordinance which impact(s) any consideration deemed to be a substantial modification as described under this article. 
(i)  Procedure for substantial/insubstantial change determination. 
(1)  The applicant shall provide the community development director documentation which adequately describes the proposed changes along with the appropriate review fee prior to review by the planning board. The PUD master plan map shall show all data normally required for submittal of a PUD master plan unless it is otherwise determined not to be necessary, describing the proposed changes in: land use; densities; infrastructure; open space, preservation or conservation areas; area of building square footage proposed for nonresidential development; change in potential intensity of land use and related automobile trip movements, and relationships to abutting land uses. In addition, the applicant, for evaluation of PUD master plan revisions, shall provide a detailed written narrative describing all of the change(s) and the reasons for the request. Upon receipt of the amended PUD master plan, the community development director shall review said plan against criteria established herein and may forward the plan to any other agency, division or authority deemed necessary for review and comment. 
Upon completion of the review, the community development director shall provide a written determination to the applicant, or his legal representative, confirming that the proposed change(s) do or do not constitute a substantial change to the approved PUD master plan based upon the evaluation of the criteria described herein. Any such determination made by the community development director may be appealed to city council. 
a.  Substantial changes procedures. Changes, as identified in subsection (h), shall be considered substantial changes to the approved PUD master plan, and the applicant shall be required to submit and process a new application complete with pertinent supporting data, as set forth in subsections (a)(1) and (2). 
b.  Insubstantial changes procedures. Any insubstantial change(s) to an approved PUD master plan based upon an evaluation of subsection (h) shall require the review and approval of the planning board based on the findings and criteria used for original applications as an action taken at a regularly scheduled meeting. 
c.  Language changes. Language changes to a previously approved PUD document shall require the same procedure as for amending the official zoning atlas. 
d.  Minor changes not otherwise provided for. It shall be understood that, while a PUD is required to describe and provide for infrastructure, intended land use types, approximate acreages of internal development tracts, and compatibility with adjacent land uses, minor changes may become necessary during the subdivision or site development plan review processes. 
(2)  The community development director shall also be authorized to allow minor changes to the PUD master plan during its subdivision improvements plan or site development plan process to accommodate topography, vegetation and other site conditions not identified or accounted for during its original submittal and review and when said changes have been determined to be compatible with adjacent land uses, have no impacts external to the site, existing or proposed, and is otherwise consistent with the provisions of this code and the growth management plan. Such changes shall include: 
a.  Internal realignment of right-of-ways, other than a relocation of access points to the PUD itself, where no water management facility, conservation/preservation areas, or required easements are affected or otherwise provided for. 
b.  Relocation of building envelopes when there is no encroachment upon required conservation or preservation areas. 
c.  Relocation of swimming pools, clubhouses, or other recreation facilities when such relocation will not affect adjacent properties or land uses. 
d.  Relocation or reconfiguration of lakes, ponds, or other water facilities subject to the submittal of revised water management plans, or approval of the environmental advisory board where applicable. 
Minor changes of the type described above shall nevertheless be reviewed by appropriate staff to ensure that said changes are otherwise in compliance with all city ordinances and regulations prior to the community development director's consideration for approval. 
(j)  Monitoring requirements. In order to ensure and verify that approved project densities or intensities of land will not be exceeded and that development commitments will be fulfilled, annual monitoring reports shall be submitted by the developer/owner or authorized agent of a PUP to the community development director. The monitoring report shall be submitted annually, on each anniversary of the date said PUD was approved by the board until the PUD is completely constructed and all commitments in the PUD document/master plan are met. The monitoring report shall provide the following information: 
(1)  Name of project. 
(2)  Name of owner, developer. 
(3)  Number of units, by residential type; square footage and acreage of recreation facilities, commercial and other permitted uses; infrastructure and/or other uses which are complete of [or] for which a valid permit has been issued, but which have not been completed. 
(4)  Up-to-date PUD master plan showing infrastructure, projects/developments, plats, parcels and other pertinent information. 
(5)  Traffic counts for all access points to the major highway network. 
(6)  Copies of all required monitoring reports completed in past year (i.e., traffic, wellfield, etc.). 
(7)  Up-to-date PUD document which includes all approved amendments. 
(8)  Status of commitments in PUD document. 
(9)  Other information as may be required by the community development director. 
(k)  Change of ownership. A change in ownership shall not absolve the original owner of the requirement to file an annual monitoring report. Transferring responsibility for filing the annual monitoring report to an entity other than the original owner may be demonstrated in the form of an executed agreement between the original owner and the new entity which when filed with the site development review director shall automatically transfer responsibility for filing the annual monitoring report. 
(l)  Interpretations of PUD documents. The community development director shall be authorized to interpret the PUD document.

Sec. 30-64. - Conditional use procedures. 
(a)  Nature of a conditional use. A conditional use is a use that would not be appropriate generally or without restriction throughout a particular zoning district or classification, which, if controlled as to number, area, location, or relation to the neighborhood, would promote the public health, safety, aesthetics, welfare, morals, order of comfort, convenience, appearance, or the general welfare. Such uses may be permissible in a zoning district as a conditional use if specific provision for such conditional use is made in the zoning district. Decisions regarding conditional uses shall be quasi-judicial in nature. 
(b)  Written petition. 
(1)  A written petition for a conditional use shall be submitted to the director indicating the basis in this zoning code under which the conditional use is sought and stating the grounds upon which it is requested, with particular reference to the types of findings which the city council must make under this section. The petition should include material necessary to demonstrate that the grant of conditional use will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this LDC, will be consistent with the comprehensive plan, will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to adjoining properties, or otherwise detrimental to the public health, safety, aesthetics, appearance, or welfare. No petition shall be deemed to be complete for review by the city until the application fee has been paid by the petitioner. Application fees may be set from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
(2)  Material to be submitted by a petitioner with a conditional use application shall include, but is not limited to, the following, where applicable: 
a.  Conceptual site development plans at an appropriate scale with all dimensions in legible format, showing the proposed placement of structures on the property, points of ingress and egress, height of structures, parking locations and parking spaces, architectural elevations of structures, provisions for ingress and egress, off-street parking and off-street loading areas, refuse and service areas, and required yards and setbacks, and other open spaces. The conceptual site development plan shall not be in lieu of, nor eliminate the need for, a site development plan under the land development code; 
b.  Plans showing proposed locations for utilities. Plans providing for screening and buffering with reference as to type, dimensions, and character; 
c.  Proposed landscaping and provisions for trees protected by city regulations; 
d.  Proposed signs and lighting, including type, dimensions, and character; 
e.  Developments shall identify, protect, conserve, and appropriately use native vegetative communities and wildlife habitat. Habitats and their boundaries shall be identified on a current aerial photograph of the property at a scale of at least one inch equals 400 feet. Habitat identification shall be consistent with the state department of transportation land use cover and forms classification system and shall be depicted on an aerial photograph. Information obtained by ground-truthing surveys shall take precedence over photographic evidence; and 
f.  Where this LDC places additional requirements on specific conditional uses, the petitioner shall demonstrate that such requirements are met. 
(3)  Concurrent processing of petitions. Where the rezoning of land, as well as grant of conditional use, is requested simultaneously for the same parcel of land, both petitions may be processed concurrently in accordance with the procedures set forth in this article. 
(4)  Application annulment. If a petitioner applicant fails to act upon a submitted petition within a 90-day period after receiving written comments from the department, the petition will be deemed withdrawn by the petitioner. The director may extend the 90-day requirement if reasonable progress is being made in revising the petition. For good cause shown or excusable delay, if a request is made in writing during the 90-day period, the director may extend the 90-day period until a reasonable time that the circumstances dictate. 
(c)  Planning board public hearing. 
(1)  Notice and public hearing. Notice and public hearing by the planning board shall be as provided for under section 30-62(f)(1), (2), and (3)a. of this LDC. All testimony given shall be under oath and the action by city council shall be quasi-judicial in nature. 
(2)  Standards for approval. Before any conditional use shall be recommended for approval to the city council, the planning board shall make findings that the proposed conditional use meets the following standards, as may be applicable: 
a.  That the granting of the conditional use will not adversely affect the public interest, and that the specific requirements governing the individual conditional use, if any, have been met by the petitioner; 
b.  That the grant of the conditional use is consistent with the comprehensive plan. A conditional use shall not be presumed to be consistent with the comprehensive plan merely because the use is listed in the LDC as a conditional use in a given zoning district; 
c.  That there is proper and adequate ingress to and egress from to property and proposed structures thereon with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control, and access in case of fire or catastrophe; 
d.  That the proposed conditional use is compatible with adjacent properties and other property in the district. The conditional use, as depicted on the conceptual site plan, must be compatible with adjacent and nearby uses, developments, structures, and neighborhoods and will not alter the character of the community and neighborhood or be contrary to emerging development trends in the community and the neighborhood; 
e.  Building orientation. That buildings are oriented so as to enhance the appearance of the streetscape. Mass, bulk and scale of all structures shall be compatible with other structures and uses in the neighborhood. 
(3)  Conditions and safeguards. 
a.  In recommending approval of any conditional use, the planning board may also recommend appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this LDC. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, which are made a part of the terms under which the conditional use is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this LDC. 
b.  Development of the conditional use shall be accomplished as set forth on the conceptual site plan. This is an automatic condition of approval of all conditional uses. 
(4)  Conduct of hearing; denial. 
a.  Any party may appear in person, by agent or attorney, or may submit written comments at the hearing or prior to the hearing in writing to the director. 
b.  The hearing shall be conducted according to the provisions of section 30-62(e). 
c.  If the planning board shall recommend denial of a conditional use, it shall state fully on the record its reason for doing so. Such reasons shall take into account the factors stated in subsection (c)(2) or such of them as may be applicable to the action of denial and the particular regulations relating to the specific conditional use requested, if any. 
(5)  Status of planning board report and recommendations. The report and recommendations of the planning board required above shall be advisory only and shall not be binding upon the city council. 
(d)  City council action on planning board report. 
(1)  Upon receipt of the planning board's report and recommendations, the city council shall conduct a public hearing and approve, by resolution, or deny a petition for a conditional use. The approval of a conditional use petition shall require four affirmative votes of said board. 
(2)  Conduct of hearing. 
a.  The hearing shall be conducted according to the provisions of section 30-62(e). 
b.  Notice shall be given pursuant to section 30-62(f)(1), (2), and (3)b.1. of this LDC. However, the conditional use shall be approved or denied by resolution. 
c.  Approval of the conditional use shall be based on the standards set forth in subsection (c)(2). 
(e)  Termination; extension. 
(1)  Any conditional use shall expire 365 days from the date of rendition of the development order granting approval by the city council, if by that date the use for which the conditional use was granted has not been commenced construction. 
(2)  Any conditional use shall expire 365 days following the discontinuance of the use for which the conditional use was approved. 
(3)  The city council may grant a maximum of three 365 day extensions of an approved conditional use upon written request of the petitioner. Each extension must be requested in writing with reasons for the extension prior to the expiration of the original conditional use. 
(f)  Conditional uses for school or religious purposes. A use that has been approved as part of a preliminary subdivision plat (formerly subdivision master plan) or a planned unit development for schools, religious or eleemosynary uses shall be exempt from the provisions of this section. Such uses must comply with the provisions for site development plan approval, as applicable, and all other zoning requirements. 
(g)  Changes and amendments. For good cause shown, the director may approve minor changes in the location, siting, or height of buildings, structures, and improvements authorized by the conditional use. Additional uses or expansion of permitted uses not shown on the conceptual site plan or otherwise specifically provided for in the conditional use application shall require submission, review and approval of a new conditional use application. 
(Ord. No. 02-08, § 4, 2-4-2002; Ord. No. 17-09 , § 5, 12-4-2017; Ord. No. 18-10 , § 4, 6-18-2018) 
Sec. 30-65. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  Purpose. A variance from the terms of this LDC may be granted based on the requirements of this section where said variance will not be contrary to the public interest, safety, aesthetics, or welfare and where owing to special conditions peculiar to the property; a diminution of a regulation is found to have no measurable impact on the public interest, aesthetics, safety or welfare; or a literal enforcement of the LDC would result in unnecessary and undue hardship, or practical difficulty to the owner of the property and would otherwise deny the property owner a level of utilization of his/her property that is consistent with the development pattern in the neighborhood and clearly has no adverse effect on the community at large or neighboring property owners. 
    The city council, based upon the evidence given in public hearing, and the findings of the planning board should determine to the maximum extent possible if the granting of the variance will diminish or otherwise have detrimental effect on the public interest, aesthetics, safety or welfare. A variance from the terms of this LDC may be granted based on the requirements of this section. 
(b)  Types of variances authorized. A variance is authorized for any dimensional development standard, including the following: height, area, and size of structure; height of fence; size of yards and open spaces; landscaping and buffering requirements; architectural and site design standards; and minimum requirements for off-street parking facilities. 
(c)  Exemptions. Minor after-the-fact yard encroachments may be approved administratively by the director. For the purposes of this subsection, minor yard encroachments shall be divided into three classifications: 
(1)  Structures for which a certificate of occupancy, or a final development order has not been granted. The director may administratively approve minor after-the-fact yard encroachments not to exceed a maximum of five inches. 
(2)  Structures for which a certificate of occupancy, or a final development order was granted after January 1, 1987. The director may administratively approve minor after-the-fact yard encroachments of up to 20 percent of the required yard, not to exceed a maximum of two and one-half feet. 
(3)  Structures for which a certificate or occupancy, or a final development order was granted before January 1, 1987. The director may administratively approve minor after-the-fact yard encroachments of up to 25 percent of the required yard, not to exceed a maximum of five feet. Further, the director may administratively approve vertical encroachments not to exceed 50 inches. 
(d)  Recycling in commercial districts. An administrative variance may be granted for site plan alterations made for the placement of structures up to five feet from any side or rear property line in order to accommodate recycling operations. Structures typically found in service function areas will be eligible for such relocation. Any such administrative variance, in addition to approval by the director, will also require the approval of the fire official. 
(e)  Procedure for request for minor after-the-fact encroachments. 
(1)  The property owner, or his agent, shall submit to the director a signed and sealed survey certified to and for reliance by the city identifying the exact location and size of the encroachment; a statement of how and when the encroachment was created; a statement of current ownership, and ownership at the time the encroachment was created; any other factors which may show that the encroachment was not intentionally created; and the applicable fee as listed in the schedule of fees. 
(2)  The director shall review the request for minor after-the-fact encroachments, and shall within 30 days of receipt of the request and application fee, notify the applicant in writing of its approval or denial based upon information provided by the applicant as described above. 
(3)  If denied by the director, all fees for the request for minor after-the-fact encroachments may be applied toward a variance request, if the variance request is received within 30 days after the date of the denial letter. 
(f)  Procedure for petition for variance . A written petition for a variance shall be submitted by the applicant to the director, together with payment of an application fee which may be set from time to time by resolution of the city council. If an applicant fails to act upon a submitted petition within a 90-day period after receiving written comments from the department, the application will be deemed withdrawn by the applicant. The director may extend the 90-day requirement if reasonable progress is being made in revising the application. For good cause shown or excusable delay, if a request is made in writing during the 90-day period, the director may extend the 90-day period until a reasonable time that the circumstances dictate. 
(g)  Planning board public hearing. 
(1)  Notice of planning board public hearing. Notice of the public hearing before the planning board shall be given as provided in subsection 30-62((f)(2) and (3)a. of this LDC. 
(2)  Conduct of hearing. 
a.  The public hearing shall be held by the planning board. Any party may appear in person, by agent or attorney, or may submit written comments at the hearing or prior to the hearing in writing to the director. 
b.  The hearing shall be conducted according to the provisions of subsection 30-62(e). 
c.  Approval of the variance shall be based on the standards set forth in subsection (g)(3). 
(3)  Standards for approval of a variance. Before any variance shall be recommended for approval to the city council, the planning board shall consider and be guided by the following standards in making a determination: 
a.  That there are special conditions and circumstances existing which are peculiar to the location, size and characteristics of the land, structure, or building involved; 
b.  That there are special conditions and circumstances which do not result from the action of the applicant such as pre-existing conditions relative to the property which is the subject of the variance request; 
c.  That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this LDC works an unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant or creates a practical difficulty on the applicant; 
d.  That the variance, if granted, will be the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure and which promote standards of health, safety or welfare; 
e.  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the petitioner any special privilege that is denied by this LDC to other lands, buildings, or structures in the same zoning district; 
f.  That granting the variance will be in harmony with the intent and purpose of this zoning code, and not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare; 
g.  That there are natural conditions or physically induced conditions that ameliorate the goals and objectives of the regulation such as natural preserves, lakes, golf course, or similar circumstances; and 
h.  That the granting of the variance will be consistent with the comprehensive plan. 
(4)  Conditions and safeguards. In recommending approval of any variance, the planning board may recommend appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this LDC including, but not limited to, reasonable time limits within which the action for which the variance is required shall begin or completed, or both. In the case of after-the-fact variances, the planning board may recommend, as a condition of approval, that in the case of the destruction of the encroaching structure, for any reason, to an extent equal to or greater than 50 percent of the actual replacement cost of the structure at the time of its destruction, any reconstruction shall conform to the provisions of this LDC in effect at the time of reconstruction. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this LDC. 
(5)  Recommendation of denial. If the planning board recommends denial of a variance, it shall state fully in its record its reason for doing so. Such reasons shall take into account the factors stated in subsection (g)(3), or such of them as may be applicable to the action of denial and the particular regulations relating to the specific variance requested if any. 
(6)  Status of planning board report and recommendations. The report and recommendation of the planning board required above shall be advisory only and shall not be binding upon the city council. 
(h)  City council action on planning board report. 
(1)  Upon receipt of the planning board's report and recommendations, the city council shall conduct a public hearing and approve, by resolution, or deny a petition for a variance. 
(2)  Conduct of hearing. 
a.  The hearing shall be conducted according to the provisions of subsection 30-62(e). 
b.  Notice shall be given pursuant to section 30-62(f)(2) and (3)b.1. of this LDC. 
c.  Any party may appear in person by agent or attorney; or may submit written comments to the director prior to the hearing or to city council at the hearing. 
d.  City council action. Upon consideration of the planning board's report, findings and recommendations, and upon consideration of the standards and guidelines set forth in subsection (g)(3), the city council shall approve, by resolution, or deny a petition for a variance. 
e.  Conditions and safeguards. In granting any variance, the city council may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this LDC, including, but not limited to, reasonable time limits within which action for which the variance is required shall be begun or completed, or both. In the case of after-the-fact variances, the city council may stipulate that in the case of destruction of the encroaching structure, for any reason, to an extent equal to or greater than 50 percent of the actual replacement cost of the structure at the time of its destruction, any reconstruction shall conform to the provisions of this LDC in effect at the time of reconstruction. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this LDC. 
f.  Limitations on power to grant variances. Under no circumstances shall the city council grant a variance to permit a use not permitted under the terms of this LDC in the zoning district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited, by the terms of these regulations in the said zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 02-08, § 5, 2-4-2002; Ord. No. 10-10, § 2.5., 8-16-2010; Ord. No. 17-09 , § 6, 12-4-2017; Ord. No. 18-10 , § 5, 6-18-2018; Ord. No. 18-11 , § 2, 6-18-2018) 
Sec. 30-66. - Building permit and certificate of occupancy compliance process. 
(a)  Zoning action on building permits. The community development director or designee shall be responsible for determining whether applications for building permits, as required by the city building code, are in accord with the requirements of this zoning code and the land development code, and no building permit shall be issued without approval that plans submitted conform to applicable zoning regulations, and other land development regulations. No building or structure shall be erected, moved, added to, altered, utilized or allowed to exist without first obtaining the authorization of the required building permit(s), inspections and certificate(s) of occupancy as required by the city building code and no building permit application shall be approved for the erection, moving, addition to, or alteration of any building or structure except in conformity with the provisions of this zoning code and the land development code unless he shall receive a written order from the board of zoning appeals in the form of an administrative review of the interpretation or variance as provided by this code or unless he shall receive a written order from a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction. 
(b)  Application for building permit. All applications for building permits shall, in addition to containing the information required by the building official, be accompanied by plot and construction plans drawn to scale, showing the actual shape and dimensions of the lot to be built upon; the sizes and locations on the lot of buildings already existing, if any; the size and location on the lot of the building or buildings to be erected, altered, or allowed to exist; the existing use of each building or buildings or parts thereof; the number of families the building is designed to accommodate; the location and number of required off-street parking and off-street loading spaces; approximate location of trees protected by city regulations; and such other information with regard to the lot and existing proposed structures as provide for the enforcement of this land development code. In the case of application of [for] a building permit on property adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico, a survey, certified by a land surveyor or engineer licensed in the State of Florida, and not older than 30 days shall be submitted. If there is a storm event or active erosion on a specific parcel of land for which a building permit is requested, which the site development review director determines may affect the density of the property, a more recent survey may be required. Where ownership or property lines are in doubt, the site development review director may require the submission of a survey, certified by a land surveyor or engineer licensed in the State of Florida. Property stakes shall be in place at the commencement of construction. 
(c)  Construction and use to be as provided in applications; status of permit issued in error. Building permits or certificates of occupancy issued on the basis of plans and specifications approved by the site development review director authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications, and no other use, arrangement, or construction. Use, arrangement, or construction different from that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this land development code. 
    Statements made by the applicant on the building permit application shall be deemed official statements. Approval of the application by the site development review director shall, in no way, exempt the applicant from strict observance of applicable provisions of this land development code and all other applicable regulations, ordinances, codes, and laws. 
    A building permit issued in error shall not confer any rights or privileges to the applicant to proceed to or continue with construction, and the city shall have the power to revoke such permit until said error is corrected. 
(d)  Adequate public facilities required. No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued except in accordance with the adequate public facilities required in the land development code. 
(e)  Improvement of property prohibited prior to issuance of building permit. No site work, removal of protected vegetation, grading, improvement of property or construction of any type may be commenced prior to the issuance of a building permit where the development proposed requires a building permit under this land development code or other applicable city regulations. Exceptions to this requirement may be granted by the community development director for an approved subdivision or site development plan to provide for distribution of fill excavated on site or to permit construction of an approved water management system, to minimize stockpiles and hauling off-site or to protect the public health, safety and welfare where clearing, grading and filling plans have been submitted and approved meeting the warrants of the land development code; removal of exotic vegetation shall be exempted upon receipt of a vegetation removal permit for exotics. 
(f)  Zoning and land use approval required prior to or simultaneously with issuance of building permit or occupancy of land and space. A zoning certificate, attesting to compliance with all aspects of the zoning provisions of the land development code, shall be required prior to obtaining a building permit or to occupying any space of land or buildings or for the conduct of a business in all zoning districts. The following zoning certificate review procedure shall provide for the issuance of a zoning certificate. 
    For the purposes of determining compliance with the zoning provisions of the land development code, an approval of a site development plan pursuant to the land development code, authorizes the issuance of a zoning certificate. Said zoning certificate shall constitute a statement of compliance with all applicable provisions of the land development code, including the uses of the building space upon which applicable off-street parking and loading requirements were based, however, issuance of a zoning certificate shall not exempt any person from full compliance with any applicable provision of the land development code. 
    In subdivided buildings each space for which a use is proposed requires a zoning certificate for that particular space, independent of any approval conferred upon the building and the land pursuant to the land development code and of a zoning certificate issued for the building and the land, shall be required. 
    A zoning certificate shall be required for any use of land or buildings located in residential zoning districts, which involve the conduct of a commercial or other non-residentially allowed uses of land or buildings. 
(Ord. No. 02-08, § 6, 2-4-2002) 
Sec. 30-67. - Affordable housing density bonus. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. This section is intended to implement and be consistent with the comprehensive plan, F.A.C. ch. 9J-5, and the Housing Program Interlocal Agreement by providing for moderate, low and very low income housing through the use of density bonuses which allow an increase in the number of residential dwelling units per acre allowed on property proposed for development, thereby decreasing the per unit cost and development. This objective is accomplished by implementing an AHDB program which consists of an AHDB rating system and an AHDB monitoring program. The purpose of the AHDB rating system is to provide increased residential densities to developers who guarantee that a portion of their housing development will be affordable by households of moderate, low or very low income, thus expanding housing opportunities for moderate, low and very low income households throughout the unincorporated city. The purpose of the AHDB monitoring program is to provide assurance that the program is properly implemented, monitored, and enforced, and that useful information on affordable housing may be collected. 
(b)  Affordable housing density bonus program. 
(1)  Addition of dwelling units to base density. The provision of affordable housing units may add up to eight dwelling units per gross acre to the base density of four residential dwelling units per gross acre, for a total of 12 residential dwelling units per gross acre, plus any other density bonuses available, and minus any density reduction for traffic congestion or coastal management area required, pursuant to the growth management plan, not to exceed a total of 16 dwelling units per gross acre. 
(2)  General requirement. In order to qualify for the AHDB for a development, the developer must apply for and obtain the AHDB from the city for a development in accordance with this section, including the AHDB rating system, the AHDB monitoring program, and the limitations on the AHDB. 
(3)  Preapplication conference. Prior to submitting an application for AHDB, a preapplication conference may be scheduled with the community development director and county housing staff. The preapplication conference provides an opportunity to familiarize the applicant with the AHDB program and provides an opportunity for the city staff to obtain a clear understanding of the proposed development. The AHDB rating system, the AHDB monitoring program, the imitations, criteria, procedures, standard conditions, standard forms, and other information will be discussed and made available to the applicant. Depending on the type of development proposed, the application may take the form of or be combined with, an application for a planned unit development (PUD), a rezone, or an AHDB development agreement. 
(4)  Application. An application for AHDB for a development shall be submitted to the community development director in the form established by the community development director. One additional copy of the application as otherwise required shall be provided for the housing and urban improvement director. The application shall, at a minimum, include: 
a.  Zoning districts proposed by the applicant, if any, on the property and acreage of each; 
b.  The total number of residential dwelling units in the proposed development, categorized by number of bedrooms and whether the unit is to be rented or owner-occupied; 
c.  The total number of AHDB units requested, categorized by number of bedrooms and whether the unit is to be rented or owner-occupied; 
d.  Total number of affordable housing units proposed in the development categorized by level of income, number of bedrooms, and rental units and owner-occupied units:

g.  Any other information which would reasonably be needed to address the request for AHDB for the development pursuant to the requirements set forth in this section. 
(5)  Staff review and recommendation by the community development director. After receipt of a completed application for AHDB, the community development director shall review and evaluate the application in light of the AHDB rating system, the AHDB monitoring program and the requirements of this division, and shall recommend to the planning board and city council to deny, grant, or grant with conditions, the application. The recommendation of the housing and urban improvement director shall include a report in support of his recommendation. 
(6)  Review and recommendation by the planning board. Upon receipt by the planning board of the application for AHDB and the written recommendation and report of the community development director, the planning board shall schedule and hold a properly advertised and duly noticed public hearing on the application. If the application has been submitted in conjunction with an application for a PUD, then the hearing shall be consolidated and made a part of the public hearing on the application for the PUD before the planning board, and the planning board shall consider the application for AHDB in conjunction with the application for the PUD. If the application has been submitted in conjunction with an application for a rezoning, then the hearing shall be consolidated and made a part of the public hearing on the application for rezoning before the planning board, and the planning board shall consider the application for AHDB in conjunction with the application for rezoning. In the event that the application for AHDB has not been submitted in conjunction with an application for PUD or an application for rezoning, then the application for AHDB shall nonetheless be treated as a rezoning on the property and shall comply with the requirements for a rezoning, as well as the requirements of this section. After the close of the public hearing, the planning board shall review and evaluate the application in light of the requirements of this division and the requirements for a rezoning, and shall recommend to the city council that the application be denied, granted or granted with conditions. However, in the event that the application for AHDB does not change the densities or intensities of use or the zoning on the property and does not require a rezoning or PUD application, then the application for AHDB shall comply with the requirements for development agreements under the city development agreement ordinance [Code chapter 38, article III], as well as the requirements of this section, in lieu of compliance with the rezoning requirement referenced in this section. 
(7)  Review and determination by city council. Upon receipt by city council of the application for AHDB and the written recommendation and report of the community development director and the recommendation of the planning board, city council shall schedule and hold a properly advertised and duly noticed public hearing on the application. If the application has been submitted in conjunction with an application for a planned unit development (PUD), then the hearing shall be consolidated and made a part of the public hearing on the application for the planned unit development (PUD) before the city council, and the city council shall consider the application for AHDB in conjunction with the application for the planned unit development (PUD). If the application has been submitted in conjunction with an application for a rezoning, then the hearing shall be consolidated and made a part of the public hearing on the application for rezoning before the city council, and city council shall consider the application for AHDB in conjunction with the application for rezoning. In the event that the application for AHDB has not been submitted in conjunction with an application for planned unit development (PUD) or an application for rezoning, then the application for AHDB shall nonetheless be treated as a rezoning on the property and shall comply with the requirements for a rezoning as well as the requirements of this section. After the close of the public hearing, city council shall review and evaluate the application in light of the requirements of this division and the requirements for a rezoning, and shall deny, grant, or grant with conditions, the application in accordance with the AHDB rating system and the AHDB monitoring program. However, if the application for AHDB does not change the densities or intensities of use or the zoning on the property and does not require a rezoning or planned unit development application, then the application for AHDB shall comply with the requirements for development agreements under the city development agreement ordinance [Code chapter 38, article III] as well as the requirements of this division, in lieu of compliance with the rezoning requirements referenced in this section. 
(8)  Affordable housing density bonus rating system. The AHDB rating system shall be used to determine the amount of the AHDB which may be granted for a development, based on household income level, number of bedrooms per affordable housing unit, type of affordable housing units (owner-occupied or rental, single-family or multifamily) and percentage of affordable housing units in the development. To use the AHDB rating system, Tables A and B, below, shall be used. Tables A and B shall be reviewed and updated, if necessary, on an annual basis by city council or its designee. 
a.  First, choose the household income level (moderate, low, or very low) of the affordable housing unit(s) proposed in the development, and the type of affordable housing units (owner-occupied or rental, single-family or multifamily, where applicable) to be provided, as shown in Table A. Then, referring again to Table A, choose the number of bedrooms proposed for the affordable housing unit(s). An AHDB rating based on the household income level and the number of bedrooms is shown in Table A. 
b.  After the AHDB rating has been determined in Table A, locate it in Table B, and determine the percentage of that type of affordable housing unit proposed in the development compared to the total number of dwelling units in the development. From this determination, Table B will indicate the maximum number of residential dwelling units per gross acre that may be added to the base density. These additional residential dwelling units per gross acre are the maximum AHDB available to that development. Developments with percentages of affordable housing units which fall in between the percentages shown on Table B shall receive an AHDB equal to the lower of the two percentages it lies between, plus one-tenth of a residential dwelling unit per gross acre for each additional percentage of affordable housing rental units in the development. For example, a development which has 24 percent of its total residential dwelling units as affordable housing units, and which has an AHDB rating of "4" will receive an AHDB of 4.4 residential dwelling units per gross acre for the development. 
c.  Where more than one type of affordable housing unit (based on level of income and number of bedrooms shown in Table A) is proposed for a development, the AHDB for each type shall be calculated separately in Table B. After the AHDB calculations for each type of affordable housing unit have been completed in Table B, the AHDB for each type of unit shall be added to those for the other type(s) to determine the maximum AHDB available for the development. In no event shall the AHDB exceed eight dwelling units per gross acre.

(9)  Limitations on affordable housing density bonus. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, the following limitations and conditions shall apply to all of the AHDB for a development: 
a.  Affordable housing density bonus development agreement required. The AHDB shall be available to a development only when an AHDB development agreement has been entered into by the developer/applicant and city council, and such agreement has been approved by the city attorney and city council pursuant to the public hearing process established in this division prior to execution. Amendments to such agreement shall be processed in the same manner as the original agreement. The AHDB development agreement shall include, at a minimum, the following provisions: 
1.  Legal description of the land subject to the agreement and the names of its legal and equitable owners. 
2.  Total number of residential dwelling units in the development. 
3.  Minimum number of affordable housing units, categorized by level of household income, type of unit (single-family or multifamily, owner-occupied or rental), and number of bedrooms, required in the development. 
4  Maximum number of AHDB dwelling units permitted in the development. 
5.  Gross residential density of the development. 
6.  Amount of monthly rent for rental units, or the price and conditions under which an owner-occupied unit will be sold, for each type of affordable housing unit in accordance with the definition for each type of affordable housing rental unit (moderate, low, and very low). 
7.  The foregoing notwithstanding, any rent charged for an affordable housing unit rented to a low or very low-income family shall not exceed 90 percent of the rent charged for a comparable market rate dwelling in the same or similar development. Comparable market rate means the rental amount charged for the last market rate dwelling unit of comparable square footage, amenities, and number of bedrooms, to be rented in the same development. 
8.  No affordable housing unit in the development shall be rented to a tenant whose household income has not been verified and certified in accordance with this division as moderate, low, or very low-income family. Such verification and certification shall be the responsibility of the developer and shall be submitted to the housing and urban improvement director for approval. Tenant income verification and certification shall be repeated annually to assure continued eligibility. 
9.  No affordable housing unit that is to be sold, leased with option to purchase, or otherwise conveyed in the development shall be sold, leased with option to purchase, or otherwise conveyed to a buyer whose household income has not been verified and certified in accordance with this division as moderate, low, or very low income family. Such verification and certification shall be the responsibility of the developer and shall be submitted to the housing and urban improvement director for approval. It is the intent of this division to keep housing affordable; therefore, any person who buys an affordable housing unit must agree, in a lien instrument to be recorded with the clerk of the circuit court of the county that if he sells the property (including the land and/or the unit) within 15 years after his original purchase at a sales price in excess of five percent per year of his original purchase price that he will pay to the city an amount equal to one-half of the sales price in excess of five percent increase per year. The lien instrument may be subordinated to a qualified first mortgage. 
10.  No affordable housing unit is any building or structure in the development shall be occupied by the developer, any person related to or affiliated with the developer, or a residential manager. 
11.  When the developer advertises, rents, sells or maintains the affordable housing unit, it must advertise, rent, sell and maintain the same in nondiscriminatory manner and make available any relevant information to any person who is interested in renting or purchasing such affordable housing unit. The developer shall agree to be responsible for payment of any real estate commissions and fees. The affordable housing units in the development shall be identified on all building plans submitted o the county and described in the application AHDB. 
12.  The developer shall not disclose to persons, other than the potential tenant, buyer or lender of the particular affordable housing unit or units, which units in the development are designated as affordable housing units. 
13.  The square footage, construction and design of the affordable housing units shall be the same as market rate dwelling units in the development. 
14.  The AHDB agreement and authorized development shall be consistent with the growth management plan and land development regulations of the city that are in effect at the time of development. Subsequently adopted laws and policies shall apply to the AHDB agreement and the development to the extent that they are not in conflict with the number, type of affordable housing units and the amount of AHDB approved for the development. 
15.  The affordable housing units shall be intermixed with, and not segregated from. The market rate dwelling units in the development. 
16.  The conditions contained in the AHDB development agreement shall constitute covenants, restrictions, and conditions, which shall run with the land and shall be binding upon the property and every person having any interest therein at anytime and from time to time. 
17.  The AHDB development agreement shall be recorded in the official records of the city subsequent to the recordation of the grant deed pursuant to which the developer acquires fee simple title to the property. 
18.  Each affordable housing unit shall be restricted to remain and be maintained as the type of affordable housing rental unit (moderate, low or very low income) designated in accordance with the AHDB development agreement for at least 15 years from the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for such unit. 
19.  The developer and owner of the development shall provide onsite management to assure appropriate security, maintenance and appearance of the development and the dwelling units where these issues are a factor. 
(10)  Compliance with the comprehensive plan and land development code. The AHDB shall be available to a development only to the extent that it otherwise complies and is consistent with the comprehensive plan and the land development code, including the procedures, requirements, conditions and criteria for planned unit development (PUDs) and rezonings, where applicable. 
(11)  Minimum number of affordable housing units. The minimum number of affordable housing units that shall be provided in a development pursuant to this division shall be ten affordable housing units. 
(12)  Nontransferable. The AHDB is not transferable between development or properties. 
(13)  Phasing. In the case where a development will occur in more than one phase, the percentage of affordable housing units to which the developer has committed for the total development shall be maintained in each phase on the property. For example, if the total development's AHDB is based on the provision of ten percent of the total dwelling units as affordable housing rental units for low income households with two bedrooms per unit, then each phase must maintain that same percentage (ten percent in this case) cumulatively. 
(14)  Affordable housing density bonus monitoring program. 
a.  Annual progress and monitoring report. The AHDB for a development shall be subject to the AHDB monitoring program set development director with an annual progress and monitoring report regarding the delivery of affordable housing rental units throughout the period of their construction, rental and occupancy for each of the developer's developments which involve the AHDB in a form developed by the community development director. The annual progress and monitoring report shall, at a minimum, require an information reasonably helpful to insure compliance with this division and provide information with regard to affordable housing. To the extent feasible, the director shall maintain public records of all dwelling units (AHDB and affordable housing units) constructed pursuant to the AHDB program, all affordable housing units constructed pursuant to the AHDB program, other records and information as community development director believes may be necessary or desirable to monitor the success of the AHDB program and the degree of compliance therewith. Failure to complete and submit the monitoring report to the housing and urban improvement director within 60 days form the due date will result in a penalty of up to $50.00 per day per incident or occurrence unless a written extension not to exceed 30 days is requested prior to expiration of the 60-day submission deadline. 
(15)  Income verification and certification. 
a.  Eligibility. The determination of eligibility of moderate, low, and very low-income families to rent or buy and occupy affordable housing units is the central component of the AHDB monitoring program. Family income eligibility is a three-step process: (1) submittal of an application by a buyer or tenant; (2) verification of family income; and (3) execution of an income certification. All three shall be accomplished prior to a buyer or tenant being qualified as an eligible family to rent or purchase and occupy an affordable housing unit pursuant to the AHDB program. No person shall occupy an affordable housing unit provided under the AHDB program prior to being qualified at the appropriate level of income (moderate, low or very low income). 
The developer shall be responsible for accepting applications from buyers or tenants, verifying income and obtaining the income certification for its development which involves AHDB, and all forms and documentation must be provided to the community development director prior to qualification of the buyer or tenant as a moderate, low or very low income family. The director shall review all documentation provided, and may verify the information provided from time to time. Prior to occupancy by a qualified buyer or tenant, the developer shall provide to the director, at a minimum, the application for affordable housing qualification, including the income verification form and the income certification form, and the purchase contract, lease, or rental agreement for that qualified buyer or tenant. At a minimum, the lease shall include the name, address and telephone number of the head of household and all other occupants, a description of the unit to be rented, the term of the lease, the rental amount, the use of the premises, and the rights and obligations of the parties. Random inspections to verify occupancy in accordance with this division may be conducted by the director. 
b.  Application. A potential buyer or tenant shall apply to the developer, owner, manager, or agent to qualify as a moderate, low, or very low-income family for the purpose of renting and occupying an affordable housing rental unit pursuant to the AHDB program. The application for affordable housing qualification shall be in a form provided by the director and may be a part of the income certification form. 
c.  Income verification. The community development director or the developer shall obtain written verification from the potential occupant (including the entire household) to verify all regular sources of income to the potential tenant (including the entire household). The written verification form shall include, at a minimum, the purpose of the verification, a statement to release information, employer verification of gross annual income or rate of pay, number of hours worked, frequency of pay, bonuses, tips and commissions and a signature block with the date of application. The verification may take the form of the most recent year's federal income tax return for the potential occupants (including the entire household), a statement to release information, tenant verification of the return, and a signature block with the date of application. The verification shall be valid for up to 90 days prior to occupancy. Upon expiration of the 90-day period, the information may be verbally updated from the original sources for an additional 30 days, provided it has been documented by the person preparing the original verification. After this time, a new verification form must be completed. 
d.  Income certification. Upon receipt of the application and verification of income, an income certification form shall be executed by the potential buyer or tenant (including the entire household) prior to sale or rental and occupancy of the affordable housing unit by the owner or tenant. Income certification that the potential occupant has a moderate, low, or very low household income qualifies the potential occupant as an eligible family to buy or rent and occupy an affordable housing unit under the AHDB program. The income certification shall be in a form provided by the community development director. 
(15)  Violations. It is a violation of this section to rent, sell or occupy, or attempt to rent, sell or occupy, an affordable housing rental unit provided under the AHDB program except as specifically permitted by the terms of this section, or to knowingly give false or misleading information with respect to any information required or requested by the community development director or by other persons pursuant to the authority which is delegated to them by this section.

b.  The entrance to the home shall be one of the most prominent elements of the facade. 
1.  Sidelight windows, decorative glass, and transoms add visual interest to the door, and are encouraged, but not required for building plan approval. 
(5)  Garages. 
a.  To further emphasize the subordinate role of the garage area to the total structural mass, one of the following shall be required: 
1.  The width of the garage door(s) shall not exceed 45 percent of the front facing facade. The measurement of the 45 percent shall be based on the distance, in linear feet, of the front facing facade; 
2.  The garage shall be a side-loading garage; 
3.  The garage shall be setback or set forward a minimum of two feet behind or in front of the plane of the front facade; or 
4.  No garage door shall exceed ten feet above grade.

c.  Painted lattice can be utilized to support and enhance the vegetative screening. 
(8)  Driveways. 
a.  Vehicle access facilities shall be constructed as described in section 30-483. 
b.  Vehicle access facilities shall have a minimum setback of 7.5 feet from any property line for front-loading garages or five feet for side-loading garages. The setback is required to facilitate the installation and maintenance of landscape materials. 
(9)  Site drainage. Site plans shall contain sufficient detail and information to allow for a review of proposed on-site drainage management. 
(10)  Erosion control. 
a.  Site plans shall contain sufficient detail and information to allow for a review of proposed on-site erosion control. 
b.  Appropriate erosion control devices, including property adjacent to seawalls, shall be installed prior to the initiation of construction, and shall be maintained throughout completion of the project. 
c.  Failure to maintain approved erosion control devices shall result in prompt code enforcement action and the suspension of on-site inspections until rectified. 
(11)  Unusual site topography. 
a.  On any lot where the average pre-development grade is greater than 18 inches above or 18 inches below the average crown of the adjacent road, the applicant shall incorporate the abutting right-of-way area into the site plans submitted for review. 
b.  The site plan shall contain sufficient detail of existing and proposed conditions within the abutting right-of-way area to facilitate review of proposed driveways, sidewalks, erosion control, utilities, and other improvements such as stormwater management.

DIVISION 13. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT 

Sec. 30-381. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose and intent of establishing the planned unit development district (PUD) is to provide procedures and standards to encourage mixed use planned developments that may be instituted at appropriate locations, all in accordance with the planning and development objectives of the city under this code and the comprehensive plan. It is further the purpose and intent of these PUD regulations to encourage ingenuity, innovation and imagination in the planning, design, and development or redevelopment of land under unified ownership or control. PUDs produced in compliance with the terms and provisions of this code and the comprehensive plan may depart from the strict application of setback, height, and minimum lot requirements of conventional zoning districts while maintaining minimum standards by which flexibility may be accomplished, and while protecting the public interest, so that: 
(1)  The development employs techniques featuring amenities and excellence in the form of variations in siting, mixed land uses and/or varied dwelling types, as well as adaptation to and conservation of the topography and other natural characteristics of the land involved. 
(2)  A more creative approach may be taken to the development of contiguous tracts of land and to encourage development of infill parcels of contiguous tracts of land in certain circumstances. 
(3)  A more desirable environment may be accomplished than would be possible through strict application of the minimum requirements of this zoning code. 
(4)  Land may be used more efficiently, resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets with consequent lower construction and future maintenance costs. 
    The maximum density permissible in a PUD district shall be guided by the density rating system contained in the future land use element of the city comprehensive plan. The maximum density permissible or permitted in a district shall not exceed the density permissible under the density rating system. 
(Ord. No. 02-07, § 1, 2-4-2002) 
Sec. 30-382. - Relationship to the comprehensive plan, zoning, subdivision, and other applicable regulations. 
(a)  All applications for PUDs shall be in full compliance with the future land use element and the goals, objectives, and policies of all elements of the comprehensive plan. All development regulations and other applicable provisions of all the city land development code, as may be amended, shall apply unless specifically modified by the approved PUD document and PUD master plan. 
(b)  Establishment of planned unit development districts. PUD districts shall hereafter be established by amendment of the official zoning atlas according to the procedures established in the land development code. 
(c)  Unified control. All land included for purpose of development within the PUD district shall be owned or under the control of the applicant for such zoning designation, whether that applicant be an individual, partnership or corporation, or a group of individuals, partnerships or corporations. The applicant shall present competent substantial evidence of the unified control of the entire area within the proposed PUD district and shall state agreement that if he proceeds with the proposed development he will do so in accordance with: 
(1)  The PUD master plan of development officially adopted for that district; 
(2)  Regulations and development standards as set forth in the PUD document and PUD master plan; 
(3)  Such other conditions or modifications as may be attached to the rezoning of land to the PUD classification; and 
(4)  The city comprehensive plan. 
    The applicant will provide written agreement, contracts, deed restrictions, or sureties acceptable to the city for completion of the undertaking in accord with the adopted PUD master plan as well as for the continuing operation and maintenance of such areas, functions and facilities that are not to be provided, operated or maintained at general public expense; and bind his successors in title to any commitments made under this division. 
(Ord. No. 02-07, § 2, 2-4-2002) 
Sec. 30-383. - Minimum area required. 
    The minimum area required for a PUD shall be ten contiguous acres except when located within the town center overlay where a five-acre minimum requirement must be met. Redevelopment projects within the town center overlay shall comprise a minimum of 21/2 contiguous acres. To be considered as a redevelopment project for PUD zoning purposes, the project must include at least three of the following components: 
(1)  Complete demolition of existing structures. 
(2)  Partial demolition and rehabilitation of existing structures. 
(3)  Complete rehabilitation (interior and exterior) of existing structures. 
(4)  Substantial modification and reconfiguration of ingress/egress points, vehicular parking areas, and pedestrian facilities. 
(5)  Incorporation of contiguous, vacant/infill parcels, into the development proposal. 
(6)  Incorporation of public/civic space within the project boundaries. 
(7)  Eligibility of the project for CDBG funding or actual CRA designation. 
For purposes of the planned unit development district only, the term "contiguous" shall include properties separated by either an intervening planned or developed public street right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 02-07, § 3, 2-4-2002; Ord. No. 02-34, § 3, 11-4-2002) 
Sec. 30-384. - Development planning. 
(a)  External relationship. Development within a PUD district shall be compatible with established or planned uses of surrounding neighborhoods and property. The PUD shall provide protection of the development from potentially adverse surrounding influences and protection of surrounding area from potentially adverse influences generated by or within the PUD. Such protection shall include, but is not limited to, adequate buffering and screening as follows: fences, walls, or vegetative screening at the boundaries of PUD districts shall be provided in accordance with the landscaping/buffering requirements of the land development code, to protect residents from undesirable views, lighting, noise or other adverse off-site influences, or to protect residents of adjoining districts from similar possible influences from within the PUD district. 
(b)  Internal relationships. The development plan for a PUD district shall provide for safe, efficient, convenient, and harmonious grouping of structures, uses and facilities, and for appropriate relation of space inside, outside, and between buildings for intended uses, common and recreational amenities, and structural features. 
(Ord. No. 02-07, § 4, 2-4-2002) 
Sec. 30-385. - Development standards. 
    In addition to all general provisions and procedures established in this division, the following specific requirements, limitations and standards shall apply to all PUD districts. 
(1)  Maximum residential densities. 
a.  Maximum residential density permissible for the overall PUD shall be guided by the density rating system contained in the future land use element of the comprehensive plan. The overall maximum residential density permissible or permitted in a PUD shall be calculated by dividing the total number of dwelling units by the total of gross acreage of the proposed PUD. In no event shall residential uses within a mixed-use structure(s) exceed 75 percent of the gross floor area of the building(s). 
b.  Density on a site specific basis may recognize the principles of clustering development where density may exceed the number of units per acre otherwise allowed over the entirety of the PUD, except as further provided for mixed use PUDs. The density on a parcel specific basis may be the maximum density achievable after application of the development standards that have been approved for the PUD, relative to each building parcel. Generally, clustered development will consist of two or more principal buildings, and the entire parcel specific development shall utilize all of the elements of a common architectural theme. Yard and spacing relationships between buildings may vary from the more traditional practice. 
c.  The city council may lessen density or intensity of development when it has been determined that development to the maximum density or intensity permissible in this division would: 
1.  Create inconvenient or unsafe access to the PUD; 
2.  Create traffic congestion in the streets which adjoin or lead to the PUD; 
3.  Place a burden on parks, recreational areas, schools, and other facilities which serve or are proposed to serve the PUD; 
4.  Be in conflict with the intent or provisions of the comprehensive plan; 
5.  Create a threat to property or incur abnormal public expense in areas subject to natural hazards; 
6.  Be incompatible or inconsistent with surrounding neighborhoods or areas; or 
7.  Otherwise be inappropriate. 
(Ord. No. 02-07, § 5, 2-4-2002) 
Sec. 30-386. - Minimum dimensional standards within a PUD. 
    Dimensional standards within any tract or increment of the proposed PUD shall conform to the minimum dimensional and other standards of the zoning district to which it most closely resembles in type, density, and intensity of use. Where there is uncertainty, the more restrictive standards shall apply. Variation from these minimum dimensional standards may be approved if the PUD demonstrates unique or innovative design. For purpose of this section, examples of unique and innovative design may include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Providing usable common open space within individual tracts or increments to offset and compensate for decreases in typical lot sizes or yard requirements. 
(2)  Providing for public access to open space areas beyond the boundaries of the property. 
(3)  The use(s) occurring within the PUD are such that compatibility with surrounding uses can be assured by applying different requirements than would be applicable under another zoning district. 
(4)  Providing places for public assembly such as parks and plazas which are linked together and centrally located to ensure accessibility. 
(5)  Siting buildings and dwelling units to provide optimum access to open space areas. 
(6)  Providing for the integration and preservation of natural resources with development, through conservation of natural resources such as streams, lakes, floodplains, groundwater, wooded areas and areas of unusual beauty or importance to the natural ecosystem. 
    Submission of schematic architectural drawings, site plans, floor plans, elevations, and perspectives which shall graphically demonstrate the proposed reduction in dimensional standards for all proposed land use types and their accessory uses within the PUD shall also be required to provide support documentation for reduction in the minimum standards of the zoning code. 
(Ord. No. 02-07, § 6, 2-4-2002) 
Sec. 30-387. - Usable open space requirements. 
(a)  Minimums. As a requirement for approval, all PUDs shall provide open space consistent with the following minimums: 
(1)  Within PUD districts composed entirely of residential dwelling units and accessory uses, at least 50 percent of the gross area shall be devoted to usable open space. 
(2)  Within PUD districts containing both commercial and residential uses, at least 30 percent of the gross area shall be devoted to usable open space. 
(3)  Within redevelopment project PUDs in the town center overlay, at least 20 percent of the gross area shall be devoted to usable open space. 
Usable open space shall include active and passive recreation areas. Open water areas beyond the perimeter of the site and internal street rights-of-way, driveways, shall not be counted in determining usable open space. 
(b)  Dedication of usable open space. An appropriate percentage of the gross project area shall be required to be dedicated to public use as usable open space for all development after a determination by the city council that a public need exists for such public facilities and that the amount of area dedicated is directly related to the impacts or needs created by the proposed development. 
(c)  Dedication of the public facilities and development of prescribed amenities. The city council may, as a condition of approval and adoption of the PUD rezoning and in accordance with the approved master plan of development, require that suitable areas for streets, public right-of-way, schools, parks, and other public facilities be set aside, improved, and/or dedicated for public use. Where impact fees are levied for certain public facilities, the market value of the land set aside for the public purpose shall be credited towards impact fees. Said credit shall be based on a negotiated amount no greater than the market value of the set aside land prior to the rezoning action, as determined by an accredited appraiser from a list approved by the city. Said appraisal shall be submitted to the city attorney's office and the real property office within 90 days of the date of approval of the rezone, or as otherwise extended in writing by city, so as to establish the amount of any impact fee credits resulting from said dedication. Failure to provide said appraisal within this time frame shall authorize the county to determine the market value of the property. Impact fee credits shall only be effective after recordation of the document conveying the dedicated property to the city. 
    Land set aside and/or to be improved as committed in the PUD document, or master plan, as the case may be, shall be deeded or dedicated to the city within 90 days of receipt of notification by the city that the property is needed for certain pending public improvements or as otherwise approved by the city council during the PUD rezoning approval process. In any case, however, the city shall take title to the set aside property, at the latest, by a date certain established during, and conditioned on, the approval of the PUD zoning. The land set aside and/or to be improved shall be made free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and improvements, at the developer's sole expense, except as otherwise approved by the city council. Failure to complete the dedication within the appropriate time frame noted above may result in a recommendation to the city council of consideration of rezoning the subject parcel from its current PUD zoning district to an appropriate zoning district and may result in a violation of this division. 
    Should said dedication of land also include agreed upon improvements, said improvements shall be completed and accepted by the city council at the development phase which has infrastructure improvements available to the parcel of land upon which said improvements are to be made, or at a specified time provided for within the PUD document. 
(d)  Common open space or common facilities. Any common open space or common facilities established by an adopted master plan of development for a PUD district shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  The PUD shall provide for and establish an organization for the ownership and maintenance of any common open space and/or common facilities, and such organization shall not be dissolved nor shall it dispose of any common open space or common facilities, by sale or otherwise, except to an organization conceived and established to own and maintain the common open space or common facilities. However, the conditions of transfer shall conform to the adopted PUD master plan. 
(2)  In the event that the organization established to own and maintain common open space or common facilities, or any successor organization, shall at any time after the establishment of the PUD fail to meet conditions in accordance with the adopted PUD master plan of development, the community development director may serve written notice upon such organization and/or the owners or residents of the planned unit development and hold a public hearing. If deficiencies of maintenance are not corrected within 30 days after such notice and hearing, the community development director shall call upon any public or private agency to maintain the common open space for a period of one year. When the community development director determines that the subject organization is not prepared or able to maintain the common open space or common facilities, such public or private agency shall continue maintenance for yearly periods. 
(3)  The cost of such maintenance by such agency shall be assessed proportionally against the properties within the PUD that have a right of enjoyment of the common open space or common facilities and shall become a lien on said properties. 
(e)  Preservation and protection of desirable natural historic or archaeological features. The desirable natural, historic, or archaeological features of the site including trees and other vegetation of consequence of a PUD district shall be preserved and protected. The disturbance of terrain or vegetation in a manner likely to significantly increase either wind or water erosion within or adjacent to the PUD district is prohibited. 
(f)  Utilities. Within the residential portion of a PUD district, all utilities, including telephone, television cable, and electrical systems, shall be installed underground; provided, however, appurtenances to these systems which require aboveground installation must be opaquely screened and thereby may be exempted from these requirements; and primary facilities providing service to the site of the development or necessary to service areas outside the district may be exempted from this requirement. 
(g)  Streets, drives, parking and service areas. Streets, drives, parking, and service areas shall provide safe and convenient access to dwelling units and project facilities, and for service and emergency vehicles. 
(1)  Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to provide smooth traffic flow and minimize hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. The public works director shall determine when merging and turn lanes and/or traffic dividers shall be required. Where streets within the district intersect adjoining streets, visibility triangle shall be maintained. 
(2)  All streets or roads within the PUD shall be public unless specifically identified and approved as private on the PUD master plan, and shall comply with all applicable city requirements for streets and roads.

(Ord. No. 02-22, § 2, 7-15-2002) 
Sec. 30-433. - Landscaping and irrigation plan procedures. 
    Landscape plan required. Prior to the issuance of any subdivision plat or site development plan, an applicant whose development is covered by the requirements of this code shall submit a complete landscape plan to the community development director or his designee. This includes commercial, institutional, and multifamily developments. The landscape plan shall be prepared by and bear the seal of a registered landscape architect. 
(1)  Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a single-family residence, the owner or owners' representative shall prepare and submit a copy of the final "as-built" survey that accurately depicts the approximate location of code-required landscaping materials on the property, including the common name of tree species installed, and the height at the time of planting. This landscape plan will be used in conjunction with the final inspection of the single-family residence, and kept as part of the permanent file. 
Except in the case of a single-family residence, as described above, the landscape plan shall be drawn to a suitable scale, include dimensions, north arrow, date, title, project owner's name and address, delineate the existing and proposed parking, vehicular use areas, buildings, access points and roadways, show all utility lines or easements, and show the location of existing and proposed planting areas and vegetation communities and designate them by species name. The code-required landscaping shall be highlighted or indicated on the plan to differentiate from the applicant's provided landscaping that is in addition to that required by this code. Design creativity is encouraged so long as it meets the intent of this code. The plan shall show the location of permanent vegetation protection devices, such as barricades, curbing, and tree wells. The plan shall also include a chart indicating graphic plant symbol, botanical and common name, quantity, height, spread, spacing, native status, drought tolerance rating (as defined by "Florida Friendly Landscaping", as may be amended from time to time, published by Florida Department of Environmental Protection and University of Florida, Florida-Friendly Landscape Guidance Models for Ordinances, Covenants, and Restrictions) and type of industry practices and standards. In addition, a tabulation of the code-required landscaping indicating the calculations necessary to ensure compliance with this code should also appear. A certificate of occupancy permit shall not be issued until approval of the landscaping plan and installation of plants are inspected by the city. 
(2)  Irrigation plan required. All new single-family residences, multifamily, commercial and institutional developments shall be irrigated by the use of an automatic irrigation system with controller set to apply water in a manner consistent with this code. Irrigation plans for multifamily, commercial and institutional developments shall be prepared by persons qualified to prepare irrigation plans, such as an irrigation designer or landscape architect. Moisture detection devices shall be installed with all automatic sprinkler systems to override the sprinkler activation mechanism during periods of increased rainfall. Where existing irrigation systems are modified requiring the acquisition of a permit, automatic activation systems and overriding moisture detection devices shall be installed in compliance with this code. 
Required irrigation installed at single-family residences does not require the submittal of an irrigation plan. The system must be installed by a licensed professional prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. As part of the final inspections for the residence, the irrigation system will be inspected to ensure the inclusion of the following system elements: control valve; vacuum breaker; timer (clock); and rain sensor. 
a.  The irrigation plan shall be drawn at the same scale as the landscape plan to: show existing vegetation to remain; delineate existing and proposed buildings and other site improvements, parking spaces, aisles, and driveways; indicate main valve, and pump locations, pipe sizes and specifications; show controller locations and specifications; show backflow preventer and rain-sensing devices and include a sprinkler-zoning plan indication type, specifications, spacing, and coverage. If drip irrigation or soaker hoses are proposed, their layout shall be shown. 
b.  Reference the city public right-of-way ordinance for irrigation system requirements within the public right-of-way. (Reserved.) 
(3)  Existing plant communities. Existing plant communities and ecosystems shall be maintained in a natural state and shall not be required to be irrigated. Native plant areas that are supplements to an existing plant community or newly installed by the applicant shall be irrigated on a temporary basis only during the period of establishment from a temporary irrigation system, water truck, or by hand watering with a hose. 
(4)  Cultivated landscapes. Cultivated landscape areas (sod, shrubs, and trees) shall be provided with an automatic irrigation system to improve the survivability of the required landscaping. Sprinkler heads irrigating lawns or other high water demand areas shall be zoned separately from those irrigating trees, shrubbery, groundcover, flowers, or other reduced water requirement areas. Automatically controlled irrigation systems shall be operated by an irrigation controller that is capable of watering "high water" requirement areas at different frequencies and duration than "low water requirement areas". Landscaping shall only be watered on as-needed basis. 
(5)  Irrigation systems. Irrigation systems shall be designed for the zoning of high and low water use areas. Plans shall include in schedule form, the irrigation system's total gallons per minute (GPM) for each zone, recommended zone running times in minutes, hours and showing days per week, and estimated zone precipitation rate in inches per hour. The irrigation system shall be generally designed to apply one inch of water per week during two operations per week. The system coverage shall be designed for 100 percent coverage unless specified by the designer. The system shall be generally designed for the 100 percent head-to-head coverage as generally recommended by the irrigation sprinkler manufacturers for matched precipitation. These requirements may be adjusted for retention areas. The irrigation system shall be designed and installed in accordance with the Florida Irrigation Society's, Standards and Specifications for Turf and Landscape Irrigation Systems (as amended). Irrigation systems utilizing well water shall be designed and maintained in a manner which eliminates staining of the building, walks, walls, and other site improvements. All systems shall be designed to minimize the application of water onto sidewalks, driveways, streets, and other impervious areas. Irrigation systems, other than drip or soaker hose systems, shall be operated between the hours of midnight and 8:00 a.m. South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD), the city, or other utility company water use restrictions shall supersede these requirements. There are no operational requirements for irrigation systems utilizing effluent/reused water sources. 
(6)  Installation. Prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy permit for a use required to provide landscaping and irrigation in accordance with this section, all required landscaping and irrigation shall be installed and in place as set out in this code. All plant materials must be installed in accordance with accepted landscape practices in the area and meet the plant material standards contained in this code. Plant materials shall be installed in soil conditions that are conducive to the proper growth and the plant material. 
(Ord. No. 02-22, § 3, 7-15-2002; Ord. No. 11-07, § 2, 6-20-2011) 
Sec. 30-434. - Pruning, maintenance, and removal. 
(a)  Pruning. Vegetation required by this Code shall be pruned by property owners to promote healthy, uniform, natural growth of the vegetation. Pruning shall be performed in accordance with the current edition of pruning standards published by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) A300 Pruning Standards, ANSI Z133.1 Safety Standards. Trees shall not be severely pruned in a manner that would damage the vegetation and permanently restrict growth or height. Severely pruned trees are considered damaged and a public nuisance, which shall be replaced with trees equal to the number and height of the damaged trees. A plant's growth habit shall be considered to determine the extent of pruning necessary to maintain healthy growth. 
(1)  Utility pruning. Utilities shall conform to current ANSI A-300 standards when performing line clearing work within public right-of-way. All utilities shall notify the city manager or designee by electronic communication or mail no later than 30 business days prior to performing any utility line clearing work within public right-of-ways. Franchised utilities, after notifying the city manager or designee, shall meet with the city manager or designee to review and approve plans and schedules for utility line clearing work. Franchised utilities shall have an ISA certified arborist directing the pruning of public and private trees. Utility pruning should only provide minimum safe clearance to protect energized power lines with consideration for the combined movement of the conductors near trees in severe weather, the species of the tree, and the voltage of the conductor. 
(2)  Canopy and root pruning. When activities affect public or private trees so that more than 50 percent of the area within the dripline is disturbed, or when pruning must be performed on the crown of a public or private tree, the following arboricultural techniques are required: 
a.  When the area within the dripline will be disturbed, the affected roots must be severed by clean pruning cuts where the activity impacts the roots. Roots may be pruned by utilizing trenching equipment that is specifically designed for this purpose or by hand digging a trench and pruning roots with a chain saw, pruning saw or other equipment designed for tree pruning. Roots within the dripline shall be pruned to a depth of 12 inches below existing grade or to the depth of the disturbance if less than 12 inches from the existing grade. When underground utilities are to be installed through the dripline, root pruning requirements may be waived by the city manager or designee if the lines are installed via tunneling or directional boring. 
b.  All pruning of public or private trees shall conform to the current ANSI standards defined herein and shall be supervised by an ISA certified arborist. There shall be no flush cuts, stub cuts, or lion's tailing of the crown of the tree. 
c.  It shall be a violation of this section to perform the techniques of topping, hatracking or other pruning techniques that remove the vertical leader stems or other pruning which results in an unnecessary reduction of shade of public or private trees. 
(b)  Maintenance. The owner shall be responsible for the continued maintenance and upkeep of all required landscaping so as to present a healthy plant in a condition representative of the species. Tree and palm staking shall be removed between six and 12 months after installation. All landscapes shall be kept free of refuse, debris, disease, pests, and weeds and shall be fertilized and irrigated to maintain plants in a healthy condition. Special maintenance requirements necessary to preserve the design professional's intent shall be noted on the planting plan. 
(1)  Care and maintenance of permitted private trees on city owned property. The care and maintenance of all private trees permitted on city owned property shall be the responsibility of the adjacent property owner. A permit shall be obtained from the city manager or designee prior to planting a private tree in the public right-of-way or on other city property. Property owners shall adhere to the maintenance and pruning standards contained herein when maintaining privately-owned trees on city property. Property owners must apply for a vegetation removal permit from the city manager or designee in accordance with Code article XIV and a permit to replace any private tree in the right-of-way in accordance with Code section 30-435. 
(2)  Care and maintenance of public trees on city owned property. The city manager shall designate a department to be responsible for the care and maintenance of public trees on city owned property. Public trees are city street trees, median trees and cul-de-sac trees as defined in section 30-10. The department shall adhere to the maintenance and pruning standards contained herein when maintaining public trees on city property. The department director shall make reports and requests for funds for the care and maintenance of public trees, including needed planting and replanting, to the city council as part of the annual budget approval process. Before removing any public tree from the right-of-way, the department director shall notify the city manager and any other affected department directors. 
(3)  Private care and maintenance of public trees on city owned property. Private property owners may make a written request to the city manager or designee for permission to care for and maintain public trees on public property. Property owners shall adhere to the maintenance and pruning standards contained herein when maintaining publically owned trees on city property. Before replanting, removal or replacement of any public tree, a private property owner shall obtain the permission of the city manager or designee to plant the tree, shrub or other vegetation and if necessary apply for a vegetation removal permit from the city manager or designee in accordance with article XIV. If the replanting shall be in the right-of-way, the property owner shall obtain a permit from the city manager or designee in accordance with section 42-76. Fees for a permit for vegetation removal or replanting shall be waived for public trees. 
(c)  Removal of damaged or nuisance trees. Ongoing maintenance to prohibit the establishment of prohibited exotic species is required. Any plant materials of whatsoever type or kind required by these regulations shall be replaced within 30 days of their demise and/or removal. 
(d)  Compliance. Code compliance will inspect areas affected by this code and issue citations for violations. If the required corrective action is not taken within the time allowed, the city may use any available means of enforcement to secure compliance including, but not limited to: 
(1)  Prosecution before the city code enforcement board; 
(2)  Withholding of any permit, construction plan approval, certificate of occupancy, or inspection by the city; and 
(3)  Placing a lien on the property, to include all administrative, legal, material and installation costs.

Sec. 30-441. - Minimum landscape buffering and screening between uses. 
(a)  Applicability. The buffering and screening shown in Table 1 shall be required under this section and shall apply to all new and redevelopment of commercial, institutional, and multifamily development. Existing landscaping which does not comply with the provisions of this section shall be brought into conformity to the maximum extent possible when the vehicular use area is altered or expanded except for restriping of lots/drives, the building square footage is changed, or the structure or a unit within the structure has been vacant for a period of 30 consecutive days or more and a request for an occupational license to resume business is made. 
(b)  The buffering and screening provisions of this code will be applicable at the time of planned unit development (PUD), subdivision plat (PSP), or site development plan (SDP) review, with the installation of the buffering and screening required pursuant to Table 2. Where a more intensive land use is developed contiguous to a property within a similar zoning district, the community development director or designee may require buffering and screening the same as for the higher intensity uses. 
(c)  Landscape buffering and screening standards shall conform to the minimum buffering and screening standards of the zoning district it most closely resembles. The community development director or designee may approve alternative landscape buffering and screening standards when such alternative standards have been determined by use of professional acceptable standards to be equivalent to or in excess of the intent of this code. 
(d)  Standards. Trees and shrubs shall be installed at the height specified in this code, unless otherwise noted. 
(e)  Water management systems, which shall include retention and detention areas, swales, and subsurface installations, shall be permitted within a required buffer provided they are consistent with accepted engineering and landscaping practice and the following criteria: 
(1)  Water management systems shall not exceed 50 percent of the square footage of any required side, rear, or front yard landscape buffer. 
(2)  Water management systems shall not exceed 70 percent of the required buffer width. A minimum five-foot wide 10:1 level planting area shall be maintained where trees and hedges are required. 
(3)  Exceptions to these standards may be granted on a case-by-case basis, evaluated on the following criteria: 
a.  Water management systems, in the form of dry retention, may utilize an area greater than 50 percent of the buffer when existing native vegetation is retained at natural grade. 
b.  For lots of record 10,000 square feet or less in size, water management areas may utilize an area greater than 50 percent of the required side and rear yard buffers. A level planting area of at least three feet in width shall be provided in these buffers. 
(f)  Vehicular use, or any other impervious areas shall not occupy any part of a required alternative A, B, or C type buffer except as written below: 
(1)  Driveways and sidewalks that are constructed perpendicular to the required buffer and provide direct access to the property; 
(2)  Parallel meandering sidewalks occupy the buffer and its width is increased by the equivalent sidewalk width. 
(g)  Types of buffers. Within a required buffer area, the following alternative shall be used based on the matrix in Table 2. 
    Alternative A: Ten-foot-wide landscape buffer with trees spaced no more than 30 feet on center. 
    Alternative B: Fifteen-foot-wide, opaque within one year, landscape buffer maintained at six feet in height, which may include a wall, fence, hedge, berm or combination thereof, including trees spaced no more than 25 feet on center. When planting a hedge, it shall be a minimum of ten gallon plants, 48 inches in height, three feet in spread and spaced a minimum four feet on center at planting. 
    Alternative C: A landscape buffer shall be required adjacent to any road right-of-way external to the development project. Said landscape buffer shall be consistent with the provisions of the city master plan, which is incorporated by reference herein. The minimum width of the perimeter landscape buffer shall vary according to the ultimate width of the abutting right-of-way. Where the ultimate width of the right-of-way is zero to 99 feet, the corresponding landscape buffer shall measure at least ten feet in width. Where the ultimate width of the right-of-way is 100 or more feet, the corresponding landscape buffer shall measure at least 15 feet in width. Developments within the town center mixed use district shall provide a perimeter buffer of at least 20 feet in width, regardless of the width of the right-of-way. The exception to this landscape buffer requirement is property located within the Elkcam Circle Overlay as provided for in the land development code. The town center mixed use district right-of-way buffer requirements shall not be applicable to roadways internal to the development or along alleys, however, these areas shall provide the applicable landscape buffer per this code. 
    Trees shall be provided in an amount equivalent of one tree per 30 feet of buffer length abutting the right-of-way. Trees shall be spaced so to provide for an unimpeded proper and mature growth of the trees being used. Trees with less than a 20 foot crown spread shall not be used within this buffer unless under overhead utilities or are trees above the number required of this code. Applicants whose properties require installation of type "C" buffers within 500 feet of a major arterial or collector roadway intersection shall install required canopy trees at 16-18 feet heights with seven-foot minimum canopy spread, 4 inch diameter caliper and seven-foot clear trunks or palms with 15-foot clear trunks within the type "C" buffer areas. 
    A double hedge row of at least 24 inches in height at the time of planting and attaining a minimum of three feet height within one year shall be required in the landscape buffer where vehicular areas and parking spaces are adjacent to the road right-of-way. 
    The remaining area of the landscape buffer shall consist of existing native vegetation, grass, ground cover, or other landscape treatment. Every effort shall be made to retain and incorporate the existing native vegetation in these areas. 
    Type "C" buffers shall be permitted to utilize the adjacent right-of-way roadway shoulder for landscape and retention area purposes and based upon the following conditions: 
(1)  A meandering sidewalk is provided crossing back and forth over the property or right-of-way line. 
(2)  Retention areas recreated so to be shallow dry type retention areas and not continuous in line or length. Retention areas must also be interconnected with piped drainage systems and connected into the site's overall system or outfall area. 
(3)  Include along each right-of-way one pedestrian entrance/rest area containing decorative paving, one bench, one bike rack and one trash receptacle. The one per right-of-way requirement can be reduced to one if the pedestrian entry/rest area is located at the corner of the property at a roadway intersection and enlarged in areas containing two each of the above listed site furnishings. Parking requirements may be reduced by one space per pedestrian entry/rest area. 
(4)  The plan and layout is approved by the city's public works director and the community development director or designee.

Sec. 30-521. - Scope, purpose and intent, substitution and severability. 
(a)  Scope. 
(1)  The provisions of this article shall govern the number, size, location, and character of all signs which may be permitted either as a main or accessory use under the terms of this article. No signs shall be permitted on a plot or parcel either as a main or accessory use except in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(2)  This article does not regulate the following: 
a.  Directional, hazard, life safety, traffic control device, wayfinding and similar signs required or installed by a government agency on public or private property. 
b.  Noncommercial athletic field score boards, including sponsor identification, located within a public park and facing the playing field or public viewing stands. 
c.  Notices required to be posted by law or ordinance on public or private property. 
(3)  In the event of any conflict between this article and any declaration of covenants, bylaws, or other restrictions applying to any property within the city, the language affording the more restrictive interpretation shall apply. 
(4)  The city specifically finds that these sign regulations are narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling and substantial governmental interests of traffic safety and aesthetics, and that there is no other way for the city to further these interests. 
(b)  Purpose and intent. It is the purpose and intent of this article to provide specific signage development standards and design regulations to ensure the orderly and appropriate installation, design and construction of individual signs. 
(1)  Florida Constitution . Article II, Section 7 of the Florida Constitution provides that "[i]t shall be the policy of the state to conserve and protect its natural resources and scenic beauty...." A beautiful environment preserves and enhances the desirability of the city as a place to live and to do business. Implementing the Florida Constitution is a compelling governmental interest. 
(2)  Florida Statutes . Florida law requires local governments to adopt comprehensive plans and implement them through land development regulations (also known as zoning regulations) and approval of development orders that are consistent with the comprehensive plan. See F.S. ch. 163, Part II. Florida law specifically requires that the city adopt sign regulations. See F.S. § 163.3202(2)(f). Complying with state law is a compelling governmental interest. 
(3)  City comprehensive plan. The city's comprehensive plan requires that the city maintain its residential, small town, tropical character and ensure traffic safety on roads within the city through the regulation of signs, as set forth in detail below. Implementing the city comprehensive plan is a compelling governmental interest. 
a.  City comprehensive plan elements. The comprehensive plan describes Marco Island as a "small island paradise situated off the west coast of Florida, dates back to 1880." The existing land use conditions in the city are further described as follows: "a large proportion of Marco Island is either built-out or in conservation use. Approximately 52.4% of the Island's land mass is developed or situated for either residential, commercial, governmental/institutional or resort usage, with residential uses being by far predominant." Further, "A variety of commercial uses ... will be permitted that serve the needs of the residents and traveling public while maintaining the village atmosphere. Specific development criteria that encourage pedestrian and bicycle access, open view corridors of the waterfront, strengthen the historic character of the areas and identify permitted commercial uses." 
b.  City comprehensive plan goals, objectives and policies. Several goals, objectives and policies of the city's comprehensive plan require the city to maintain its tropical, small town, residential, and resort character and traffic safety through its land development regulations and actions: 
Goal: To enhance the city's quality of life, environmental quality, and tropical small town and resort character by managing growth and assuring a stable residential community with sufficient businesses to serve the needs of residents and visitors. 
Objective 1.7: The city will enforce existing and future land development regulations to eliminate and/or reduce uses of land inconsistent with the future land use map and the community's character. 
Policy 1.7.1: The city will continue to enforce adopted architectural and site design regulations in the adopted land development code. 
Policy 1.7.3: The city will seek to identify and eliminate existing non-conformities that detract from the city's character or could impact the public health, safety, or welfare through diligent code enforcement action and through attrition via approved development orders. 
Objective 1.8: The city shall coordinate future transportation, park, and infrastructure improvements to ensure compatibility and appropriateness of adjacent land uses and to promote the island's small town character. 
Goal 1: To provide and encourage a multimodal transportation system that meets the circulation needs of the city in a safe and efficient manner but does not adversely impact the quality of life of the residents. 
Objective 1.1: Promotion of a safe, convenient, and energy efficient multimodal transportation system. 
Objective 1.5: Protect and reserve existing and future rights-of-way to prevent structural encroachments and to ensure adequate ultimate roadway widths for maintenance of adopted level-of-service standards, consistent with this element, the 2020 Collier County MPO Transportation Plan and the land development code. 
Policy 1.5.1: Ensure all new construction and redevelopment projects comply with required setbacks through diligent zoning and site plan review. 
(4)  Case law. . In accordance with the U.S. Supreme Court's cases on sign regulation, the regulations in this article are not intended to regulate or censor speech based on its content or viewpoint, but rather to regulate the secondary effects of speech that may adversely affect the city's substantial and compelling governmental interests in preserving scenic beauty and community aesthetics, and in vehicular and pedestrian safety in conformance with the First Amendment. These cases and their holdings include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Reed v. Town of Gilbert , 135 S.Ct. 2218, 192 L.Ed. 2d 236 (2015) on the topic on noncommercial temporary signs; 
b.  Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego , 453 U.S. 490 (1981) on the topic of commercial signs and off premise signs; 
c.  City of Ladue v. Gilleo , 512 U.S. 43 (1994) on the topic of political protest signs in residential areas; 
d.  Linmark Assocs., Inc. v. Township of Willingboro , 431 U.S. 85 (1977) on the topic of real estate signs in residential areas; 
e.  Burson v. Freeman , 504 U.S. 191 (1992) on the topic of election signs near polling places; 
f.  Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission , 447 U.S. 557 (1980) on the topic of regulation of commercial speech; and 
g.  City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) on the topic of signs on public property. 
(5)  Impact of sign clutter. Excessive signage and sign clutter impairs the legibility of the environment, and undermines the effectiveness of governmental signs, traffic control devices and other required signs (such as nameplate sign, noncommercial onsite directional sign, identification sign, and warning and danger sign) that are essential to identifying locations for the delivery of emergency services and other compelling governmental purposes. The intent of these sign regulations is to enhance the visual environment of the city, ensure that city residents and visitors can safely navigate through the city to their intended destinations, and promote the continued well-being of the city. It is therefore the purpose of this article to promote aesthetics and the public health, safety and general welfare, and assure the adequate provision of light and air within the city through reasonable, consistent and nondiscriminatory standards for the posting, displaying, erection, use, and maintenance of signs that are no more restrictive than necessary to achieve these governmental interests. 
(6)  Specific legislative intent. More specifically, the sign regulations in this article are intended to: 
a.  Encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city; 
b.  Maintain and enhance the scenic beauty of the aesthetic environment of the island; 
c.  Maintain and improve the city's ability to preserve sources of economic development; 
d.  Ensure pedestrian and traffic safety; 
e.  Minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; 
f.  Foster the integration of signage with architectural and landscape designs; 
g.  Lessen the visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation, excessive height, and excessive area of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and are not necessary to aid in wayfinding; 
h.  Allow signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation, while precluding the placement of signs that contribute to sign clutter or that conceal or obstruct adjacent land uses or signs; 
i.  Encourage and allow signs that are appropriate to the zoning district in which they are located, consistent with and serving the needs of the land uses, activities and functions to which they pertain; 
j.  Curtail the size and number of signs to the minimum reasonably necessary to identify a residential or business location, and the nature of such use, and to allow smooth navigation to these locations; 
k.  Establish dimensional limits and placement criteria for signs that are legible and proportional to the size of the lot and building on which the sign is to be placed, or to which it pertains; 
l.  Regulate signs so that they are effective in performing the function of identifying and safely directing pedestrian and vehicular traffic to a destination; 
m.  Preclude signs from conflicting with the principal permitted use of the lot and adjoining lots; 
n.  Regulate signs in a manner so as to not interfere with, obstruct the vision of, or distract motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians; 
o.  Except to the extent expressly preempted by state or federal law, ensure that signs are constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner, and protect the public from unsafe signs; 
p.  Preserve, conserve, protect, and enhance the aesthetic quality and scenic beauty of all zoning districts of the city; 
q.  Allow for traffic control devices and government signs without regulation consistent with national standards, because they promote highway safety and efficiency by providing for the orderly movement of road users on streets and highways, and by notifying road users of regulations and providing nationally consistent warnings and guidance needed for the safe, uniform and efficient operation of all elements of the traffic stream and modes of travel, while regulating private signs to ensure that their size, location and other attributes do not impair the effectiveness of such traffic control devices; 
r.  Protect property values by precluding, to the maximum extent possible, signs that create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other properties as a result of their size, height, illumination, brightness, or movement; 
s.  Protect property values by ensuring that the size, number and appearance of signs are in harmony with buildings, neighborhoods, structures, and conforming signs in the area; 
t.  Regulate the appearance and design of signs in a manner that promotes and enhances the beautification of the city and that complements the natural surroundings in recognition of this city's reliance on its natural surroundings and beautification efforts as a source of economic advantage as an attractive place to live, work and visit; 
u.  Classify and categorize signs by type; 
v.  Not regulate signs more than necessary to accomplish the compelling and substantial governmental objectives described herein; and 
w.  Enable the fair, consistent, and rigorous enforcement of these sign regulations; 
x.  Permit, regulate and encourage the use of signs with a scale, graphic character, and type of lighting compatible with buildings and uses in the area, so as to support and complement the goals, objectives and policies set forth in the city's comprehensive plan; 
y.  Establish regulations for the design, erection and maintenance of signs for the purpose of ensuring equitable access to graphic communication, while maintaining a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing visual environment within the city, recognizing that signs form an integral part of architectural building and site design and require equal attention in their design, placement and construction; and 
z.  Be considered the maximum standards allowed for signage, and regulate signs in a permissive manner so that any sign is not allowed unless expressly permitted and not expressly prohibited. 
(c)  Nonconforming signage. 
(1)  Any previously permitted, existing sign that does not conform to the provisions of these regulations as adopted on June 18, 2018 shall be considered legal nonconforming and shall be brought into conformance with these regulations: 
a.  upon replacement after destruction by any means to such extent that the cost of rebuilding, repair or reconstruction of the sign will exceed 50 percent of the appraised value of the existing sign prior to damage; or 
b.  upon new development redevelopment of the property as defined in section 30-626, whichever occurs first. 
c.  Identification signs legally located in the public right of way, or on private property which identify businesses located on a property other than the property on which the sign is located, as of June 18, 2018 shall not be subject to the replacement requirements of (1)a. and (1)b. above. Such signs may be replaced, rebuilt, repaired or reconstructed subject to the execution of a right-of-way license agreement in a form acceptable to the city if located in the public right of way. 
(2)  If a nonconforming sign or sign face is voluntarily altered, replaced, repaired or relocated prior to the required point of compliance, any sign illumination must come into conformance at that time. 
(3)  This subsection shall be applied in a manner consistent with F.S. § 70.20. 
(d)  Substitution of noncommercial speech for commercial speech. Notwithstanding any provisions of this article to the contrary, to the extent that this article permits a sign containing commercial copy, it shall permit a noncommercial sign to the same extent. The noncommercial message may occupy the entire sign area or any portion thereof, and may substitute for or be combined with the commercial message. The sign message may be changed from commercial to noncommercial or from one noncommercial message to another, as frequently as desired by the sign's owner, provided that the sign is not prohibited and the sign continues to comply with all requirements of this article. 
(e)  Severability. 
(1)  Generally. Generally, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this article is declared unconstitutional by the final and valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term or word of this article. 
(2)  Severability where less speech results. This section shall not be interpreted to limit the effect of subsection (d)(1) or any other applicable severability provision in this Code or adopting ordinance. The city council specifically intends that severability shall be applied to these sign regulations even if the result would be to allow less speech, whether by subjecting currently exempt signs to permitting or by some other means. 
(3)  Severability of provisions pertaining to prohibited signs. This section shall not be interpreted to limit the effect of subsection (d)(1), or any severability provision in this Code or any adopting ordinance. The city council specifically intends that severability shall be applied to section 30-529 concerning prohibited signs so that each of the prohibited sign types listed in that section shall continue to be prohibited irrespective of whether another sign prohibition is declared unconstitutional or invalid. 
(4)  Severability of prohibition on billboard off-premises signs. This section shall not be interpreted to limit the effect of subsection (d)(1) above, or any other applicable severability provision in this Code or any adopting ordinance. If any or all of article VI signage or other provision of this Code is declared unconstitutional or invalid by the final and valid judgment of competent jurisdiction, the city council specifically intends that the declaration shall not affect the prohibition on billboard off-premises signs contained herein in section 30-529. 
(Ord. No. 18-11 , § 4, 6-18-2018) 
Sec. 30-522. - Sign permits.

Upon the submission of an application, the city shall have ten business days to determine whether it is complete. If the city finds that the application is not complete, the city shall provide the applicant with written notice of the deficiencies within the ten-day period. Upon resubmission of the application, the city shall have five additional business days to determine whether the applicant's revisions are sufficient to complete the application. If they are not, the city will again inform the applicant of any remaining deficiencies in writing. This process shall continue until the applicant has submitted a complete application, or demands that the application be reviewed "as is." 
(2)  Unified sign plan application. When requested or required, an application for a unified sign plan, in the form provided by the city, signed by owners of all property subject to the proposed unified sign plan may be submitted. Such application shall be processed pursuant to the sign permit process of this section.

(b)  Signs exempt from permitting. The following signs are exempt from the permit requirements of this code, and shall be allowed in all districts subject to the limitations set forth below. However, this exemption in no way waives the requirements of the Florida Building Code or the city's adopted engineering standards, any limitation or restriction on the number, size, height, setback, placement or duration of such signs under this article, or any limitation or restriction under any other applicable law or regulation. 
(1)  Signs, not exceeding four square feet in area, which facilitate the movement of pedestrians and vehicles within the site upon which such signs are posted.

i.  Set back at least ten feet from the edge of the pavement of any adjacent public street; and 
ii.  If a sidewalk is present, such sign shall be setback five feet from the sidewalk. 
3.  Signs may be located either parallel to or perpendicular to the adjacent right-of-way. 
(11)  Signs required to be maintained or posted by law or governmental order, rule, or regulation. 
(12)  Municipal, county, state or federal signs, legal notices, danger signs and such temporary emergency signs when erected by an appropriate authority. 
(13)  To the extent that this subsection allows a sign displaying commercial content to be exempt from permitting, it shall allow a sign with the same size, length of display, appearance, location, display area, and other physical characteristics to be exempt from permitting if it displays noncommercial content. 
(c)  Variances. It is recognized that the regulations provided herein cannot address all situations pertaining to signs. Administrative variances to section 30-526(a)(2)a. or 30-526(h)(2)d. may be approved by the director. Variances to the size, height, maximum number of, and other minimum setback requirements for signs may be granted by the zoning board of appeals. 
(1)  Application procedure. A written application for a sign variance, in the form provided by the city, shall be filed, together with a complete sign application and shall include a detailed description of the variance request and such drawings and specifications as may be necessary to fully advise the city of the type and degree of variance from the code requirements requested. Upon the submission of an application, the city shall have ten business days to determine whether it is complete. If the city finds that the application is not complete, the city shall provide the applicant with written notice of the deficiencies within the ten-day period. Upon resubmission of the application, the city shall have five additional business days to determine whether the applicant's revisions are sufficient to complete the application. If they are not, the city will again inform the applicant of any remaining deficiencies in writing. This process shall continue until the applicant has submitted a complete application, or demands that the application be reviewed "as is." 
(2)  Administrative variances. An applicant may, in conjunction with a sign permit, with submission of the administrative variance fee, request an administrative variance for consideration of a variance to: 
a.  Section 30-526(a)(2)a. requiring a 15-foot setback requirement for freestanding signs in a commercial district, provided in no event shall an approved setback be less than five feet. 
1.  The director shall review and either approve, approve with conditions, or deny the administrative variance at the same time the sign permit is approved or denied. The director may grant an administrative variance to the required 15-foot setback only: 
i.  Where due to the existing site conditions and improvements, it can be demonstrated that adherence to the required 15-foot setback will have a deleterious effect on the safety of users of the site from the perspective of vehicular parking and vehicular and pedestrian ingress and egress; or 
ii.  Where due to the nature and location of existing landscape features and/or specimen trees, it would be prudent to allow for a reduction in the required setback so as to most appropriately locate the sign structure; and 
iii.  To the extent the reduction is the minimum amount necessary to provide relief from the applicable conditions cited above. 
2.  As a condition of such approval, the director may require a reduction in sign height and/or size. 
b.  Section 30-526(h)(2)d. limiting illumination to ten or two footcandles, provided in no event shall the administrative variance relief granted exceed ten percent of the allowable foot-candle standard. 
1.  The director shall review and either approve, approve with conditions, or deny the administrative variance at the same time the sign permit is approved or denied. The director may grant an administrative variance to the illumination standards only under one of the following circumstances: 
i.  Where due to the nature and location of existing landscaping features and/or specimen trees, it would be prudent to allow for an increase in the maximum illumination; or 
ii.  Where the sign owner has demonstrated a good-faith effort to obtain compliance, but due to factors inherent to the sign components and/or materials, full compliance cannot be achieved without substantial additional costs; or 
iii.  Where the signage in question is part of an approved unified sign plan, whereby the intended uniformity or harmony of the sign plan cannot be achieved without variance relief to the maximum illumination standards; or 
iv.  In cases where such variance relief to the maximum illumination standard(s) will not create on- or off-site impacts to pedestrians or to vehicular traffic. 
2.  As a condition of such approval, the director may impose additional landscape or other shielding requirements. 
(3)  Other sign variances. The city council is empowered to grant variances to the size, height, maximum number of, and other minimum setback requirements for signs to permit the erection of signs not in strict conformity with this chapter as provided below: 
a.  Application review. The city council shall hold a public hearing at the next available council meeting that is at least 25 days after the date of receiving the completed variance application, at which the council shall determine whether the application satisfies the criteria of this section. 
b.  Notice of city council public hearing. Notice of public hearing before the city council is given at least 15 calendar days in advance of the public hearing. The owner of the property for which variance is sought, or his agent or attorney designated by him on his petition, shall be notified by mail. Notice of the public hearing shall be prominently posted on the property for which the variance is sought and shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least one time 15 calendar days prior to the hearing. 
c.  Approval criteria. The city council shall approve, by resolution, or deny a petition for a sign variance upon consideration and weighing of the following standards: 
1.  Are there special conditions and circumstances existing which are peculiar to the location, size and characteristics of the land, structure, building or sign involved. 
2.  Are there special conditions and circumstances which do not result from the action of the applicant such as pre-existing conditions relative to the property which is the subject of the variance request. 
3.  Will a literal interpretation of the provisions of this zoning code work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant or create practical difficulties on the applicant. 
4.  Will the variance, if granted, be the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable placement or use of the sign to promote standards of health, safety or welfare. 
5.  Will granting the variance requested confer on the petitioner any special privilege that is denied by these zoning regulations to other lands, buildings, structures or signs in the same zoning district. 
6.  Will granting the variance be in harmony with the intent and purpose of this zoning code, and not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
7.  Are there natural conditions or physically induced conditions that ameliorate the goals and objectives of the regulation such as natural preserves, lakes, golf course, etc. 
8.  Will granting the variance be consistent with the growth management plan. 
d.  Conditions and safeguards. In approving any variance, the city council may impose appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this zoning code including, but not limited to, reasonable time limits within which the action for which the variance is required shall be begun or completed, or both. In the case of after-the-fact variances, the council may impose, as a condition of approval, that in the case of the destruction of the sign structure, for any reason, to an extent equal to or greater than 50 percent of the actual replacement cost of the structure at the time of its destruction, any reconstruction shall conform to the provisions of this Code in effect at the time of reconstruction. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this zoning code. 
e.  If the city council does not approve the application, the city shall prepare a written notice of its decision, describing the applicant's appeal rights, and send it by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the applicant. Upon denial of a sign variance application the applicant may seek relief in the circuit court for the county, as provided by law.

ARTICLE VII. - SUBDIVISION STANDARDS 

Sec. 30-571. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is the intent of this article to provide for minimum standards regulating subdivisions. Such standards are necessary for the protection of the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city. It is further the purpose of this article to ensure that future subdivision activities conform with, and comply with all applicable codes and ordinances, including the comprehensive plan, of the city. 
(Ord. No. 02-14, § 1, 3-4-2002) 
Sec. 30-572. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them as set forth in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alley means a roadway dedicated to public use which affords only a secondary means of access to abutting property and is not intended for general traffic circulation. 
    Arterial street means a street that provides a high degree of mobility. Arterials connect major developments such as business districts, commercial centers, and residential communities. The average daily two-way trip generation rate exceeds 4,000 vehicle trips per day. 
    Collector street means a street that provides land access and public or private movement within residential, commercial and industrial areas. Collectors penetrate, but should not have continuity through, residential areas. Operating speeds and volumes are low. The average daily two-way trip generation rate ranges from 2,000 to 4,000 vehicle trips per day. 
    Local street means a street that provides land access, and can be local residential streets, local downtown streets, and local commercial/industrial streets. Local streets involve traveling to and from collector facilities. Trip lengths are short, volumes are low and speeds are low. The average daily two-way trip generation rate ranges from zero to 2,000 vehicle trips per day. 
    Private road means an approved road owned and maintained by the abutting property owners, and recorded on the final subdivision plat or other public records. 
    Subdivision means the division of a parcel of land into three or more parcels of land, for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of transferring ownership, or, if the establishment of a new street is involved, any division of a parcel of land. The term "subdivision" includes a resubdivision, and, when appropriate to the context, shall relate to the process of subdividing or to the land subdivided. 
    Vehicular access easement, under limited circumstances, means a strip of land by which safe ingress/egress can be accommodated over and across residential zoned property(ies) to provide vehicular access to up to four residentially zoned lots. Said vehicular access easement shall meet minimum standards of the city, and shall include appropriate pavement improvements for motor vehicle use, or a financial guarantee of completion posted with the city, prior to the issuance of any building permits for the lots served by the access easement. Said easement shall be recorded in the public records upon administrative review and approval by city staff. 
    Circumstances under which a vehicular access easement may be appropriate: 
(1)  To serve lots of record that were originally platted with street frontage, but due to the Deltona Settlement Agreement, the street providing access cannot be constructed. 
(2)  Where due to environmental constraints (e.g., wetlands, habitats, etc.) a vehicular access easement would be less impactive then a new public or private street. 
(Ord. No. 02-14, § 2, 3-4-2002) 
Sec. 30-573. - General requirements. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to create a subdivision of, or to subdivide, or to otherwise divide, any land in the city, except in strict conformance with the provisions of this article and any applicable provisions of the comprehensive plan and the land development code. 
(b)  No land shall be divided or subdivided, nor shall any subdivision occur or be created, platted, recorded or left unrecorded, nor shall any building permit for any structure to be constructed upon any land so subdivided be issued, unless such subdivision meets all of the provisions of this article, the land development code, and all of the provisions of any applicable federal, state and local laws, including the comprehensive plan. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful for any person to transfer, sell, or otherwise convey, to sell any land by reference to, exhibition of, or other use of, a plat of a subdivision of such land without having submitted a final subdivision plat of such land for approval to city council as required by this article and without having recorded the approved final subdivision plat as required in this article. 
(d)  No approval of the final subdivision plat, improvement plans or authorization to proceed with construction activities in compliance with the same shall require the city to issue a development order or building permit if: 
(1)  It can be shown that issuance of said development order or building permit will result in a reduction in the level of service for any public facility below the level of service established in the city comprehensive plan; or 
(2)  Issuance of said development order or building permit is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this article, all subdivision and development shall comply with city ordinances regarding adequate public facilities. 
(Ord. No. 02-14, § 3, 3-4-2002) 
Sec. 30-574. - Exemptions. 
    The following shall be considered exempt from the subdivision procedures as outlined in this article. However, such exemptions shall be reviewed and stamped "exempt" by the community development department prior to recordation of any documents related to the exempt subdivision. 
(1)  The creation of two lots from one recorded lot of record if said lots created meet or exceed the minimum dimensional standards of the underlying zoning district, and all resultant lots have direct access to an existing public or private street.

ARTICLE VIII. - ARCHITECTURAL AND SITE DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 30-621. - Intent and purpose. 
    The purpose of these architectural and site design regulations is to supplement existing development criteria with specific criteria that apply to the design of all new construction, redevelopment and renovation of commercial buildings and projects. The goal is to create and maintain a positive community image and identity by providing for architectural and site design treatments which will: 
(1)  Enhance the visual appearance and character of the community; 
(2)  Increase the safety and convenience of commercial and mixed use projects on Marco Island; 
(3)  Provide incentives for development and redevelopment that is directed towards supporting pedestrian and bicycle access and interconnectivity of sites; and 
(4)  Enhance the quality of life on Marco Island. 
The purpose of building design is to maintain and enhance the attractiveness of the streetscape and the existing architectural design of the community. Buildings shall have architectural features and patterns that provide visual interest from the perspective of the pedestrian; reduce massing; recognize local character; and are site responsive. Corporate chain building designs and prototype/generic architectural designs not specifically designed for the city and for the individual characteristics of the site and architectural overlay district shall not be allowed. Facades shall be designed to reduce the mass/scale and uniform monolithic appearance of large unadorned walls, while providing visual interest that will be consistent with the community's identity and character through the use of detail and scale. Articulation is accomplished by varying the buildings mass in height and width so that it appears to be divided into distinct massing elements and details that can be perceived at the scale of the pedestrian/motorist. 
(Ord. No. 02-06, § 1, 1-22-2002) 
Sec. 30-622. - Applicability. 
    Provisions of this article are applicable in all commercial zoning districts, commercial overlay districts, commercial components of planned unit development (PUD) districts, developments of regional impacts (DRIs), public use districts and community facility districts. All new development, redevelopment, and renovations shall adhere to the appropriate architectural overlay district styles, zoning district regulations, and site design guidelines incorporated within this article. Compliance with the standards set forth in this article shall be demonstrated by submittal of architectural drawings in accordance with this article, a landscape plan in accordance with the LDC, and a site development plan or site improvement plan in accordance with article IX. Deviations from these regulations may be authorized when: 
(1)  The community development director or designee determines specific regulations or requirements are in conflict with the city's building code or life/safety code; 
(2)  The planning board determines that costs associated with rigid compliance will create an economic hardship on the owner and render the project prohibitive. A creative and innovative solution shall be demonstrated to the planning board prior to allowing any departure from these regulations for hardship cases. 
(Ord. No. 02-06, § 2, 1-22-2002) 
Sec. 30-623. - Design review. 
(a)  All new construction, redevelopment and renovations of commercial buildings and projects shall be reviewed by the city staff for compliance with the regulations contained in this article. An immediate appeal may be brought to the city planning board for cases that cannot be resolved at staff level. Staff shall describe the areas of concern, inconsistencies, and/or departure(s) from this article. 
(b)  Reserved. 
(c)  Maximum impervious surface ratios. The maximum impervious surface ratio shall be 76 percent for new commercial development/redevelopment occurring on conforming commercial lots of record. However, this maximum may be increased in cases where the new commercial development/redevelopment incorporates features and/or amenities that advance other adopted policies, or which promote thoughtful, innovation site design and planning. In no event shall the impervious surface ratio exceed 95 percent. Examples of situations where an increase can be granted administratively include: 
(1)  Where the impervious surface ratio would result in a decrease of existing parking facilities on properties seeking to redevelop and/or renovate. 
(2)  Where interconnections between existing and/or future parking facilities are provided or shown on the approved site development plan. 
(3)  When enhanced pedestrian facilities and connections are provided. 
(4)  Where below ground water management facilities are provided or incorporated into the approved site development plan. 
(5)  Where structures located on in-fill lots are attached to adjacent structures, and side yards are eliminated. 
(6)  Where decorative plazas, fountains, or other impervious, aesthetic features are provided. 
(7)  Where improved access is required for life safety purposes. 
(8)  Where innovative parking programs are involved. 
(9)  Where the proposed development incorporates enhancements to adjoining properties or the public right-of-way. 
(d)  Mixed use ratios. The commercial, residential, and useable open space components of mixed use developments shall be consistent with the provisions of the underlying zoning district and comprehensive plan.

Sec. 30-711. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish a management and monitoring system to evaluate and coordinate the timing and provision of necessary public facilities to service development pursuant to adopted LOS (level of service) standards, to establish a regulatory program that ensures that adequate public facilities are available to serve development concurrent with when the impacts of development occur on the public facilities. 
(Ord. No. 02-09, § 1, 2-19-2002) 
Sec. 30-712. - Conditions for concurrency. 
    Required facilities include any improvement or public facility which is required to maintain the prescribed LOS parameters to serve current city residents and projected new residents as a result of a given project. Required facilities for a proposed development shall be identified by the owner or developer and reviewed for concurrency by the city in compliance with the adopted comprehensive plan. Concurrency requirements for a proposed project will be met if any of the following three conditions are met for each of the level of service requirements for required facilities: 
(1)  Condition 1: Required facilities are in place at the time a development order is issued, or a development order is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities will be in place when the certificate of occupancy is issued. 
(2)  Condition 2: The required facilities are under construction at the time a development order is issued. 
(3)  Condition 3: The required facilities are the subject of a binding contract executed for the construction of those facilities at the time a development order is issued. 
    Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, with respect to potable water, the sole condition will be the city's determination as to whether potable water supplied to serve the new development will be available no later than the anticipated date of issuance by the city of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent.

(3)  Current capital improvements program and potential capital improvements program options for maintaining level of service with a five-year timeframe; 
(4)  Available or potential funding sources; 
(5)  Current population and five-year projection, by year; 
(6)  Comparison of previous year's building permit activity to past five years' inventory. 
(7)  Potential developments, redevelopments or annexations which could have an impact on the current level of service; and 
(8)  Relationship to the goals, objective and policies on the comprehensive plan. 
(c)  Based on the advise of the public works director, the following actions may be initiated to ensure continued compliance: 
(1)  If the current level of service for transportation facilities is measured at the adopted level of service or better, no mitigating action is required. 
(2)  If the current level of service measured is nearing the next lower level of service, quarterly counts will be taken and analyzed for a peak hour/peak season count. If necessary, a detailed study of the capacity of the roadway segment, consistent with the 2000 (or the most current edition) DOT Highway Capacity Manual Data, will be undertaken concurrently with the collection of quarterly data. 
(3)  If the current level of service measured is at the next lower level of service, and had been at the adopted level of service the previous year, quarterly counts will be taken and analyzed for a peak hour/peak season count. 
(4)  If three consecutive quarterly counts, which may include the annual count, indicate that the roadway to be below the adopted level of service, then the roadway segment enters a transitional period at the beginning of the next fiscal year. During this period, the roadway may operate on one level below the adopted level of service for two years. Development orders may still be issued, provided that the improvements necessary to elevate the level of service have been planned, funded and adopted as part of the first two-year period of the capital improvements program. Construction for these improvements, including parallel facilities or improvements, must begin in or before the second year of the transition period. 
(5)  No development orders negatively impacting the affected segment shall be issued until improvements are made to the existing roadway, or a parallel facility is constructed or improved to capture traffic from the affected segment. 
(6)  If the measured level of service is at "F," the city shall cease issuing development orders that would serve to increase the volume of traffic on the affected segment. 
(7)  A comprehensive plan amendment is required to change the level of service for any road segment, or defer or delay construction, beyond the two-year transitional period, which is necessary to maintain or reestablish an adopted level of service.

(Ord. No. 02-09, § 11, 2-19-2002) 
DIVISION 2. - TRANSPORTATION PROPORTIONATE FAIR-SHARE 

Sec. 30-722. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the proportionate fair-share program, as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16). 
(Ord. No. 07-02, § 1, 1-22-2007) 
Sec. 30-723. - Applicability. 
    The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to all developments in the City of Marco Island that have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on a transportation facility in the city concurrency management system, including transportation facilities maintained by FDOT or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency determinations. The proportionate fair-share program does not apply to developments of regional impact (DRIs) using proportionate fair-share under F.S. § 163.3180(12), or to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in F.S. § 163.3180, regarding exceptions and de minimis impacts. 
(Ord. No. 07-02, § 1, 1-22-2007) 
Sec. 30-724. - General requirements. 
(a)  An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the City of Marco Island by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
(1)  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations. 
(2)  The five-year schedule of capital improvements in the City of Marco Island CIE or the long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS includes a transportation improvement(s) that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of the City of Marco Island transportation CMS. The provisions of subsection (b) may apply if a project or projects needed to satisfy concurrency are not presently contained within the local government CIE or an adopted long-term schedule of capital improvements. 
(b)  The City of Marco Island may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program by contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of the City of Marco Island transportation CMS, but is not contained in the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE or a long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS, where the following apply: 
(1)  The City of Marco Island adopts, by resolution or ordinance, a commitment to add the improvement to the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE or long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS no later than the next regularly scheduled update. To qualify for consideration under this section, the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the city manager or designee, and determined to be financially feasible pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(b)1, consistent with the comprehensive plan, and in compliance with the provisions of this article. Financial feasibility for this section means that additional contributions, payments or funding sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten years to fully mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities. 
(2)  If the funds allocated for the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the City of Marco Island CIE are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the CMS, the City of Marco Island may still enter into a binding proportionate fair-share agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair-share is calculated if the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will, in the opinion of the governmental entity or entities maintaining the transportation facilities, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. 
The improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fair-share component must be adopted into the five-year capital improvements schedule of the comprehensive plan or the long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term concurrency management system at the next annual capital improvements element update. 
(c)  Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share obligation must meet design standards of the City of Marco Island for locally maintained roadways and those of the FDOT for the state highway system. 
(Ord. No. 07-02, § 1, 1-22-2007) 
Sec 30-725. - Intergovernmental coordination. 
    Pursuant to policies in the Intergovernmental Coordination Element of the City of Marco Island comprehensive plan and applicable policies in the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council Regional Plan, the City of Marco Island shall coordinate with affected jurisdictions, including Collier County and FDOT, regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under the jurisdiction of the local government receiving the application for proportionate fair-share mitigation. An interlocal agreement may be established with other affected jurisdictions for this purpose. 
(Ord. No. 07-02, § 1, 1-22-2007) 
Sec. 30-726. - Application process. 
(a)  Upon notification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, the applicant shall also be notified in writing of the opportunity to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program pursuant to the requirements of section 30-724. 
(b)  Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, a pre-application meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and related issues. If the impacted facility is on the SIS, then the FDOT and Collier County will be notified and invited to participate in the preapplication meeting. 
(c)  Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the City of Marco Island that includes any application fee as may be included in the city's schedule of fees and the following: 
(1)  Name, address and phone number of owner(s), developer and agent; 
(2)  Property location, including parcel identification numbers; 
(3)  Legal description and survey of property; 
(4)  Project description, including type, intensity, and amount of development; 
(5)  Phasing schedule, if applicable; 
(6)  Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation method(s); and 
(7)  Copy of concurrency application. 
(d)  The city manager or designee shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient and complete. If an application is determined to be insufficient, incomplete, or inconsistent with the general requirements of the proportionate fair-share program as indicated in section 30-724, then the applicant will be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the written notification, then the application will be deemed abandoned. The Marco Island City Council may, in its discretion, grant an extension of time not to exceed 60 days to cure such deficiencies, provided that the applicant has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure. 
(e)  Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the SIS requires the concurrency of the FDOT. The applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and the FDOT for inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(f)  When an application is deemed sufficient, complete, and eligible, the applicant shall be advised in writing and a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the City of Marco Island or the applicant with direction from the City of Marco Island and delivered to the appropriate parties for review, including a copy to the FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on a SIS facility, no later than 60 days from the date at which the applicant received the notification of a sufficient application and no fewer than 30 days prior to the city council meeting when the agreement will be considered. 
(g)  The City of Marco Island shall notify the applicant regarding the date of the city council meeting when the agreement will be considered for final approval. No proportionate fair-share agreement will be effective until approved by the Marco Island City Council. 
(Ord. No. 07-02, § 1, 1-22-2007) 
Sec. 30-727. - Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(a)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
(b)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
(c)  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows: 
"The cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS." 
OR 
Proportionate Fair-Share = s[[(Development Trips;sub \sub;) / (SV Increase;sub \sub;)] × Cost;sub \sub;] 
Where: 
Development Trips;sub \sub; = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per the CMS; 
SV Increase;sub \sub; = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i" per section 30-724; 
Cost;sub \sub; = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred. 
(d)  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the City of Marco Island shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the CIE, the MPO/TIP or the FDOT work program. Where such information is not available, improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods: 
(1)  An analysis by the City of Marco Island of costs by cross section type that incorporates data from recent projects and is updated annually and approved by the city council. In order to accommodate increases in construction material costs, project costs shall be adjusted by an inflation factor; or 
(2)  The most recent issue of FDOT transportation costs, as adjusted based upon the type of cross section (urban or rural); locally available data from recent projects on acquisition, drainage and utility costs; and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. Cost estimates for state road improvements not included in the adopted FDOT work program shall be determined using this method in coordination with the FDOT district. 
(e)  If the City of Marco Island has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section. 
(f)  If the City of Marco Island has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non site-related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value by the Collier County Property Appraiser or, at the option of the applicant, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the City of Marco Island and at no expense to the City of Marco Island. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the City of Marco Island at no expense to the City of Marco Island. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the City of Marco Island estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. Prior to purchase or acquisition of any real estate or acceptance of donations of real estate intended to be used for the proportionate fair-share, public or private partners should contact the FDOT for essential information about compliance with federal law and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 07-02, § 1, 1-22-2007) 
Sec. 30-728. - Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(a)  Proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees to the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by Collier County's Impact Fee Ordinance. 
(b)  Impact fee credits for the proportionate fair-share contribution will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development. Impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced per the proportionate fair-share agreement as they become due per the City of Marco Island Impact Fee Ordinance. If the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation is less than the development's anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review, then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount to the Collier County pursuant to the requirements of the Collier County Impact Fee Ordinance. 
(c)  Major projects not included within Collier County's Impact Fee Ordinance or created under subsection 30-724(b)(1) and (2) which can demonstrate a significant benefit to the impacted transportation system may be eligible at the Collier County's discretion for impact fee credits. 
(d)  The proportionate fair-share obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed development at a specific location. As a result, any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other location unless provided for within Collier County's Impact Fee Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 07-02, § 1, 1-22-2007) 
Sec. 30-729. - Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(a)  Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement (agreement) the applicant shall receive a city certificate of concurrency approval. Should the applicant fail to apply for a development permit within 12 months or timeframe provided in the local CMS of the execution of the agreement, then the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to reapply. 
(b)  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be nonrefundable. If the payment is submitted more than 12 months from the date of execution of the agreement, then the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment, pursuant to section 30-727 and adjusted accordingly. 
(c)  All developer improvements authorized under this article must be completed prior to issuance of a development permit, or as otherwise established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. It is the intent of this section that any required improvements be completed before issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy. 
(d)  Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fair-share agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat. 
(e)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order may be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
(f)  Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising costs to the City of Marco Island will be nonrefundable. 
(g)  The City of Marco Island may enter into proportionate fair-share agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility. 
(Ord. No. 07-02, § 1, 1-22-2007) 
Sec. 30-730. - Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(a)  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the City of Marco Island CIE, or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. At the discretion of the local government, proportionate fair-share revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the capacity project from which the proportionate fair-share revenues were derived. Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the 50 percent local match for funding under the FDOT TRIP. 
(b)  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIE, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor or sector that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of subsection 30-724(b)(2). 
    Where an impacted regional facility has been designated as a regionally significant transportation facility in an adopted regional transportation plan as provided in F.S. § 339.155, and then the City of Marco Island may coordinate with other impacted jurisdictions and agencies to apply proportionate fair-share contributions and public contributions to seek funding for improving the impacted regional facility under the FDOT TRIP. Such coordination shall be ratified by the City of Marco Island through an interlocal agreement that establishes a procedure for earmarking of the developer contributions for this purpose. 
(c)  Where an applicant constructs a transportation facility that exceeds the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation calculated under section 30-728, the City of Marco Island shall reimburse the applicant for the excess contribution using one or more of the following methods: 
(1)  An impact fee credit account may be established for the applicant in the amount of the excess contribution, a portion or all of which may be assigned and reassigned under the terms and conditions acceptable to the City of Marco Island. 
(2)  An account may be established for the applicant for the purpose of reimbursing the applicant for the excess contribution with proportionate fair-share payments from future applicants on the facility. 
(3)  The City of Marco Island may compensate the applicant for the excess contribution through payment or some combination of means acceptable to the City of Marco Island and the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 07-02, § 1, 1-22-2007) 
Sec. 30-731. - Optional provisions. 
(a)  Cross jurisdictional impacts. 
(1)  In the interest of intergovernmental coordination and to reflect the shared responsibilities for managing development and concurrency, the City of Marco Island may enter an agreement with Collier County or the Florida Department of Transportation to address cross jurisdictional impacts of development on regional transportation facilities. The agreement shall provide for application of the methodology in this section to address the cross jurisdictional transportation impacts of development. This article may be amended as necessary in the future to reflect any such agreements. 
(2)  A development application submitted to the City of Marco Island subject to a transportation concurrency determination meeting all of the following criteria shall be subject to this section: 
a.  All or part of the proposed development is located within one mile of the area which is under the jurisdiction, for transportation concurrency, of Collier County or the Florida Department of Transportation; and 
b.  Using its own concurrency analysis procedures, the City of Marco Island concludes that the additional traffic from the proposed development would use five percent or more of the adopted peak hour level of service maximum service volume of a regional transportation facility within the concurrency jurisdiction of Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation ("impacted regional facility"); and 
c.  The impacted regional facility is projected to be operating below the level of service standard, adopted by Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation, when the traffic from the proposed development is included. 
(3)  Upon identification of an impacted regional facility pursuant to subsections (a)(2)a.-c., the City of Marco Island shall notify the applicant and Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation in writing of the opportunity to derive an additional proportionate fair-share contribution, based on the projected impacts of the proposed development on the impacted adjacent facility. 
a.  Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation shall have up to 90 days in which to notify the City of Marco Island of a proposed specific proportionate fair-share obligation, and the intended use of the funds when received. Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation must provide reasonable justification that both the amount of the payment and its intended use comply with the requirements of F.S. § 163.3180(16). Should Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation decline proportionate fair-share mitigation under this section, then the provisions of this section would not apply and the applicant would be subject only to the proportionate fair-share requirements of the City of Marco Island. 
b.  If the subject application is subsequently approved by the City of Marco Island, the approval shall include a condition that the applicant provides, prior to the issuance of any building permit covered by that application, evidence that the proportionate fair-share obligation to Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation has been satisfied. The City of Marco Island may require Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation to declare, in a resolution, ordinance, or equivalent document, its intent for the use of the concurrency funds to be paid by the applicant. 
(4)  Proportionate share program for TCEAs, TCMAs, and MMTDs. Within the any local TCMAs, and/or MMTDs, and/or TCEAs, the City of Marco Island hereby establishes a proportionate fair-share assessment, based on the expected costs and transportation benefits of all the programmed improvements within that district, and based on the expected trip generation of the proposed development. 
(Ord. No. 07-02, § 1, 1-22-2007) 
Sec. 30-732. - Method for cost escalation. 
    This section contains a method to estimate growth in costs, through the computation of a three-year average of the actual cost growth rates. This will provide a growth rate that should be smoothed to avoid overcompensating for major fluctuations in costs that have occurred due to short term material shortages. 
Cost n = Cost 0 × (1 + Cost_growth 3yr ) n 
Where: 
Cost n = The cost of the improvements in year n; 
Cost 0 = The cost of the improvement in the current year; 
Cost_growth 3yr = The growth rate of costs over the last three years; 
n = The number of years until the improvement is constructed. 
The three-year growth rate is determined by the following formula: 
Cost_growth 3yr = [Cost_growth -1 + Cost_growth -2 + Cost_growth -3 ]/3 
Where: 
Cost_growth 3yr = The growth rate of costs over the last three years; 
Cost_growth -1 = The growth rate of costs in the previous year; 
Cost_growth -2 = The growth rate of costs two years prior; 
Cost_growth -3 = The growth rate of costs three years prior.

ARTICLE XI. - COASTAL CONSTRUCTION SETBACK LINE VARIANCE 

Sec. 30-751. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to ensure that construction activities desired to occur beyond the established coastal construction setback line are thoroughly reviewed and permitted in accordance with the regulations contained herein. The intent of the article is to limit approval of variances related to coastal construction activities to those found consistent with the provisions of this article and the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 02-03, § 1, 1-7-2002) 
Sec. 30-752. - Title and citation. 
    This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Coastal Construction Setback Line Variance Regulations." 
(Ord. No. 02-03, § 2, 1-7-2002) 
Sec. 30-753. - Establishment of setback lines. 
(a)  The coastal construction setback line shall be that coastal construction setback line established by the department of natural resources of the state pursuant to F.S. § 161.053 and recorded in Coastal Setback Line Book 1, pages 1 through 12 inclusive, recorded October 31, 1974, as Clerk's Instrument No. 365665 of the public records of Collier County, Florida. 
(b)  Setback lines established under this article shall be reviewed upon petition of affected riparian upland owners. The city board of zoning appeals shall decide, after due public notice and hearing, whether a change in the setback line is justified, and shall notify the petitioner in writing. The present setback lines are presumed to be correct, and no change in setback lines shall be made except upon an affirmation showing by petitioner that any construction line established hereunder is a minimum of 150 feet landward of the mean high-water line or 75 feet landward of the vegetation line whichever is greater; and that the general public health, safety and welfare is preserved, upland properties protected, and beach and sand dune erosion controlled.

(e)  Issuance of permit. Upon presentation of the completed application, proof of insurance, payment of permit fee, surety bond or cash payment in lieu of the bond and review by the community development director, the permit may be issued. If the community development director determines that the use of public or private property could affect the public's use of the property, or have potential adverse impacts on surrounding properties, than he may require that the permit application be scheduled for a public hearing before the city council.

The notice for the public hearing shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation at least one time 15 days prior to the hearing. 
(f)  Suspension of permit. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the temporary use permit once issued shall be grounds for immediate suspension of the permitted activity until such time as the noncompliance is remedied. The suspension shall be initially communicated orally, followed by a written suspension order; and continued failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit may result in revocation of the permit. 
(g)  Costs for extraordinary services. The city shall recover direct costs for extraordinary services rendered in connection with a production. Such costs shall include, but not limited to, charges for personnel and/or equipment committed in support of the production which are outside the normal scope of government services. Based on the information contained in the permit application, an estimate of these costs will be provided to the applicant prior to issuance of this permit. The city may require prepayment of all or a portion of these estimated costs prior to issuance of the permit. At the conclusion of the production, actual costs below or in excess of the estimates will be refunded by the city or paid by the applicant, respectively. 
(h)  Surety bond. A surety bond in the amount to be determined by the city will be required by a company authorized to issue bonds in the state or cash payment in lieu of the bond to provide for cleanup and/or restoration of the subject site(s).

Sec. 30-854. - Findings. 
    It is hereby ascertained, determined and declared: 
(1)  Future growth represented by fire/rescue services impact development should contribute its fair share to the cost of improvements and additions to the fire/rescue services system that are required to accommodate the use of such facilities by growth. 
(2)  Implementation of the impact fee to require future fire/rescue services impact development to contribute its fair share of the cost of improvements and additions to the fire/rescue services system is an integral and vital element of the regulatory plan of growth management. 
(3)  The standard of service for the fire/rescue services system, as determined in the impact fee study, is hereby approved and adopted by the city. 
(4)  Capital planning is an evolving process and the standard of service for the fire/rescue services system constitutes a projection of anticipated need for fire equipment and facilities, based upon present knowledge and judgment. Therefore, in recognition of changing growth patterns and the dynamic nature of population growth, it is the intent of the city council that the standard of service for the fire/rescue services system and the impact fee imposed be reviewed and adjusted periodically, to ensure that the fire/rescue services impact fees are imposed equitably and lawfully, based upon actual and anticipated growth at the time of their imposition. 
(5)  The imposition of the fire/rescue services impact fee is to provide a source of revenue to fund the development or improvement of the fire/rescue services system necessitated by growth. 
(6)  The city council specifically finds that fire/rescue services benefit all residents of the city and, therefore, the fire/rescue services impact fee shall be imposed in all areas of the city. 
(7)  This article shall not be construed to permit the collection of impact fees from fire/rescue services impact development in excess of the amount reasonably anticipated to offset the demand on the fire/rescue services system generated by the fire/rescue services impact development occurring subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this division derives. 
(8)  Improvements and additions to the fire/rescue services system needed to eliminate any deficiency between the existing fire/rescue services system and the standard of service utilized in the adopted impact fee study, as amended and supplemented, shall be funded by revenues other than impact fees. Therefore, the revenue derived from the impact fee shall be utilized only for the acquisition of improvements and additions to the fire/rescue services system, which are necessitated by fire/rescue services impact development occurring subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this division derives. 
(Ord. No. 02-17, § 4, 5-6-2002) 
Sec. 30-855. - Adoption of impact fee study. 
    The city council hereby adopts and incorporates by reference the fire/rescue services impact fee rate study, dated April 8, 2002 and any amendments, updates, or supplements thereto particularly the assumptions, conclusions and findings in such study and its amendments as to the determination of anticipated costs of additions to the fire/rescue services system required to accommodate growth.

Failure to timely apply for a refund of the fire/rescue services impact fee shall waive any right to a refund. 
(1)  Upon receipt of application for a refund, and after verifying that the building permit has expired and that the fire/rescue services impact development has not been completed, the city manager shall refund the fire/rescue services impact fee paid for such fire/rescue services impact development.

(f)  Any owner entitled to a refund who fails to file a timely petition for a refund upon becoming eligible to do so shall be deemed to have waived any claim for a refund, and the city shall be entitled to retain and apply the impact fees for growth necessitated capital improvements and additions to the fire/rescue services system. 
(Ord. No. 02-17, § 8, 5-6-2002) 
Sec. 30-859. - Alternative fee calculation. 
(a)  In the event an applicant believes that the impact to fire/rescue services system resulting from his fire/rescue services impact development is less than the fee established, such applicant may, prior to issuance of a building permit for such fire/rescue services impact development, submit a calculation of an alternative fire/rescue services impact fee to the city manager pursuant to the provisions of this section. Upon receipt of the alternative fire/rescue services impact fee, the city manager shall schedule a hearing before the city council at a regularly scheduled meeting or a special meeting called for the purpose of reviewing the alternative fire/rescue services impact fee and shall provide the applicant written notice of the time and place of the hearing. 
(b)  The alternative fire/rescue services impact fee calculations shall be based on data, information or assumptions contained in this division and the impact fee study or an independent source, provided that the independent source is a local study supported by a data base adequate for the conclusions contained in such study performed pursuant to a generally accepted methodology and based upon generally accepted standard sources of information relating to facilities planning, cost analysis and demographics. 
(c)  If a previously approved fire/rescue services impact development project submitted, during its approval process, an alternative fire/rescue services impact study substantially consistent with the criteria required by this section, and if such study is determined by the city council to be current, the fire/rescue services system impact of such previously approved fire/rescue services impact development shall be presumed to be as described in the prior study. In such circumstances, an alternative fire/rescue services impact fee shall be established reflecting the impact described in the prior study. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an alternative fire/rescue services impact study conducted more than two years earlier is invalid. 
(d)  If the city council determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant to calculate the alternative fire/rescue services impact fee complies with the requirements of this section and that the alternative fire/rescue services impact fee was calculated by the use of a generally accepted methodology, the alternative fire/rescue services impact fee shall be paid in lieu of the fee set forth in section 30-869. 
(e)  If the city council determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant to calculate the alternative fire/rescue services impact fee does not comply with the requirements of this section or that the alternative fire/rescue services impact fee was not calculated by a generally accepted methodology, then the city shall provide to the applicant written notification of the rejection of the alternative fire/rescue services impact fee and the reason therefor. 
(f)  Any applicant or owner who has submitted a proposed alternative fire/rescue services impact fee pursuant to this section and desires the immediate issuance of a building permit shall pay prior to or at the time the request for hearing is filed the applicable fire/rescue services impact fee. Said payment shall be deemed paid under "protest" and shall not be construed as a waiver of any right of review. Any difference between the amount paid and the amount due, as determined by the city council, shall be refunded to the applicant or owner. 
(Ord. No. 02-17, § 9, 5-6-2002) 
Sec. 30-860. - Exemptions. 
    The following shall be exempted from payment of the impact fees: 
(1)  Alterations or replacement of a dwelling unit or building with a new dwelling unit or building of the same size or use and which will not increase the square footage associated therewith. 
(Ord. No. 02-17, § 10, 5-6-2002) 
Sec. 30-861. - Changes of size and use. 
    Impact fees shall be imposed and calculated for the alteration, expansion or replacement of a building or dwelling unit or the development of an accessory building if the alteration, expansion or replacement of the building or dwelling unit or the development of an accessory building results in a land use determined to: (1) increase the number of dwelling units; (2) increase the square footage; or (3) change the land use so as to constitute a different impact fee land use category. The impact fee imposed under the applicable impact fee rate shall be calculated as follows: 
(1)  If the impact fees are calculated on land use and not square footage, the impact fees imposed shall be the impact fees due under the applicable impact fee rate for the impact fee land use category resulting from the alteration, expansion or replacement less the impact fee that would be imposed under the applicable impact fee rate for the impact fee land use category prior to the alteration, expansion or replacement. 
(2)  In the event the square footage of a building is increased, the impact fee shall be calculated only for that increased square footage. 
(3)  The impact fee imposed for any accessory buildings shall be that applicable under the impact fee rate for the land use for the primary building. 
(Ord. No. 02-17, § 11, 5-6-2002; Ord. No. 13-01, § 2, 1-7-2013 ; Ord. No. 14-06, § 1, 8-4-2014 ) 
Sec. 30-862. - Vested rights. 
(a)  Any owner of land, which was the subject of a development order prior to the effective date of this division, may petition the city council for a vested rights determination, which would exempt the landowner from the provisions of this division. Such petition shall be evaluated by the city attorney and a decision made based on the following criteria: 
(1)  The existence of a valid, unexpired governmental act of the city authorizing the specific development for which a determination is sought; 
(2)  Expenditures or obligations made or incurred in reliance upon the authorizing governmental act that are reasonably equivalent to the fees required by this division; 
(3)  Other factors that demonstrate it is inequitable to deny the petitioner the opportunity to complete the previously approved development under the conditions of approval by requiring the petitioners to comply with the requirements of this division. For the purposes of this paragraph, the following factors shall be considered in determining whether it is inequitable to deny the petitioner the opportunity to complete the previously approved development: 
a.  Whether the injury suffered by the petitioner outweights the public cost of allowing the development to go forward without payment of the impact fee required by this division; and 
b.  Whether the expenses or obligations for the development were made or incurred subsequent to the effective date of this division. 
(b)  The city attorney shall make a written determination as to whether the owner has established a vested right in the fire/rescue services impact development and, if so, whether the development would exempt the owner from the provisions of this division. 
(c)  Any owner aggrieved by a decision of the city attorney pursuant to this section may request a review hearing on such decision. 
(Ord. No. 02-17, § 12, 5-6-2002)

a.  The amount due and the general purpose for which the fire/rescue services impact fee was imposed; 
b.  That a hearing may be requested within 30 calendar days from the effective date of service of the notice of impact fee statement, by making application to the office of the city manager. 
c.

d.  That in the event the fire/rescue services impact fee become delinquent, a lien against the property for which the building permit was secured shall be recorded in the official records book of the city. 
(2)  The fire/rescue services impact fee shall be delinquent if, within 30 calendar days from the effective date of service of the notice of impact fee statement, neither the impact fees have been paid and received by the city, nor a hearing is requested. In the event a hearing is requested, the impact fees shall become delinquent if not paid within 30 days from the date the city council determines the amount of impact fees due upon the conclusion of such hearing. Upon becoming delinquent, a delinquency fee equal to ten percent of the total impact fee imposed shall be assessed. Such total impact fee, plus delinquency fee, shall bear interest at the statutory rate for final judgments calculated on a calendar day basis, until paid. 
(3)  Should the fire/rescue services impact fee become delinquent, the city shall serve, by certified mail return receipt requested, a "notice of lien" upon the delinquent applicant, if the building is under development at the address indicated in the application for the building permit, and upon the delinquent owner at the address appearing on the most recent records maintained by the property appraiser of the county.

(4)  Upon the mailing of the notice of lien, the city attorney shall file a claim of lien with the clerk of the circuit court for recording in the official records of the county. The claim of lien shall contain the legal description of the property, the amount of the delinquent impact fee and the date of its imposition. Once recorded, the claim of lien shall constitute a lien against the property described therein. The city attorney shall proceed expeditiously to collect, foreclose, or otherwise enforce said lien. 
(5)  After the expiration of one year from the date of recording of the claim of lien, as provided herein, a suit may be filed to foreclose said lien. Such foreclosure proceedings shall be instituted, conducted and enforced in conformity with the procedures for the foreclosure of municipal special assessment liens, as set forth in F.S. ch. 173, which provisions are hereby incorporated herein in their entirety to the same extent as if such provisions were set forth herein verbatim. 
(6)  The liens for delinquent impact fees imposed hereunder shall remain liens, coequal with the lien of all state, county, district and municipal taxes, superior in dignity to all other filed liens and claims, until paid as provided herein. 
(7)  The collection and enforcement procedures set forth in the section shall be cumulative with, supplemental to and in addition to, all other applicable procedures provided in any other ordinances or administrative regulations of the city or any applicable law or administrative regulation of the state. Failure of the city to follow the procedure set forth in this section shall not constitute a waiver of its rights to proceed under any other ordinances or administrative regulations of the city or any applicable law or administrative regulation of the state.

Sec. 30-865. - Developer contribution credit. 
(a)  The city shall grant a credit against the fire/rescue services impact fee imposed by this division, for the development of any building facilities or improvements and additions thereto made to the fire/rescue services system required pursuant to a development order or made voluntarily in connection with fire/rescue services impact development. Such development shall be subject to the approval of the city manager and shall be an integral part of and a necessary accommodation to an existing or contemplated fire/rescue services system. 
(b)  The amount of developer contribution credit to be applied shall be determined at the time that the fire/rescue services impact fee is paid according to the following standards of valuation: the cost of anticipated development to the fire/rescue services system shall be based upon professional opinions of probable cost certified by a professional architect or engineer. 
(c)  Prior to issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall submit to the city manager a proposed plan and estimate of costs for contributions to the fire/rescue services system. The proposed plan and estimate shall include:

Sec. 30-894. - Findings. 
    It is hereby ascertained, determined and declared: 
(1)  Future growth represented by police services impact development should contribute its fair share to the cost of improvements and additions to the police services system that are required to accommodate the use of such facilities by growth. 
(2)  Implementation of the impact fee to require future police services impact development to contribute its fair share of the cost of improvements and additions to the police services system is an integral and vital element of the regulatory plan of growth management. 
(3)  The standard of service for the police services system, as determined in the impact fee study, is hereby approved and adopted by the city. 
(4)  Capital planning is an evolving process and the standard of service for the police services system constitutes a projection of anticipated need for police equipment and facilities, based upon present knowledge and judgment. Therefore, in recognition of changing growth patterns and the dynamic nature of population growth, it is the intent of the city council that the standard of service for the police services system and the impact fee imposed be reviewed and adjusted periodically, to ensure that the police services impact fees are imposed equitably and lawfully, based upon actual and anticipated growth at the time of their imposition. 
(5)  The imposition of the police services impact fee is to provide a source of revenue to fund the development or improvement of the police services system necessitated by growth. 
(6)  The city council specifically finds that police services benefit all residents of the city and, therefore, the police services impact fee shall be imposed in all areas of the city. 
(7)  This division shall not be construed to permit the collection of impact fees from police services impact development in excess of the amount reasonably anticipated to offset the demand on the police services system generated by the police services impact development occurring subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this division derives. 
(8)  Improvements and additions to the police services system needed to eliminate any deficiency between the existing police services system and the standard of service utilized in the adopted impact fee study, as amended and supplemented, shall be funded by revenues other than impact fees. Therefore, the revenue derived from the impact fee shall be utilized only for the acquisition of improvements and additions to the police services system, which are necessitated by police services impact development occurring subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this division derives. 
(Ord. No. 02-18, § 4, 5-6-2002)

Failure to timely apply for a refund of the police services impact fee shall waive any right to a refund. 
(1)  Upon receipt of application for a refund, and after verifying that the building permit has expired and that the police services impact development has not been completed, the city manager shall refund the police services impact fee paid for such police services impact development.

(Ord. No. 02-18, § 8, 5-6-2002) 
Sec. 30-899. - Alternative fee calculation. 
(a)  In the event an applicant believes that the impact to police services system resulting from his police services impact development is less than the fee established, such applicant may, prior to issuance of a building permit for such police services impact development, submit a calculation of an alternative police services impact fee to the city manager pursuant to the provisions of this section. Upon receipt of the alternative police services impact fee, the city manager shall schedule a hearing before the city council at a regularly scheduled meeting or a special meeting called for the purpose of reviewing the alternative police services impact fee and shall provide the applicant written notice of the time and place of the hearing. 
(b)  The alternative police services impact fee calculations shall be based on data, information or assumptions contained in this division and the impact fee study or an independent source, provided that the independent source is a local study supported by a data base adequate for the conclusions contained in such study performed pursuant to a generally accepted methodology and based upon generally accepted standard sources of information relating to facilities planning, cost analysis and demographics. 
(c)  If a previously approved police services impact development project submitted, during its approval process, an alternative police services impact study substantially consistent with the criteria required by this section, and if such study is determined by the city council to be current, the police services system impact of such previously approved police services impact development shall be presumed to be as described in the prior study. In such circumstances, an alternative police services impact fee shall be established reflecting the impact described in the prior study. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an alternative police services impact study conducted more than two years earlier is invalid. 
(d)  If the city council determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant to calculate the alternative police services impact fee complies with the requirements of this section and that the alternative police services impact fee was calculated by the use of a generally accepted methodology, the alternative police services impact fee shall be paid in lieu of the fee set forth in section 30-909. 
(e)  If the city council determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant to calculate the alternative police services impact fee does not comply with the requirements of this section or that the alternative police services impact fee was not calculated by a generally accepted methodology, then the city shall provide to the applicant written notification of the rejection of the alternative police services impact fee and the reason therefor. 
(f)  Any applicant or owner who has submitted a proposed alternative police services impact fee pursuant to this section and desires the immediate issuance of a building permit shall pay prior to or at the time the request for hearing is filed the applicable police services impact fee. Said payment shall be deemed paid under "protest" and shall not be construed as a waiver of any right of review. Any difference between the amount paid and the amount due, as determined by the city council, shall be refunded to the applicant or owner.

Sec. 30-900. - Exemptions. 
    The following shall be exempted from payment of the impact fees: 
(1)  Alterations or replacement of a dwelling unit or building with a new dwelling unit or building of the same size or use and which will not increase the square footage associated therewith. 
(Ord. No. 02-18, § 10, 5-6-2002) 
Sec. 30-901. - Changes of size and use. 
    Impact fees shall be imposed and calculated for the alteration, expansion or replacement of a building or dwelling unit or the development of an accessory building if the alteration, expansion or replacement of the building or dwelling unit or the development of an accessory building results in a land use determined to: (1) increase the number of dwelling units; (2) increase the square footage; or (3) change the land use so as to constitute a different impact fee land use category. The impact fee imposed under the applicable impact fee rate shall be calculated as follows: 
(1)  If the impact fees are calculated on land use and not square footage, the impact fees imposed shall be the impact fees due under the applicable impact fee rate for the impact fee land use category resulting from the alteration, expansion or replacement less the impact fee that would be imposed under the applicable impact fee rate for the impact fee land use category prior to the alteration, expansion or replacement. 
(2)  In the event the square footage of a building is increased, the impact fee shall be calculated only for that increased square footage. 
(3)  The impact fee imposed for any accessory buildings shall be that applicable under the impact fee rate for the land use for the primary building.

Sec. 30-902. - Vested rights. 
(a)  Any owner of land, which was the subject of a development order prior to the effective date of this division, may petition the city council for a vested rights determination, which would exempt the landowner from the provisions of this division. Such petition shall be evaluated by the city attorney and a decision made based on the following criteria: 
(1)  The existence of a valid, unexpired governmental act of the city authorizing the specific development for which a determination is sought; 
(2)  Expenditures or obligations made or incurred in reliance upon the authorizing governmental act that are reasonably equivalent to the fees required by this division; 
(3)  Other factors that demonstrate it is inequitable to deny the petitioner the opportunity to complete the previously approved development under the conditions of approval by requiring the petitioners to comply with the requirements of this division. For the purposes of this paragraph, the following factors shall be considered in determining whether it is inequitable to deny the petitioner the opportunity to complete the previously approved development: 
a.  Whether the injury suffered by the petitioner outweighs the public cost of allowing the development to go forward without payment of the impact fee required by this division; and 
b.  Whether the expenses or obligations for the development were made or incurred subsequent to the effective date of this division. 
(b)  The city attorney shall make a written determination as to whether the owner has established a vested right in the police services impact development and, if so, whether the development would exempt the owner from the provisions of this division. 
(c)  Any owner aggrieved by a decision of the city attorney pursuant to this section may request a review hearing on such decision.

The city shall also attach a copy of the "notice of impact fee statement" to the building permit posted at the affected police services impact development site if the building is under development. Service shall be deemed effective on the date the return receipt indicates the notice was received by either the applicant or the owner or the date said notice was attached to the building permit, whichever occurs first.

a.  The amount due and the general purpose for which the police services impact fee was imposed; 
b.  That a hearing may be requested within 30 calendar days from the effective date of service of the notice of impact fee statement, by making application to the office of the city manager. 
c.  That the police services impact fee shall be delinquent if not paid and received by the city within 30 calendar days of the effective date of service of the notice of impact fee statement, excluding the date of receipt or if a hearing is not requested, and, upon becoming delinquent, shall be subject to the imposition of a delinquent fee and interest on the unpaid amount until paid; and 
d.  That in the event the police services impact fee become delinquent, a lien against the property for which the building permit was secured shall be recorded in the official records book of the city. 
(2)  The police services impact fee shall be delinquent if, within 30 calendar days from the effective date of service of the notice of impact fee statement, neither the impact fees have been paid and received by the city, nor a hearing is requested. In the event a hearing is requested, the impact fees shall become delinquent if not paid within 30 days from the date the city council determines the amount of impact fees due upon the conclusion of such hearing. Upon becoming delinquent, a delinquency fee equal to ten percent of the total impact fee imposed shall be assessed. Such total impact fee, plus delinquency fee, shall bear interest at the statutory rate for final judgments calculated on a calendar day basis, until paid. 
(3)  Should the police services impact fee become delinquent, the city shall serve, by certified mail return receipt requested, a "notice of lien" upon the delinquent applicant, if the building is under development at the address indicated in the application for the building permit, and upon the delinquent owner at the address appearing on the most recent records maintained by the property appraiser of the county. The notice of lien shall notify the delinquent applicant and delinquent owner that due to their failure to pay the police services impact fee, the city shall file a claim of lien with the clerk of the circuit court. 
(4)  Upon the mailing of the notice of lien, the city attorney shall file a claim of lien with the clerk of the circuit court for recording in the official records of the county. The claim of lien shall contain the legal description of the property, the amount of the delinquent impact fee and the date of its imposition. Once recorded, the claim of lien shall constitute a lien against the property described therein. The city attorney shall proceed expeditiously to collect, foreclose, or otherwise enforce said lien. 
(5)  After the expiration of one year from the date of recording of the claim of lien, as provided herein, a suit may be filed to foreclose said lien. Such foreclosure proceedings shall be instituted, conducted and enforced in conformity with the procedures for the foreclosure of municipal special assessment liens, as set forth in F.S. ch. 173, which provisions are hereby incorporated herein in their entirety to the same extent as if such provisions were set forth herein verbatim. 
(6)  The liens for delinquent impact fees imposed hereunder shall remain liens, coequal with the lien of all state, county, district and municipal taxes, superior in dignity to all other filed liens and claims, until paid as provided herein. 
(7)  The collection and enforcement procedures set forth in the section shall be cumulative with, supplemental to and in addition to, all other applicable procedures provided in any other ordinances or administrative regulations of the city or any applicable law or administrative regulation of the state. Failure of the city to follow the procedure set forth in this section shall not constitute a waiver of its rights to proceed under any other ordinances or administrative regulations of the city or any applicable law or administrative regulation of the state.

ARTICLE XIV. - VEGETATION REMOVAL AND PROTECTION 

Sec. 30-931. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this division is the protection of existing vegetation within the city by regulating its removal; to assist in the control of flooding, soil erosion, dust, heat, air pollution and noise; to maintain property, aesthetic and health values within the city; to limit the use of irrigation water in open space areas by promoting the preservation of existing plant communities; to limit the removal of existing viable vegetation when no landscape plans have been prepared for the site. It is not the intent of this division to restrict the mowing of nonprotected vegetation in order to meet the requirements of other sections of this code. 
(Ord. No. 02-23, § 1, 9-3-2002) 
Sec. 30-932. - Applicability. 
    For the purpose of this article, unless listed under exemptions of this code, it shall be unlawful to remove or cause to be removed, native and/or exotic species of vegetation without first obtaining a vegetation removal permit and/or an exotic vegetation removal permit from the community development director. 
    For the purpose of this article, native vegetation references shall meet the statutory definitions and/or lists found in the state division of forestry, the state department of agriculture and the state department of natural resources. References to a specimen tree(s) in this ordinance shall refer to any tree(s) listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, Section 6. 
    Properties may be subject to provisions contained in the final Deltona Settlement Agreement (1982) which could affect the applicability of this ordinance. It is incumbent upon the property owner to ascertain whether their property is within the settlement area, and to know what limitations may apply subject to the settlement agreement. Inclusion of property in the settlement area may not relieve the owner of other jurisdictional, statutory or agency requirements. 
(Ord. No. 02-23, § 2, 9-3-2002) 
Sec. 30-933. - Exemptions. 
    A generalized vegetation removal permit is not required for the removal of protected vegetation other than specimen trees when one of the following conditions is met: 
(1)  A building permit has been issued for the principal structure. 
(2)  The principal structure has been constructed, and the property owner or authorized agent is conducting the removal. 
(3)  Property zoned agriculture (A) where the property is to be used for a bona fide agricultural use as defined by the land development code and application for an agricultural clearing permit has been filed with and approved by the community development director. 
(4)  A site plan and vegetation protection plans have been reviewed and approved by the community development director as part of the final development order. 
(5)  A state licensed tree farm/nursery, where such vegetation is intended for sale in the ordinary course of the licensee's business and was planted for the described purpose. 
(6)  A state licensed land surveyor in the performance of his/her duties, provided such removal is for individual trees within a swatch less than three feet in width. 
(7)  Mangrove alteration projects that are exempted from state department of environmental protection permit requirements by F.A.C. 17-321.060. 
(8)  The city planning board may grant a variance to the provisions of this section if compliance with the mangrove tree preservation standards of this division would impose a unique and unnecessary hardship on the owner or any other person in control of affected property. Relief shall be granted only upon demonstration by the landowner or affected party that such hardship is peculiar to the affected property and not self-imposed, and that the grant of a variance will be consistent with the intent of this article and the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 02-23, § 3, 9-3-2002) 
Sec. 30-934. - Vegetation removal permit application requirements.

Sec. 30-937. - Vegetation protection and removal. 
(a)  Vegetation protection. In general, during construction, cut and fill activities, land alteration, construction material storage, driving or parking of equipment, or trenching, all reasonable steps necessary to prevent the destruction or damaging of vegetation and public and private trees on city owned property shall be taken, including the installation of protective barriers. All new development not specifically exempted by this article shall retain existing native vegetation to the maximum extent possible, especially where said native vegetation exists within required buffer areas. Vegetation destroyed or receiving major damage must be replaced by vegetation of equal environmental value, as specified by the city manager or designee, before occupancy or use unless approval for their removal has been granted under permit. 
(1)  Filling and construction debris. During construction, unless otherwise authorized in the vegetation removal permit, no excess soil, additional fill, equipment, liquids, signs or construction debris shall be placed within the dripline of any vegetation or public and private trees on city owned property that is required to be preserved in its present location. 
(2)  Attachments. Unless otherwise authorized by the vegetation removal permit, no attachments or wires other than those of a protective or nondamaging nature shall be attached to any vegetation and public and private trees on city owned property during construction. 
(3)  Excavation. Unless otherwise authorized by the vegetation removal permit, no soil is to be removed from within the dripline of any vegetation or public and private trees on city owned property that are to remain in their original location. 
(4)  Protective barriers. All protective barriers shall be installed and maintained for the period of time beginning with the commencement of any phase of land clearing construction activities, cut and fill activities, land alteration, construction material storage, driving or parking of equipment, trenching or building operations and ending with the completion of that phase of the construction work on the site, unless otherwise approved to be removed by the city manager or designee's field representative. All protective barriers shall be installed pursuant to the Tree Protection Manual for Builders and Developers, Division of Forestry, State of Florida, or other methods approved by the city manager or designee. 
a.  Areas to be preserved shall be protected during land alteration, construction activities, cut and fill activities, construction material storage, driving, parking of equipment or trenching, by placing a continuous barrier around the perimeter of the area of vegetation and public and private trees on city owned property to be preserved. This barrier shall be highly visible and constructed of wood stakes set a maximum of eight feet apart, at a height of four feet, all covered continuously with brightly colored, all-weather mesh material or equal-type barrier method. An equivalent method may be substituted with the approval of the city manager or designee. 
b.  When the preservation of single trees is required by this Code, a protective barrier shall be placed around the tree at a distance from the trunk of six feet or beyond the dripline, whichever is greater, or as otherwise approved by the city manager or designee's field representative. 
(5)  Equipment. No equipment, waste or materials including, but not limited to, paints, oils, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar shall be cleaned or stored within the dripline on any public or private trees on city owned property. 
(6)  De-watering. During de-watering activities, the discharge from de-watering shall be directed in a manner that does not cause standing water to accumulate at the base of any public or private trees on city owned property. 
(7)  Silt barriers. Silt barriers, hay bales, or similar effective erosion silt control barriers shall be required in any area where erosion or siltation may cause damage to any public and private trees on city owned property.

Sec. 30-938. - Restoration and penalties. 
(a)  Restoration standards. The person(s) responsible for violations of the environmental sections of this article shall be notified according to this article and shall have 30 days to prepare a mitigation plan that is acceptable to the city to resolve the violation. The mitigation plan shall be submitted to the community development director and/or staff for review and comment. Once the community development director accepts the plan, the responsible party shall have 15 days to complete the mitigation unless other arrangements are specified and agreed upon in the mitigation plan. 
(1)  Requirements for a mitigation plan: 
a.  A copy of the deed, contract for sale or agreement for sale or a notarized statement of ownership clearly demonstrating ownership and control of the subject lot or parcel of land, or permission from the landowner to mitigate on his or her site shall be provided. 
b.  The mitigation plan shall be prepared by a person who meets or exceeds the credentials specified in this article. 
c.  The plan shall designate the person's name, address and telephone number that prepared the plan. 
d.  A north arrow, scale, and date shall be required on the plan. 
e.  Existing vegetation areas shall be shown. 
f.  The proposed planting areas shall be clearly defined. 
g.  The plan shall denote the number and location of each plant to be planted, or for the case of ground covers, show them in groupings. Large mitigation areas may be designated by a more simplified method. 
h.  All plants proposed shall be denoted by genus, species, and the common name. 
i.  The plan shall identify what is adjacent to the mitigation areas, i.e. existing forest (provide type), farm, natural buffer area, lake, etc. 
(2)  The mitigation plan shall include the following minimum planting standards: 
a.  In the successful replacement of trees illegally removed, replacement trees shall be of sufficient size and quantity to replace the diameter at breast height (dbh) inches removed. In addition, the understory vegetation shall be restored to the area from which protected trees were unlawfully removed. The selection of plants shall be based on the characteristics of the Florida Land Use, Covers and Form Classifications System (FLUCCS) Code. Shrubs, ground cover, and grasses shall be restored as delineated in the FLUCCS Code. The species utilized shall be with relative proportions characteristic of those in the FLUCCS Code. The exact number and type of species required may also be based upon the existing indigenous vegetation on the adjacent property at the discretion of the community development director. (Dbh is defined for the purposes of this article as diameter of the tree, measured at a height of 4.5 feet above natural grade.) 
b.  Each replacement tree shall be native Florida grade no. 1 as graded by the state department of agriculture and consumer services, grades and standards for nursery plants. All plants not listed in this manual shall conform to FL no. 1 as to health and vitality, conditions of foliage, root system and free of pest or mechanical damage. 
c.  All replacement trees shall be nursery grown, containerized and at a minimum be seven to eight feet in height, have minimum caliper of one to 11/2 inches at 12 inches above natural grade. 
d.  Replacement trees shall have a guarantee of 80 percent survivability for a period of not less than three years. A maintenance provision of not less than three years must be provided in the restoration plan to control invasion of currently listed exotic vegetation. 
e.  It shall be at the discretion of the community development director to allow for any deviation from the above specified ratio. 
(3)  In the event that identification of the species of trees is impossible for any reason on the property where protected trees were unlawfully removed, it shall be presumed that the removed trees were of a similar species mix as those found on adjacent properties. 
(4)  If the unlawful removal of trees has caused any change in hydrology, ground elevations or surface water flows, then the hydrology, ground elevation or surface water flows shall be restored to pre-violation conditions. 
(5)  In the event of impending development on property where protected trees were unlawfully removed, the restoration plan shall indicate the location of the replacement stock consistent with any approved plans for subsequent development. For the purposes of this article, impending development shall mean that a developer has made application for a development order or has applied for a building permit. 
(6)  The community development director may, at his discretion, allow the replacement stock to be planted off-site where impending development displaces areas to be restored. In such situations, off-site plantings shall be on lands under the control of a public land and/or agency. The off-site location shall be subject to the approval of the community development director. 
(7)  The donation of land and/or of funds under the control of a public agency may be made if none of the above are viable alternatives. This donation of land and/or funds shall be equal to or grater than the total sum it would cost to restore the area in which the violation occurred. (Preservation of different contiguous habitats is to be encouraged.) 
(8)  The existing soil types shall be identified. Plants proposed for planting shall be compatible with the soil type. The 1954 or the 1992 soil survey of Collier County shall be used to determine if the plants proposed for planting are compatible with the existing or proposed soil types. 
(9)  The source and method of providing water to the plants shall be indicated on the plan and subject to review and approval. 
(10)  A program to control prohibited exotic vegetation in the mitigation area shall be required. 
(11)  City review of mitigation plan. 
a.  The community development department will review the plan based on, but not limited to, the preceding requirements within 15 days. Additional relevant information may be required when requested. 
b.  Should the city reject the mitigation plan, the reasons will be provided so the applicant can correct the plan and resubmit for city review. 
(12)  Monitoring and replanting. 
a.  A monitoring program shall be required that would determine the survivability by species of the plants used in the mitigation effort. A minimum of five reports will be submitted. Reports shall be due at one-year intervals. 
b.  Eighty percent survival by species shall be required for a five-year period unless other arrangements are specified and agreed upon in the mitigation plan. Replanting shall be required each year if the mortality exceeds 20 percent of the total number of each species in the mitigation plan. 
c.  The soil and hydrological conditions for some mitigation areas may favor some of the plants and preclude others. Should the city and/or consultant find that over time, some of the species planted simply do not adjust, both the consultant and the city shall reevaluate the mitigation plan, and a revised plan will be instituted. This condition shall not apply to all mitigation areas and each case will be evaluated individually, based on the supporting data submitted by the mitigator. 
(b)  Penalties, fines and imprisonment. Any person violating any provisions of this code or the conditions of a permit issued here under, and not specifically covered in this article, shall constitute a misdemeanor and each protected living, woody plant, constituting protective vegetation, removed in violation of this code shall constitute a separate and distinct offense and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $500.00 per violation or by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed 60 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. In addition to or in lieu of the penalties provided by general law for violation of ordinance, the city council may bring injunctive action to enjoin the removal of vegetation in violation of this code. 
(Ord. No. 02-23, § 8, 9-3-2002) 
Sec. 30-939. - Appeal from enforcement. 
    Any person, who feels aggrieved by the application of this division, may file, within 30 days after said grievance, a petition with the community development director, to have the case reviewed by the city code enforcement board. 
(Ord. No. 02-23, § 9, 9-3-2002) 
Sec. 30-940. - Suspension of permit requirement. 
    The city council may, by emergency resolution, suspend the permit requirement for vegetation removal in the aftermath of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, when the following conditions are met and contained in the resolution: 
(1)  The suspension is for a defined period of time not to exceed 30 days or as otherwise set by the city council. 
(2)  The vegetation removal is necessitated by disaster related damage. 
(3)  The suspension is not applicable to vegetation within habitats containing listed species. 
(4)  The vegetation to be removed is not a specimen tree.

(a)  The purpose of this division is to provide a method to objectively evaluate the impact of a proposed development, site alteration, or project upon the resources and environmental quality of the project area and the community and to insure that planning and zoning decisions are made with a complete understanding of the impact of such decisions upon the environment, to encourage projects and developments that will: 
(1)  Protect, conserve and enhance, but not degrade, the environmental quality and resource of the particular project or development site, the general area and the greater community. 
(2)  Minimize the future reduction in property values likely to result, or be caused by improperly designed and executed projects and developments. 
(3)  Reduce the necessity for expenditure of public funds in the future for rehabilitating the environmental quality of areas of environmental sensitivity. 
(b)  Further, it is the purpose of this division to attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation of environmental advantages and risk to public health, safety, welfare and other undesirable consequences. 
(c)  Properties may be subject to provisions contained in the final Deltona Settlement Agreement (1982) which could affect the applicability of this code. It is incumbent upon the property owner to ascertain whether their property is within the settlement area, and to know what limitations may apply subject to the settlement agreement. Inclusion of property in the settlement area may not relieve the owner of other jurisdictional, statutory or agency requirements. 
(Ord. No. 02-24, § 1, 9-3-2002) 
Sec. 30-962. - Applicability; environmental impact statement (EIS) required.

(1)  Any site over ten acres with a ST overlay designation. 
(2)  All sites seaward of the coastal construction control line (CCCL) that are 2.5 or more acres. 
(3)  All sites landward of the coastal construction control line (CCCL) that are ten or more acres. 
(4)  Any other development or site alteration, which in the opinion of the community development director, would have substantial impact upon environmental quality and which is not specifically exempted in this code. In determining whether such a project would have substantial environmental impact the community development director shall base his decision on the terms and conditions described in this code and on the project's consistency with the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 02-24, § 2, 9-3-2002) 
Sec. 30-963. - Submission and review of EIS. 
    A completed EIS, signed by the property owner or his designated agent, shall be submitted to the community development director for approval, denial or approval with modifications. No development or site alteration will be started without this approval and permits required by law. Failure to provide full and complete information shall be grounds for denial of the application.

    The height limitations do not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, water tanks, fire towers when operated by a branch of government, ventilators, chimneys, or other appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level. Human occupancy, even casual use, is prohibited except for routine maintenance. 
(Ord. No. 02-33, § 3, 11-4-2002) 
Sec. 30-1004. - Exceptions to required yards. 
(a)  Yard encroachments. Every part of every required yard shall be open and unobstructed from 30 inches above the general ground level of the graded lot upward except as listed below. Such exceptions, when utilized in yards where recorded easements exist, are allowed with the explicit understanding that any structural improvement(s) or vegetation located within a recorded easement are subject to removal, at the owner's sole expense, when authorized entities must enter upon such easement area to repair, improve, reconstruct or make such lawful improvements as deemed necessary. 
(1)  Sills and other architectural and design treatments shall not project over 12 inches into a required yard. 
(2)  Moveable awnings shall not project over three feet into a required yard.

(b)  Minor improvements to legal nonconforming structures located within a residential zoning district. Where a structure was lawfully permitted within a residential zoning district under a previous code, and where said structure is considered nonconforming under the current land development code due to changes in the required side or rear yards, the community development director may administratively approve a variance for an amount equal to or less then the existing side and/or rear yard encroachment. Canopies, windowsills or other projections as provided for shall not be used in the calculation of existing side and/or rear yard encroachments. 
    The applicant shall follow the procedures as provided below and in addition the applicant shall submit a detailed conceptual site plan drawn to scale depicting all existing structures and the proposed addition, as well as the distance between the property lines and the existing and proposed structures. Additionally, the applicant shall provide proof that the encroaching structure was legally constructed. Such proof shall include, at a minimum, evidence that a building permit was issued for the encroaching structure, or, where such evidence cannot be provided, documentation from the property appraiser's office of the date the structure was placed on the tax rolls. 
(c)  Waterfront yards. It is the intent and purpose of this section to permit the placement of principal structures, except single-family, two-family and duplex dwelling units, at the bulkhead line or shoreline where such placement at the water's edge can enhance the character of waterfront development without detriment to adjoining or nearby properties or without damage to a particular environmental situation. The provisions of this section have their greatest potential application in planning for the use of tidewater inlands or areas of the city of such size and location that the use of this provision will meet its intent and purpose. If the provisions of this section are met, such provisions govern regardless of any requirement for waterfront yards in the zoning district involved. In those cases where the coastal control line is involved, the coastal construction line shall apply. 
(d)  Classification of waterfront lands and building location. Principal structures shall not be erected waterward under this code beyond the following limits for the situations outlined: 
(1)  For waterfront lands along which a bulkhead line has been established, buildings may be erected out to, but not beyond, the bulkhead line. 
(2)  For waterfront lands along which an offshore building limit has been established by the city, buildings may be erected out to, but not beyond, the building limit line. 
(3)  For waterfront lands along which neither a bulkhead nor a building limit line has been established, buildings may be erected out to, but not beyond, the shoreline, as that shoreline exists prior to development and construction. 
(4)  Undeveloped and redeveloping waterfront property shall provide an eight-foot wide pedestrian walkway adjacent to and parallel with the existing seawall and/or waterfront. The walkway shall be provided either along the landward side of the seawall in the form of a hardscape walkway, or along the waterway side of the seawall in the form of a parallel dock. These walkways shall comply with guidelines pursuant to article VIII. 
(e)  Uses. Since this section applies only to the placement of structures in waterfront yards, there shall be no use permitted under this section which is not permitted or permissible in the district involved. 
(f)  Site development plan required. An applicant under this section shall submit a site development plan. In addition the applicant shall submit such materials as will demonstrate that the placement of the proposed buildings in waterfront yards from which they would otherwise be excluded: (1) will not adversely affect adjoining or nearby properties; and (2) will cause no adverse environmental effects of building placement as requested.

Members may voluntarily leave their accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the police department, pending the possibility of being reemployed as a police officer, without losing credit for the time as a member of the plan.

If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a police officer with the police department within five years, the member's accumulated contributions shall be returned at the member's request. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all rights and benefits under the plan are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a member shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which the member has withdrawn the accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the member repays into the fund the contributions withdrawn, with interest as determined by the board, within 90 days after reemployment.

Such payment for said prior service credit may be made as a lump sum or by payroll deductions, not to extend beyond five years, according to a schedule approved by the board of trustees. Payroll deduction payments shall require interest at the actuarial rate of return for the years purchased. Such purchase of prior service credit shall take effect upon attaining six years of credited service in this pension plan. If a member terminates service prior to attaining six years of credited service and receives a refund of member contributions, the amount paid for such prior service credit shall also be refunded. 
(1)  No member shall receive prior service credit for years or fractional parts of years of service if they have withdrawn their contributions to the plan for those years or fractional parts of years of service, unless the member repays into the plan the contributions they had withdrawn plus interest as determined by the board of trustees, within 90 days after re-employment with the City of Marco Island. Further, prior service credit shall not be granted for service where the member is receiving or is entitled to receive a benefit from another governmental pension system.

With respect to any such "additional benefits," for vesting purposes only, credit shall be given for the period of the member's absence from covered employment during "Qualified Military Service". 
(Ord. No. 05-14, § 1(6), 12-1-2005; Ord. No. 15-14 , § 3, 6-1-2015) 
Sec. 32-37. - Disability. 
(1)  Disability benefits in-line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent of being unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability was directly caused by the performance of duties as a police officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent of average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 42 percent of average final compensation, which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following disability retirement and be continued thereafter during the member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with 120 monthly payments guaranteed in any event. Terminated members, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits, except that those terminated by the city for medical reasons may apply for a disability within 30 days after termination. 
(2)  Disability benefits not-in-line of duty. Any member with eight or more years of credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent of being unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of duties as a police officer shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent of average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 25 percent of average final compensation, which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following disability retirement and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with 120 monthly payments guaranteed in any event. Terminated members, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits. 
(3)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits must establish to the satisfaction of the board that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(a)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(b)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(c)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
(d)  Injury or disease sustained after employment as a police officer with the city shall have terminated. 
(e)  Injury or disease sustained while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(4)  Physical examination requirement. 
(a)  A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless the member undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
(b)  Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that the retiree is unable to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a police officer, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights enjoyed at the time the member was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, such member shall forfeit the right to a pension. 
(c)  The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
(d)  If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a police officer, the member's service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which the retiree received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date of reemployment with the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the plan. 
(e)  The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decision regarding all disability claims. 
(5)  Disability payments. 
(a)  The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
1.  If the retiree recovers from the disability prior to the normal retirement date, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or 
2.  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability or attains the normal retirement date while still disabled, the payment due next preceding death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
(b)  Provided, however, the disability retiree may elect, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in section 32-39, which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the disability benefit otherwise payable. 
(6)  Disability benefit offsets. When a member retiree is receiving a disability pension, Social Security benefits and/or workers' compensation benefits pursuant to F.S. ch. 440, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from these sources combined both exceed 100 percent of the member's average monthly wage, as defined in F.S. ch. 440, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the retiree does not exceed 100 percent of such average monthly wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. Social Security disability cost of living increases and cost of living increases provided for under the plan shall not be used to further offset disability benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit be reduced below the greater of 42 percent of average final compensation or two percent of average final compensation multiplied by years of credited service.

(a)  A member with less than six years of credited service upon termination shall be entitled to a refund of accumulated contributions or the member may leave such accumulated contributions deposit with the fund. 
(b)  A member with six or more years of credited service upon termination shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, payable for life, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to the member commencing at the member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined as if the member had remained employed, provided the member does not elect to withdraw the member's accumulated contributions and provided the member survives until benefits actually begin. If the member does not withdraw the accumulated contributions and does not survive until benefits actually begin, the designated beneficiary shall be entitled to the member's accrued monthly benefit payable for 120 months beginning at the member's normal retirement date or a return of the member's accumulated contributions. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, § 1(8), 12-1-2005; Ord. No. 06-03, § 1, 4-3-2006) 
Sec. 32-39. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(1)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(a)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for the lifetime of the retiree only. 
(b)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the member retiree during the lifetime of the member retiree and following the death of the member retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for the joint pensioner's lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is the retiree's spouse, the present value of payments to the retiree shall not be less than 50 percent of the total present value of payments to the retiree and the joint pensioner. 
(c)  A member who retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the plan, based upon the Social Security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(2)  The member, upon electing the option described in subsection (1)(b) above, shall designate the joint pensioner to receive the benefit, if any, payable in the event of the member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change the joint pensioner up to two times as provided in F.S. § 185.341 without the approval of the board of trustees or the current joint annuitant or beneficiary. The member need not provide proof of the good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed, and the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed need not be living. Upon any such new election, the member's final pension benefit shall be recalculated accordingly by the actuary with all costs resulting directly from the new election borne solely by the member. 
(3)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated joint pensioners to receive benefits under the plan shall thereupon cease. 
(4)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree, to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses and shall make repayment of any overage of previously-paid pension benefits as a result of said recalculations. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board, and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no joint pensioner survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree shall be paid to the retiree's estate. 
(5)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(a)  If a member dies prior to the member's normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 32-36. 
(b)  If the joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new joint pensioner is designated by the member prior to retirement. 
(c)  If both the retiree and the joint pensioner designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under subsection (2)(b), above, the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum to the retiree's estate. 
(d)  If a member continues employment beyond the normal retirement date, and dies prior to actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to the joint pensioner or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member, in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date of the member's death. 
(6)  A retiree may not change retirement options after the date of cashing or depositing his/her first retirement check. 
(7)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a member or beneficiary may elect to receive a lump sum payment in the event that the monthly benefit amount is less than $100.00 or the total commuted value of the remaining monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $5,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the plan with regard to such member or beneficiary. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, § 1(9), 12-1-2005; Ord. No. 11-02, § 3, 2-7-2011) 
Sec. 32-40. - Beneficiaries. 
(1)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of the member's death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the plan shall cease. 
(2)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (1), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceased the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the plan with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full value of a benefit providing for payments for a period certain, the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum to the retiree's estate. 
(4)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the plan with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the plan. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, § 1(10), 12-1-2005) 
Sec. 32-41. - Claims procedures. 
    The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, § 1(11), 12-1-2005) 
Sec. 32-42. - Reports to division of retirement. 
    Each year and no later than March 15, the board shall file an annual report with the division of retirement containing the documents and information required by F.S. § 185.221. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, § 1(12), 12-1-2005) 
Sec. 32-43. - Roster of members and retirees. 
    The board shall ensure that records are maintained of all persons receiving a pension under this plan. Such records shall reflect the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the board shall ensure that records are maintained of all members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment.

The fifth trustee shall have the same rights as each of the other four trustees appointed or elected as herein provided, and shall serve a four-year term unless the trustee sooner vacates the office. Each resident trustee shall serve as trustee for a period of four years, unless the trustee sooner vacates the office or is sooner replaced by the city council at whose pleasure said trustee shall serve. Each member trustee shall serve as trustee for a period of four years, unless the trustee sooner leaves the employment of the city as a police officer or otherwise vacates the office of trustee, whereupon a successor shall be chosen in the same manner as the departing trustee. Each trustee may succeed himself or herself in office. In order to establish staggered terms for the appointed and elected trustees, the term for one elected and one appointed trustee shall be shortened to one year for one term only. All future terms of those and all other trustees shall be four years thereafter, as provided above. The board shall establish and administer the nominating and election procedures for each election.

The compensation of all persons engaged by the board and all other expenses of the board necessary for the operation of the plan shall be paid from the fund at such rates and in such amounts as the board shall agree. In the event the board chooses to use the city's legal counsel, actuary or other professional, technical or other advisors, it shall do so only under terms and conditions acceptable to the board. 
(5)  The duties and responsibilities of the board shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:

Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(6)  The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
a.  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the Marco Island City Council to amend or terminate this plan, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this plan, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. The board shall identify and publicly report any direct or indirect holdings it may have in any scrutinized company, as defined in F.S. § 215.473, and proceed to sell, redeem, divest, or withdraw all publicly traded securities it may have in such company beginning January 1, 2010, and shall thereafter be prohibited from purchasing or holding such securities.

(e)  Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to the negligence of the board or trustee, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
(f)  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
(g)  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise.

(i)  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this chapter, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
(j)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid.

(Ord. No. 05-14, § 1(17), 12-1-2005; Ord. No. 11-02, § 7, 2-7-2011) 
Sec. 32-48. - Compliance with the Internal Revenue Code. 
    It is intended that the plan remain at all times a qualified plan, as that term is defined under the Internal Revenue Code. 
(1)  Maximum amount of retirement income . 
a.  The limitations of this subsection (1) shall apply in limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, except as otherwise provided herein, and are intended to comply with the requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and shall be construed in accordance with said Act and guidance issued thereunder. The provisions of this subsection (1) shall supersede any provision of the plan to the extent such provision is inconsistent with this subsection. 
The annual pension as defined in paragraph b. below otherwise payable to a member at any time shall not exceed the dollar limitation for the member multiplied by a fraction whose value cannot exceed one, the numerator of which is the member's number of years (or part thereof, but not less than one year) of service with the city and the denominator of which is ten. For this purpose, no more than one year of service may be credited for any plan year. If the benefit the member would otherwise accrue in a limitation year would produce an annual pension in excess of the dollar limitation, the benefit shall be limited (or the rate of accrual reduced) to a benefit that does not exceed the dollar limitation. 
b.  "Annual pension" means the sum of all annual benefits, payable in the form of a straight life annuity. Benefits payable in any other form shall be adjusted to the larger of: 
1.  For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007. 
(i)  The straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the member's form of benefit, or 
(ii)  The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
2.  For limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007. 
(i)  The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan for the particular form of payment, or 
(ii)  The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this subsection (1), and the amount payable under the form of benefit in any limitation year shall not exceed the limits of this subsection (1) applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Section 415(d) of the [Internal Revenue] Code. For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form. 
c.  "Dollar limitation" means, effective for the first limitation year beginning after January 1, 2001, $160,000.00, automatically adjusted under [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415(d), effective January 1 of each year, as published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, and payable in the form of a straight life annuity. The new limitation shall apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment, but a member's benefits shall not reflect the adjusted limit prior to January 1 of that calendar year. The dollar limitation shall be further adjusted based on the age of the member when the benefit begins as follows: 
1.  For annuity starting dates in limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007. 
(i)  If the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is after age 65. 
(A)  If the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement. 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation with actuarial equivalence computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate assumption and the mortality basis prescribed in [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) for that annuity starting date (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
(B)  If the plan does have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement. 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of (aa) the dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of this subsection (1), and (bb) the limitation determined under subparagraph c.1.(i)(A) of this subsection (1). For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the member, computed disregarding the member's accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 65 is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical member who is age 65 and has the same accrued benefit as the member. 
(ii)  Except with respect to a member who is a "Qualified Member" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, for benefits (except survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the [Internal Revenue] Code), if the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is before age 62. 
(A)  If the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement. 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation with actuarial equivalence computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate assumption and the mortality basis prescribed in [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) for that annuity starting date (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
(B)  If the plan does have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement. 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of (aa) the dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of this subsection (1), and (bb) the limitation determined under subparagraph c.1.(ii)(A) of this subsection (1). 
2.  For annuity starting dates in limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007: 
Age as of Annuity Starting Date: Adjustment of Dollar Limitation: Over 65 The smaller of: (a) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 65, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan, or (b) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 65, computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). Any increase in the dollar limitation determined in accordance with this paragraph shall not reflect a mortality decrement between age 65 and the age at which benefits commence if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken into account. 62 to 65 No adjustment. Less than 62 The smaller of: (a) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 62, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan, or (b) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 62, computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). This adjustment shall not apply to any "Qualified Member" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H), nor to survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the [Internal Revenue] Code.  
d.  With respect to clause c.1(i)(A), clause c.1(ii)(A) and paragraph c.2 above, no adjustment shall be made to the dollar limitation to reflect the probability of a member's death between the annuity starting date and age 62, or between age 65 and the annuity starting date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member prior to the annuity starting date. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the annuity starting date, such an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the member's death if the plan does not charge members for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, as defined in [Internal Revenue] Code Section 417(c), upon the member's death. 
e.  The term "limitation year" is the 12-month period which is used for application of the limitations under [Internal Revenue] Code Section 415 and shall be the calendar year. 
f.  The limitations set forth in this subsection (1) shall not apply if the annual pension does not exceed $10,000.00 provided the member has never participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by the city. 
g.  Cost-of-living adjustments in the dollar limitation for benefits shall be limited to scheduled annual increases determined by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 415(d) of the [Internal Revenue] Code. 
h.  In the case of a member who has fewer than ten years of participation in the plan, the dollar limitation set forth in paragraph c. of this subsection (1) shall be multiplied by a fraction - (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the plan, and (ii) the denominator of which is ten. 
i.  Any portion of a member's benefit that is attributable to mandatory member contributions (unless picked-up by the city) or rollover contributions, shall be taken into account in the manner prescribed in the regulations under Section 415 of the [Internal Revenue] Code. 
j.  Should any member participate in more than one defined benefit plan maintained by the city, in any case in which the member's benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the dollar limitation applicable at that age, the accrual of the member's benefit under this plan shall be reduced so that the member's combined benefits will equal the dollar limitation. 
k.  For a member who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one annuity starting date, the annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to Section 1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d), and with regard to Section 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
l.  The determination of the annual pension under b. of this subsection (1) shall take into account (in the manner prescribed by the regulations under Section 415 of the [Internal Revenue] Code) Social Security supplements described in Section 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits pursuant [to] Section 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
m.  The above limitations are intended to comply with the provisions of Section 415 of the [Internal Revenue] Code, as amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the city shall be exactly equal to the maximum amounts allowed under Section 415 of the [Internal Revenue] Code and regulations thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this subsection (1) and the provisions of Section 415 of the [Internal Revenue] Code and regulations thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of Section 415 of the [Internal Revenue] Code. The value of any benefits forfeited as a result of the application of this subsection (1) shall be used to decrease future employer contributions. 
n.  For the purpose of applying the limitations set forth in Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, compensation shall include any elective deferral (as defined in Code Section 402(g)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code), and any amount which is contributed or deferred by the employer at the election of the member and which is not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of Section 125 or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code. For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2001, for the purposes of applying the limitations described in this subsection (1), compensation paid or made available during such limitation years shall include elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of Section 132(f)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. For limitation years on or after July 1, 2007, compensation shall include payments that otherwise qualify as compensation and that are made by the later of: (a) two and one-half months after severance from employment with the employer, and (b) the end of the limitation year that includes the date of severance. With respect to plan years beginning on or after December 31, 2008, compensation shall also include differential wage payments within the meaning of Section 3401(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(2)  Required beginning date. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, payment of a participant's retirement benefits under the plan shall commence not later than the participant's required beginning date, which is defined as the later of: 
-April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant attains or will attain the age of 701/2 years; or 
-April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant retires. 
(3)  Required minimum distributions. 
a.  Required beginning date. The participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the participant no later than the participant's required beginning date as defined in subsection (2) of this section 32-48. 
b.  Death of participant before distributions begin. 
1.  If the participant dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
(i)  If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 701/2, if later. 
(ii)  If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died. 
(iii)  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
2.  The participant's entire interest shall be distributed as follows: 
(i)  Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in subparagraph b.1. above, over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding: 
(A)  Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the participant's death; or 
(B)  If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(ii)  No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
3.  Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. In any case in which (i) the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins, (ii) the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, and (iii) the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, subparagraphs b.1. and b.2. above shall apply as though the surviving spouse were the participant. 
c.  Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during participant's lifetime. 
1.  Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the participant's spouse. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Treasury regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain. 
2.  Period-certain annuities. Unless the participant's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the participant under the uniform lifetime table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the participant reaches age 70, the applicable distribution period for the participant is the distribution period for age 70 under the uniform lifetime table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of 70 over the age of the participant as of the participant's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the participant's spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this subparagraph c.2., or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and the participant's spouse as determined under the joint and last survivor table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
d.  Form of distribution. Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with subparagraphs d.1., d.2. and d.3. below. If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the [Internal Revenue] Code and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the participant's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the [Internal Revenue] Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the [Internal Revenue] Code and the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
1.  General annuity requirements. If the participant's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
(i)  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year; 
(ii)  The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain, not longer than the distribution period described in paragraphs b. or c. above, whichever is applicable, of this subsection (3); 
(iii)  Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted; 
(iv)  Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows: 
(A)  By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
(B)  To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period dies or is no longer the participant's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the [Internal Revenue] Code; 
(C)  To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the participant's death; or 
(D)  To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment. 
2.  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subparagraph b.1.(i) or b.1.(ii), whichever is applicable) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required beginning date. 
3.  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the participant in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
e.  For purposes of this subsection (3), distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the participant (or to the participant's surviving spouse) before the participant's required beginning date (or, if to the participant's surviving spouse, before the date distributions are required to begin in accordance with subparagraph b.1. above), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
f.  Definitions. 
1.  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the [Internal Revenue] Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-4 of the Treasury regulations. 
2.  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to paragraph b. of this subsection (3). 
3.  Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the single life table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations. 
(4)  a.  Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
b.  Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section: 
1.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: 
(i)  Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; 
(ii)  Any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the [Internal Revenue] Code; 
(iii)  The portion of any distribution which is made upon hardship of the member; and 
(iv)  The portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), provided that a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the [Internal Revenue] Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. 
c.  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code, a qualified trust described in Section 401 (a) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the [Internal Revenue] Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, or, with respect to distributions on or after January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA (subject to the limitations of [Internal Revenue] Code Section 408A(c)(3)) that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. 
d.  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. Furthermore, effective January 1, 2007, a surviving designated beneficiary as defined in Section 401(a)(9)(E) of the [Internal Revenue] Code who is not the surviving spouse and who elects a direct rollover to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the [Internal Revenue] Code or an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the [Internal Revenue] Code shall be considered a distributee. 
e.  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(5)  [Maximum amount of mandatory distribution.] Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the maximum amount of any mandatory distribution, as defined in Section 401(a)(31) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, payable under the plan shall be $1000.00. 
(6)  Compensation limitations under 401(a)(17). In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, the annual compensation of each participant taken into account under the plan shall not exceed the EGTRRA annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning after December 31, 2001. The EGTRRA annual compensation limit is $200,000.00, as adjusted by the commissioner for increases in the cost of living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the [Internal Revenue] Code. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding 12 months, over which compensation is determined (determination period) beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. 
Any reference in the plan to the limitation under Section 401(a)(17) of the [Internal Revenue] Code shall mean the EGTRRA annual compensation limit set forth in this provision. 
(7)  [Interest of members in plan.] At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan with respect to members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
(8)  No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the city council which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of a member or a member's beneficiaries. 
(9)  Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future city contributions. 
(10)  Compliance with F.S. ch. 185. This plan is intended to comply with all applicable provisions of F.S. ch. 185. 
(11)  This plan is intended to be a governmental plan within the meaning of Section 414(d) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, and shall be administered at all times in accordance with Section 401(a) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, as it relates to governmental plans.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 11-02, § 8, adopted Feb. 7, 2011, amended § 32-48 in its entirety as set out herein. Formerly, said section pertained to miscellaneous provisions. See the Code Comparative Table. 
Sec. 32-49. - Repeal or termination of plan. 
(1)  This article establishing the plan and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said plan and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(2)  If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the plan are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the plan in accordance with the provisions of this article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (100 percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal. The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city, or then current plan sponsor, if additional assets are required, in which event the city, or then current plan sponsor, shall continue to financially support the pension plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(3)  The board of trustees shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, that is, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each police officer entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in F.S. § 185.37(3). 
    The allocation of the fund provided for in this subsection may, as decided by the board, be carried out through the purchase of insurance company contracts to provide the benefits determined in accordance with this subsection. The fund may be distributed in one sum to the persons entitled to said benefits or the distribution may be carried out in such other equitable manner as the board may direct. The fund may be continued in existence for purposes of subsequent distributions. 
(4)  After all the vested and accrued benefits provided hereunder have been paid and after all other liabilities have been satisfied, then and only then shall any remaining funds revert to the general fund of the city.

Sec. 32-50. - Exemption from execution, nonassignability. 
    Except as otherwise provided by law, the pensions, annuities, or any other benefits accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this article and the accumulated contributions and the cash securities in the fund created under this article are hereby exempted from any state, county or municipal tax and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment or any legal process whatsoever and shall be unassignable, except the recipient of any monthly benefit may authorize the board of trustees to withhold from the monthly benefit those funds necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the city to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city and to make any payments for child support or alimony. The board of trustees may, upon the written request of the retiree of the pension plan, authorize the plan administrator to withhold from the retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for premiums for accident, health, and long-term care insurance for the retiree and the retiree's spouse and dependents. The pension plan, and its board of trustees, shall not incur any liability for participation in this permissive program should its actions be taken in good faith.

Sec. 32-52. - Forfeiture of pension. 
(1)  Any member who is convicted of the following offenses committed prior to retirement, or whose employment is terminated by reason of an admitted commission, aid or abetment of the following specified offenses, shall forfeit all rights and benefits under this plan, except for the return of accumulated contributions as of the date of termination.

Said member shall be afforded the right to have an attorney present. No formal rules of evidence shall apply, but the member shall be afforded a full opportunity to present a case against forfeiture. 
(4)  Any member or retiree who has received benefits from the plan in excess of accumulated contributions after such member or retiree's rights were forfeited shall be required to pay back to the fund the amount of the benefits received in excess of accumulated contributions. The board may implement all legal action necessary to recover such funds. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, § 1(22), 12-1-2005) 
Sec. 32-53. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions. 
(1)  Rollover distributions. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions.

Sec. 34-33. - Findings; purpose of article. 
    The city council does hereby find the following facts: 
(1)  Construction and future growth that impact park and recreational facilities should contribute their fair share to the cost of improvements and additions to the city park system that are required to accommodate the use of such parks and recreational facilities by such growth. 
(2)  Implementation of the impact fee to require construction to contribute its fair share to the cost of improvements and additions to the city park system is an integral and vital element of the regulatory plan of growth management incorporated in the city's master plan. 
(3)  The standard of service for the city park system, determined by the county through "Impact Fees for Parks and Recreation Facilities for Collier County, Florida, 1991 Update," prepared by Henderson Young & Co. (March 13, 1991, with revisions: March 22, 1991, and any subsequent updates adopted by December 7, 1998) is hereby accepted, approved, and adopted by the city and found to be in conformity with the city's master plan. 
(4)  Capital planning is an evolving process and the standard for service for the city park system constitutes a projection of anticipated need for parks and recreational facilities, based upon present knowledge and judgment. Therefore, in recognition of changing growth patterns and the dynamic nature of population growth, it is the intent of the city council that the standard of service for the city park system and the impact fee imposed be reviewed and adjusted periodically to ensure that parks and recreational facilities impact fees are imposed equitably and lawfully, based upon actual and anticipated growth at the time of their imposition. 
(5)  The imposition of a community park impact fee is to provide a source of revenue to fund the construction or improvement of the city park system necessitated by growth as delineated in the capital improvement budget and the city's master plan. 
(6)  The city council specifically finds that community parks within the city provide a real and substantial benefit to all residents of the city. 
(7)  This section shall not be construed to permit the collection of impact fees in excess of the amount reasonably anticipated to offset the demand on the city park system generated by impact construction occurring subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
(8)  The revenue derived from the impact fee shall be utilized only for the acquisition of improvements and additions to the city park system which are necessitated by the impact of new construction. 
(Ord. No. 98-21, § 1, 1-4-1999) 
Sec. 34-34. - Adoption of impact fee studies; applicability of comprehensive plan.

(March 13, 1991, with revisions: March 22, 1991, and any subsequent updates adopted by December 7, 1998), particularly the assumptions, conclusions, and findings in such studies and as to the determination of anticipated costs of additions to the park system required to accommodate growth.

(2)  After verifying that the building permit has expired and that the construction has not been completed, the city manager shall refund the community park impact fee paid for such construction. 
(3)  The building permit which is subsequently issued on the same property which was the subject of a refund shall pay the community park impact fee as required by section 34-36.

Sec. 34-37. - Applicability to changes of size and use. 
    Impact fees under this article shall be imposed and calculated for the alteration, expansion or replacement of a building or dwelling unit or the construction of an accessory building if the alteration, expansion or replacement of the building or dwelling unit or the construction of an accessory building results in a land use determined to increase the number of dwelling units.

(Ord. No. 98-21, § 7, 1-4-1999) 
Sec. 34-39. - Alternative fee calculation. 
(a)  If an applicant believes that the impact to community parks resulting from his parks and recreational facilities impact construction is less than the fee established in section 34-40, such applicant may, prior to issuance of a building permit for such parks and recreational facilities impact construction, submit a calculation of an alternative community park impact fee to the office of the city manager pursuant to the provisions of this section. Upon receipt of the alternative community park impact fee, the city manager shall schedule a hearing before the city council at a regularly scheduled meeting or a special meeting called for the purpose of reviewing the alternative community park impact fee and shall provide the applicant written notice of the time and place of the hearing. 
(b)  The alternative community park impact fee calculations shall be based on data, information, or assumptions contained in this article and the impact fee study or an independent source, provided that the independent source is a local study supported by a database adequate for the conclusions contained in such study performed pursuant to a generally accepted methodology and based upon generally accepted standard sources of information relating to facilities planning, cost analysis and demographics. 
(c)  If a previously approved parks and recreational facilities impact construction project submitted, during its approval process, an alternative parks and recreational facilities impact study which complied with the criteria required by this section, and if such study is determined by the city council to be current, the parks and recreational impact of such previously approved parks and recreational facilities impact construction shall be presumed to be as described in the prior study. In such circumstances, an alternative community park impact fee shall be established reflecting the impact described in the prior study. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an alternative parks and recreational facility impact study conducted more than two years earlier is invalid. 
(d)  If the city council determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant to calculate the alternative community park impact fee comply with the requirements of this section and that the alternative community park impact fee was calculated by the use of a generally accepted methodology, the alternative community park impact fee shall be paid in lieu of the fee set forth in section 34-40. 
(e)  If the city council determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant to calculate the alternative community park impact fee do not comply with the requirements of this section or that the alternative community park impact fee was not calculated by the use of a generally accepted methodology, then the city shall provide to the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, written notification of the rejection of the alternative community park impact fee and the reason therefor. 
(f)  The decision of the city council shall be in writing. 
(g)  Any applicant or owner who submits a proposed alternative community park impact fee pursuant to this section and desires the immediate issuance of a building permit shall pay, prior to or at the time the request for hearing is filed, the applicable community park impact fee pursuant to section 34-40. Such payment shall be deemed paid under protest and shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights of review. Any difference between the amount paid and the amount due, as determined by the council, shall be refunded to the applicant or owner.

Upon investigation and determination by the city that the condition was not caused by action of the owner, occupant or agent thereof, or third party, the city will not charge the owner, occupant, agent or third party if the city repairs the condition. If it is determined that the owner, occupant or agent thereof, or third party caused the damage, then the person who caused the damage shall be required to repair or replace the damage in the manner provided in this division for the construction of new sidewalks at said person's own cost; or pay the city to make such repairs or replacement. If the property owner, occupant or agent thereof fails to notify the city of any unsafe condition caused by a third party, the property owner, occupant or agent cannot raise the defense to a claim of liability that the unsafe condition was caused by a third party. If the owner, occupant, agent or third party does not repair or replace the damage or otherwise pay the city, the city shall assess the owner of the property for costs incurred by the city for repairs or replacement. Such assessment, if not paid within 30 days, shall become a lien against the property or as provided in this Code or state law.

(d)  Any owner of a parcel which has been assessed pursuant to this section may request a hearing before the administrative review committee to show cause, if any, why the expenses and charges incurred by the city under this section are excessive or unwarranted or why the expenses should not constitute a lien against the property. The request for a hearing before the administrative review committee shall be made to the city manager within 20 days after receipt of the assessment notice from the city. The decision of the administrative review committee shall be final subject to the right of the owner to appeal the decision of the administrative review committee to the city council.

(1)  Upon becoming aware of the presence of offending material, the city shall attempt to notify any responsible person. Notice shall be deemed served by personal service, mail, or posting of a notice of violation upon the property adjacent to the right-of-way. The notice shall require removal of the offending material not later than seven days after receipt of such notice, unless otherwise directed by the city manager or his designee. 
(2)  After expiration of the designated grace period, the city may cause any then-remaining offending material to be removed and be disposed of at the expense of the responsible person.

(6)  If the invoice is not paid in full, a certified letter, return receipt requested, shall be mailed to the property owner or agent advising that a notice of assessment of lien shall be recorded in the official records of the county and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation occurred or exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. The notice of assessment of lien shall include the lien number, the date, a legal description of the property, the name of the recorded owners, and an explanation of the cause of the lien. The owner or agent shall be afforded the opportunity to pay all assessments due, plus a late fee of $25.00, within 14 days from the date of mailing. If full payment is not received within the 14-day period, the city manager or his designee shall record the notice of assessment of lien in the official records of the county. Such assessment shall be a legal, valid, and binding obligation which shall run with the property until paid. 
(7)  After the expiration of one year from the date of recording of the notice of assessment of lien, as provided in this section, a suit may be filed to foreclose the lien. Such foreclosure proceedings shall be instituted, conducted, and enforced in conformity with the procedures for the foreclosure of municipal special assessment liens, as set forth in F.S. ch. 173, which provisions are incorporated in this section in their entirety to the same extent as if such provisions were set forth in this section verbatim.

(2)  If within the designated time the franchisee does not remedy and/or put an end to the alleged violation, the city council, after a public hearing, may direct the termination of the franchise if it determines that such action is warranted. 
(d)  Right to hearing on termination. If the city shall decide to terminate for cause a franchise granted under this article, it shall give the grantee 60 days' written notice of its intention to terminate, and stipulate the cause. If during the 60-day period the cause shall be cured to the satisfaction of the city, the city shall declare the notice to be null and void. In any event, before a franchise may be terminated, the grantee must be provided with an opportunity to be heard before the city council in accordance with due process procedures. If a grantee's franchise is terminated, the decision shall be subject to judicial review as provided by law. 
(e)  Sale of system to new franchisee. If operation of the cable system is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of 30 days or the franchise held by a grantee to construct, operate, or maintain a cable system is terminated by the city council pursuant to the terms of this article, and all negotiations to settle the differences between the parties have failed (provided, however, that such negotiations shall not be required), the city council may advertise and seek another to operate the system. If a franchise is granted to another person, the terminated franchisee may be required to sell the cable system to the new franchisee at a price to be determined by three competent independent appraisers, one each appointed by the terminated franchisee, the new franchisee, and the city council. The appraisers to be appointed shall use the then-best methods of appraising to determine this value. The appraisers' fees shall be shared equally by the terminated franchisee and the new franchisee. The terminated franchisee shall execute such deeds, bills of sale and other documents as may be necessary to effectuate this sale. The terminated franchisee shall fully cooperate with these appraisers. 
(f)  Purchase of system by city; sale of capital improvements. In the event of the early termination of the franchise as provided in this section, the city shall have the option of purchasing the cable business for the fair market value of the capital improvements. The city may also require the grantee to sell any capital improvements as provided in this section to any successor grantee as set forth in subsection (e) of this section. In any event, the city may require the grantee to continue to provide service for a reasonable period not to exceed six months in order to ensure uninterrupted service to subscribers. 
(g)  Removal of facilities and equipment. 
(1)  Should the grantee's franchise be terminated or expire, and not purchased as provided in this section, and at such time as the successor is ready to provide service, but no later than six months from termination or expiration, the grantee shall begin removal of its property within the public way, unless permitted by the city to abandon the property in place. In so removing such plants, structures, and equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavations made by it and shall leave such public and private places in as good condition as that prevailing prior to the company's installation of its equipment and appliances without affecting, altering, or disturbing in any way the electric distribution or telephone cables, wires, or attachments or any poles. The city council or other officer, or his appointee, shall inspect and approve the condition of such public ways and public places and cables, wire attachments, and poles after removal. Liability insurance and indemnity provided for in this article shall continue in full force and effect during the entire period of removal. 
(2)  In the event of any such removal, the grantee shall restore the public right-of-way to a condition satisfactory to the city. Upon abandonment, which shall only be done as the city directs, the grantee shall transfer ownership of all such abandoned property to the city and submit to the city an instrument in writing, subject to the approval of the city attorney, effecting such transfer. 
(3)  If the city or the state is forced to remove the system, the work shall be performed at the expense of the terminated grantee. 
(Ord. No. 98-11, § VII, 9-14-1998) 
Sec. 46-39. - Transfer or assignment of franchise. 
(a)  No transfer of control of a franchise or assignment of a franchise to operate a cable system, other than a pro forma transfer or assignment to a parent or wholly owned subsidiary corporation or other form of organization, shall take place, whether by force or voluntary sale, lease, mortgage, assignment, encumbrance, foreclosure, attachment, merger, or other form of disposition, without prior notice to and approval by the city council. The notice shall include filing particulars of the proposed transaction. The city council shall act by resolution. The city council shall have 120 days after the receipt of the notice and all supporting documents within which to approve or disapprove a transfer of control or assignment of the franchise. If the proposed transfer or assignment is not acted upon within 120 days, approval shall be deemed to have been given. 
(b)  Notice of any such proposed transfer or assignment, together with copies of all documents pertaining thereto, shall be in writing filed with the city clerk. The proposed transferee or assignee shall agree in writing to comply with all provisions of this article and other provisions and requirements as the city council might order. 
(c)  For the purpose of this section, the term "control" is not limited to majority stock ownership, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A transfer of control shall be deemed to have occurred upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons of ten percent of the voting shares of the company. 
(d)  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city council will not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise before completion of initial construction of the cable system or within the first three years of operation thereafter.

Sec. 46-40. - Franchise fee. 
(a)  Amount; payment. 
(1)  Within 60 days after each quarter of its fiscal year, after acceptance of a franchise, the grantee shall pay to the city for constructing, operating, and maintaining the cable system, and for the privilege of providing the cable service during the ensuing fiscal year, a sum equal to five percent of its gross revenue for the preceding quarter. 
(2)  An existing franchisee shall have 30 days following the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived in which to commence payment to the city, for the privilege of constructing, operating, and maintaining a cable system and providing the cable service during the ensuing fiscal year. A sum equal to five percent of its gross revenue for the preceding quarter or portion thereof, commencing with the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, shall be paid to the city. 
(3)  The payment of this fee is in addition to any privilege or use tax or ad valorem taxes which the city may levy. At any time, the city council, its employees or other designated representative shall have the right to inspect all financial documents. Acceptance of payments under this section shall not be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums payable under this article or for the performance of any other obligations under this article. In the event of holding over after expiration or other termination of any franchise granted under this article, without the consent of the city, the grantee shall pay to the city reasonable compensation and damages of not less than 100 percent of its total gross profits during such period. 
(b)  Adjustments. The five percent franchise fee provided for in this section shall be reviewed every five years during the term of this franchise, and the franchise fee, at the sole option of the city council, shall be adjusted upward if the city council determines that an upward adjustment is necessary in order to maintain the franchise fee consistent with: 
(1)  Franchise fees being paid by cable telecommunications companies operating under similar conditions; 
(2)  The costs incurred by the city to administer this franchise; 
(3)  The value of the company's right to use city public grounds, highways, roads, streets, alleys, sidewalks, public ways, and utility easements as may be available; and 
(4)  Any applicable statutes, laws, rules and regulations. 
If the franchise fee is adjusted, such adjustment shall be effective at the beginning of the next immediate file quarter of the company's fiscal year during which such adjustment is made. The city may unilaterally adjust the franchise fee upward only after giving notice to the company and holding a hearing. 
(c)  Annual financial statement; audits. The grantee shall provide the city an annual financial statement within 60 days of the close of the calendar year, certified by an official of the franchisee responsible for the system's financial statements, reflecting the total amounts of gross revenues and all payments and computations for the previous calendar year. Upon ten days' prior written notice, the city shall have the right to conduct an independent audit of the franchisee's records. If, after resolving any dispute arising from such audits, the franchisee has made a franchise fee underpayment of three percent or more, the franchisee shall assume all reasonable costs of such audits. In other events, the city shall bear all costs associated with such audits. 
(d)  Effect of acceptance of payment. Unless otherwise provided by law, no acceptance of any payment by the city shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this article or any franchise agreement ordinance for the performance of any other franchise obligation by the grantee. 
(Ord. No. 98-11, § IX, 9-14-1998) 
Sec. 46-41. - Limitations on franchise. 
(a)  In addition to the limitations otherwise appearing in this article, the franchise is subject to the following limitations: Grantees shall at all times during the life of a franchise granted under this article be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power by the city and other duly authorized regulatory state and federal bodies and shall comply with any and all ordinances which the city has adopted or shall adopt applying to the public generally, and shall be subject to all laws of the state and the United States. 
(b)  Time shall be of the essence of any franchise granted under this article. A grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply promptly with a provision of this article by the failure of the city to enforce prompt compliance. Failure of the city to enforce any breach by the franchisee shall not constitute a waiver by the city. 
(c)  A franchise granted under this article shall not relieve a franchisee of any obligations under any preexisting pole or conduit use agreements it may have with the city, a utility company, or others maintaining poles or conduits in the streets of the city. 
(d)  Any poles, cables, electronic equipment or other appurtenances of a franchisee to be installed in, under, over, along, across or upon a street shall be so located so as to cause minimum interference with the public use of the street and to cause minimum interference with the rights of other users of the streets or of property owners who adjoin any of the streets. All such installations in or upon property owned or controlled by the city shall be subject to the prior approval of the city. 
(e)  In the event of disturbance of any public or private property by a franchisee, it shall at its own expense, and in a manner approved by the city, replace and restore public and private property to no less than the same condition as before the work that caused such disturbance was done. 
(f)  Grantees shall construct, maintain and operate their cable telecommunications systems so as to cause minimum inconvenience to the general public. All excavations shall be properly guarded and protected. At the franchisee's sole cost and expense, the street shall be restored immediately upon completion of all work. 
(g)  Grantees shall, upon reasonable notice from any person holding a building moving permit issued by the city, county or state, temporarily alter their facilities to permit the moving of such building. The actual cost of such altering shall be borne by the person requesting the altering, and grantees shall have the right to request payment in advance. For the purposes of this article, reasonable notice shall be construed to mean written notice received by the franchisee at least five business days prior to the move. 
(h)  If at any time in case of fire or disaster in the city it shall become necessary in the judgment of the city manager or the chief of the fire department or their designee to cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances, or appurtenances thereto of a franchise, such cutting or moving may be done, and any repairs rendered necessary thereby shall be made by the franchisee at no expense to the city. 
(Ord. No. 98-11, § X, 9-14-1998) 
Sec. 46-42. - Installation of facilities. 
    All facilities of a franchisee shall be constructed, installed and located in accordance with the following terms and conditions, unless otherwise specified in a franchise agreement: 
(1)  Without cost to the city, the grantee may be required by the city to locate and identify its cable television facilities within the public rights-of-way. 
(2)  The city reserves the right, upon 90 days' notice, to require the grantee at its expense to protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove from the city's street any property of the grantee by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street construction or excavation, change or establishment of street grades, or installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power or communication lines, tracts, or other types of structures or improvements by governmental agencies or any structures of public improvement. In emergencies, no specific notice period shall be required. The city shall endeavor to notify and seek comment from the grantee, with respect to minimizing disruption to the cable system, where public projects may affect the grantee's cable system. 
(3)  Cable television facilities shall be installed within existing underground duct banks or conduit whenever excess capacity exists. 
(4)  A franchisee with permission to install overhead facilities shall attach its cable telecommunications facilities on utility poles only when pole space is available and comply with the provisions of the National Electrical Safety Code. 
(5)  Whenever any existing electric utilities, cable facilities or telecommunications systems are located underground within a public way of the city, a grantee with permission to occupy the same public way must also locate its cable television facilities underground at no cost to the city. 
(6)  Whenever any new or existing electric utilities, cable or telecommunications systems are located or relocated underground within a public way, a grantee that currently occupies the same public way shall relocate its facilities, without cost to the state or city, underground within a reasonable period of time, which shall not be later than one year from the date of notification. Absent extraordinary circumstances or undue hardship as determined by the cable television administrator, such relocation shall be made concurrently to minimize the disruption of the public ways. 
(7)  Whenever a public way exists to accommodate the grantee's system, the grantee shall not locate its facilities off the public way, unless to serve customers, and shall make every effort to locate its cable telecommunications facilities within the public way before seeking private easements within the city. The grantee shall, at no cost to the city, relocate its facilities and appliances which are in conflict with city projects to upgrade or construct roadways. 
(8)  The grantee shall locate, place and construct its cable telecommunications facilities so as not to interfere with the construction, location and maintenance of sewer or water mains, lines or connections. The grantee shall implement preventive measures to protect existing facilities within the public rights-of-way. 
(9)  The grantee shall restore and replace landscaped areas, pavement, pedestrian lighting, sidewalks, curbs, gutters or other facilities damaged by the grantee or its contractors with like material to their former condition at the grantee's expense, and shall thereafter, from time to time, but no longer than one year from the completion of the job, readjust, fill and finish such facilities as may be necessary due to settling of the earth associated with the grantee's disruption of the public way. 
(10)  Whenever a new cable system will exhaust the capacity of a public street or utility easement to reasonably accommodate future cable telecommunications carriers or facilities, the grantee shall provide additional ducts, conduits, manholes and other facilities for nondiscriminatory access to future carriers. 
(11)  The grantee shall adhere to all federal, state and local regulations regarding the location, construction, and maintenance of its cable telecommunications facilities within the public rights-of-way. 
(12)  All grantees are required to obtain construction permits for the erection of a cable telecommunications system. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city and a franchisee from agreeing to an alternative plan review process or alternate permit and construction procedures. Such alternative procedures must be stated in the franchise agreement. 
(Ord. No. 98-11, § XI, 9-14-1998) 
Sec. 46-43. - Right to use public rights-of-way not warranted. 
    It is understood that the city does not have the unqualified right to authorize a grantee the use of all public rights-of-way. Some rights-of-way may not be under the grantor's control, because of reservations in favor of the dedicators or because of other legal impediments; therefore, in granting a franchise, the city does not warrant or represent as to any particular public right-of-way that it has the right to authorize the grantee to install or maintain portions of its cable system therein. The burden and responsibility for making such determination shall be upon the franchisee. 
(Ord. No. 98-11, § XII, 9-14-1998) 
Sec. 46-44. - Additional rights of city. 
(a)  Amendment of article; conflicting regulations. The city may add to or modify or delete provisions of this article as it shall deem necessary in the exercise of its regulatory powers, provided that such additions or revisions are reasonable and in keeping with the public interest and welfare. Such additions or revisions shall be made only after a public hearing for which grantees shall have received written notice at least 15 days prior to such hearing. In the event of a conflict between any provision of this article (or amendment to it) and a franchise granted pursuant to this article, the provisions of the franchise shall control. 
(b)  Completion of work by city. In the event of the failure by the grantee to complete any work required in section 46-42 or any work required by city law or this article within the time established and to the satisfaction of the city, the city may cause such work to be done and the grantee shall reimburse the city the costs thereof within 15 days after receipt of an itemized list of such cost. 
(c)  Emergency use of facilities. The city reserves the right, in the event of an emergency or disaster, to require the grantee to make available to the city manager, or his appointee, at his request, the grantee's facilities, at no cost, for emergency use during such emergencies or disaster period. 
(d)  Access to grantee's records. The city reserves the right, during the life of any franchise granted under this article, to have access at all reasonable hours to the grantee's plans, contracts and engineering, accounting, financial, statistical, customer, and service records relating to the property and the operations of the grantee and to all other records required to be kept under this article upon reasonable request. 
(e)  Use of poles and conduits for municipal networks. The city reserves the right, during the life of any franchise granted under this article, to install and maintain free of charge upon the poles and conduits of the grantee any wire and pole fixture necessary for municipal networks such as police and fire networks, on the condition that such installations and maintenance thereof do not interfere with the operations of the grantee. 
(f)  Inspections and tests. The city reserves the right, during the life of any franchise granted under this article, to reasonably inspect and supervise, at the grantee's cost, all construction or installation work performed subject to the provisions of the article to ensure compliance with the terms of this article. The city may also perform measurements upon and randomly inspect any portion of a grantee's system to ensure compliance with the technical standards under which the grantee is authorized to operate. Upon the city's request, the grantee will perform the tests, submitting the results to the city. 
(g)  Performance reviews. The city reserves the right, during the life of any franchise granted under this article, upon 30 days' notice, to hold a public hearing for the express purpose of reviewing the general and specific performance of the grantee with regard to all franchise provisions contained in this article or in the future adopted by the city. 
(h)  Governmental rights and powers generally. Neither the granting of any franchise nor any governing provision of any franchise shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power of the city. 
(i)  Right of eminent domain. Nothing in this article shall in any way or to any extent be construed to waive, modify or abridge the city's right of eminent domain in respect to a franchisee. 
(j)  Delegation of powers; enumeration not exclusive. Any right or power in or duty impressed upon any officer, employee, department or board of the city shall be subject to transfer by the city council by law to any other officer, employee, department or board. The city reserves the rights not specifically granted in this article, and the enumeration of the rights in this article shall not be construed to be a limitation of any right or power the city may otherwise have. 
(k)  Hearing on provision of additional channel capacity. The city shall have the authority to order a hearing no less than every three years on the provision of additional channel capacity, if, after a hearing, the city determines that: 
(1)  A requirement for additional capacity exists; and 
(2)  Consideration has been made or will be made for adequate rates to allow the company a fair rate of return on its additional investment. 
(l)  Use of fiber optic cable. Any expanding or hybrid fiber and coaxial cable upgrade of the cable system shall use fiber optic cable to the greatest extent possible to provide the highest quality of service and reduce the number of cascaded amplifiers. 
(m)  Institutional network capacity. With respect to institutional network capacity, a minimum of two six-MHz data channels, two forward and two reverse data paths, shall be reserved by the grantee on its cable system for use by the city, unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement. The grantee shall provide these data channels without charge to the city. These data channel circuits shall be coordinated so as to provide error-free data transmission within and between all fiber optic and coaxial cable segments. 
(n)  Service to governmental facilities and public schools. As a condition of the franchise, the grantee shall provide television and I-Net service to all local governmental facilities and all public school facilities without charge. 
(o)  Contracts for exclusive service. No franchisee or other multichannel video programming distributor shall enter into or enforce an exclusive contract for the provision of cable service or other multichannel video programming with any person, or demand the exclusive right to serve a person or location, as a condition of extending service to that or any other person or location. 
(p)  Limiting compensation for provision of cable service. No franchisee or other multichannel video programming distributor shall engage in acts that have the purpose or effect of limiting compensation for the provision of cable service or services similar to cable service in the city, except for such actions as are expressly authorized by law. 
(Ord. No. 98-11, § XIII, 9-14-1998)

(Ord. No. 98-11, § XVI, 9-14-1998) 
Sec. 46-48. - Additional capacity; interconnections. 
(a)  Authority to order provision of additional capacity. The city shall have the authority to order a public hearing from time to time on the provision of channel capacity for public bandwidth on the network. If, after a hearing, the city determines that provisions have been made to allow the company a fair rate of return on its investments, the city shall order the company to provide such additional capacity within a reasonable amount of time. If the city finds that additional public channel bandwidth is necessary, the company shall, within three months from receipt of written notice from the city, make additional channel bandwidth available. 
(b)  Interconnection requirement. A grantee shall interconnect PEG access channels and I-Net with any or all other cable systems in contiguous adjacent areas, upon the directive of the city. Interconnection of cable systems may be accomplished by direct cable connection, microwave, satellite, or other appropriate method. 
(c)  Interconnection procedure. Upon receiving the directive of the city to interconnect, a franchisee shall immediately initiate negotiations with the other affected cable systems in order that all costs may be shared equally among cable systems for both construction and operation of the interconnection link. 
(d)  Relief from interconnection order. A grantee may be granted reasonable extensions of time to interconnect or the city may rescind its order to interconnect upon the submission of a petition by the grantee to the city. The city shall grant the request if it finds that a grantee has negotiated in good faith and has failed to obtain an approval from the cable systems of the proposed interconnection or that the cost of the interconnection would cause an unreasonable or unacceptable increase in subscriber rates. 
(e)  Cooperation with agencies associated with interconnection.

Any antenna structure, tower or antenna that exceeds its permitted use height as provided herein shall require a variance, wherein the height of the structure, tower, and all antennas shall be determined on a case by case bases. Distance from residential single family and RMF-6 zoning districts shall be a major consideration in determining the maximum height of rooftop towers, antennas and/or structures for variance considerations. 
(2)  Rooftop towers and antenna structures shall be set back from the closest outer edge of the roof a distance not less than ten percent of the rooftop length and width, but not less than five feet, if the antenna can function at the resulting location; 
(3)  Rooftop antenna structures and dish type antennas shall be painted to make them unobtrusive; 
(4)  Except for antennas that cannot be seen from street level, such as architecturally designed panel antennas on parapet walls, antennas shall not extend out beyond the vertical plane of any exterior wall;

b.  New satellite dishes over 1.2 meters in diameter, antennae(s) or other signal receiving or transmitting equipment shall be reviewed in accordance with the conditional use procedures as set forth in section 2.7.4 [sic] of the land development code. 
c.  The installation of antennae(s) or other signal receiving/transmitting equipment that creates electrical interference or is deemed to be out of scale or character of the neighborhood is prohibited unless a compelling public purpose can be established by the applicant, and acknowledged by the city. 
d.  The maximum permitted height for an antennae and/or antenna structure attached to a residential structure is 40 feet as measured from the required base flood elevation or first finished floor elevation (whichever is applicable). 
e.  The maximum permitted height for an approved freestanding tower inclusive of antennas is 35 feet as measured from the required base flood elevation or first finished floor elevation (whichever is applicable). 
f.  Additional height may be requested under the variance provisions contained in the LDC. 
g.  All existing satellite dishes located on a single-family lot with a diameter in excess of 1.2 meters (approximately 47 inches) shall be removed by December 31, 2003, provided the satellite dish is inoperable and/or not being utilized.

(d)  No tower shall be artificially lighted except as required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), or other applicable laws, ordinances or regulations. 
(e)  Any tower that is voluntarily not used for communications for a period of one year shall be removed at the tower owners expense. If a tower is not removed within three months after one year of such voluntary non-use, the city may obtain authorization to remove the tower and accessory items from a court of competent jurisdiction, and after removal shall place a lien on the subject property for all direct and indirect costs incurred in dismantling and disposal of the tower and accessory items, plus court costs and attorney fees. 
(f)  All new metal towers including rooftop towers, shall comply with the standards of the then latest edition published by the Electric Industries Association (currently EIA/TIA 222-E) or the publication's successor functional equivalent unless amended for local application by resolution of the city. 
(g)  A building permit and site plan shall be submitted to the city for all new communication towers and antennas. 
(h)  No communication tower shall be located on any land or water if such location thereon creates or has the potential to create harm to the site as a source of biological productivity, as indispensable components of various hydrologic regimes, or as irreplaceable and critical habitat for native species of flora or fauna. 
(i)  For all towers, a statement from the applicant or an official document that specifies that the tower and its antennas will comply with all applicable regulations of the FCC shall be filed with the city manager or designee. 
(j)  All new non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation (NIER) sources shall comply with the then current applicable standards adopted by the federal government. The city shall not be required by this section to enforce such standards. 
(k)  As to communications towers and antennas, including rooftop towers, antenna structures and antennas, the height provisions of this section supersede all other height limitations specified in the land development code. 
(l)  Subject to general law, provisions in deed restrictions and private restrictive covenants supersede this section to the extent they are more restrictive. 
(m)  Willful, knowing failure of any owner to comply with any of the provisions herein shall be a violation of this section and shall be subject to general penalty provisions of this article, and shall be grounds for revocation. 
(n)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any city ordinance, any then nonconforming tower that is destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its actual replacement cost at the time of destruction, as determined by a cost estimate submitted to the community development director, shall not be reconstructed or repaired without conditional use approval. 
(o)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any city ordinance, including any provision of the general provisions ordinance (ex: nonconformities), a nonconforming tower(s) and/or accessory structure(s) may be voluntarily reconstructed in any zoning district at its site subject to the conditional use procedures of the land development code. The extended useful life of the tower and/or accessory structure that will result from reconstruction shall not be construed to be an enlargement, intensification, increase or extension of the nonconforming use.

Sec. 52-50. - Rates; security deposits. 
(a)  Rate schedules for water, wastewater, reclaimed water usage, fees, and charges shall be adopted by city council through a utility rate ordinance. Such ordinance may be amended by the adoption of a resolution by city council. 
Editor's note- Exhibit A cited herein and being attached to Ord. No. 03-19, has not been set out in the Code, but is on file in the office of the city clerk. 
(b)  The city reserves the right to establish differential rate structures for customers within the urban service area, in which case there shall not be imposed an additional surcharge of 25 percent as provided for in F.S. ch. 180. The city reserves the right to use the same rate structure for all customers within the urban service area and reserves the right to impose an additional surcharge as provided for in F.S. ch. 180. 
(c)  Security deposits. For utility accounts, security deposits are required as follows: 
Meter Size Deposit Amount 5/8 ? × 3/4? $125.00 3/4? 150.00 1? 200.00 11/2? 300.00 2? 450.00 3? and larger As determined by the director  
(1)  For accounts in which the name of the account is the same as the owner, the deposit may, at the discretion of the city, be waived upon presentation by the customer of a statement from a previous utility verifying a history of timely payments by the customer. 
(2)  For accounts in which the name of the account is the same as the owner, and who make a deposit prior to receiving service, the deposit may be refunded after 12 months without a delinquent payment. 
(3)  Whenever service is discontinued, said deposit shall be returned to the customer after first deducting all outstanding charges for service. Where any outstanding charges exceed the amount of the deposit the customer is liable for settlement of said charges under all applicable codes, statutes, laws, and ordinances, and payment of all costs incident to the enforcement thereof. 
(4)  At the discretion of the director, the city may require a deposit or increase the deposit for any customer who is delinquent three or more times. 
(5)  All deposits shall accrue interest as required by Florida Statutes. 
(d)  Water rate structure. The rate structure for water service as set forth in the utility rate ordinance is comprised of two distinct elements. Those elements and their definitions are: 
(1)  Monthly base charge. This is the cost of having the system in place and prepared to serve the customer. This charge is designed to recover all those capital expenses that are not recovered from separate charges and the debt service to pay the bond issues. 
(2)  Monthly consumption charges. This is the cost of providing the water, such as chemicals, electricity, labor and other related costs. This cost is variable and depends on consumption. 
(e)  Wastewater rate structure. The rate structure for wastewater service is comprised of two distinct elements. Those elements and their definitions are: 
(1)  Monthly base charge. This is the cost of having the system in place and prepared to serve the customer. This charge is designed to recover all those capital expenses that are not recovered from separate charges and the debt service to pay the bond issues. 
(2)  Monthly consumption charge. This is the cost of providing for the collection and treatment of sewage such as chemicals, electricity, labor and other related expenses. This charge is variable and depends on consumption. 
(3)  Fees. The city may adopt charges and fees which may include: 
a.  Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the city's pretreatment program; 
b.  Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures; 
c.  Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
d.  Fees for permit applications; 
e.  Fees for filing appeals; 
f.  Fees for consistent removal (by the city) of pollutants otherwise subject to federal pretreatment standards; and 
g.  Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. 
(4)  Surcharge for abnormal strength waste discharge. Abnormal strength wastes are those that do not meet the limitations set forth in this article. 
a.  Computation. The surcharge in dollars shall be computed by multiplying the total milligrams per liter (mg/L) of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids above 500 mg/L times the metered water used during the billing period in millions of gallons times a treatment surcharge factor. The surcharge factor shall be derived annually from the following formula: 
Surcharge factor = Cost of treatment per million gallons ° multiplied by 500. 
Where cost of treatment per million gallons equals operational costs of the city sewage treatment plant(s) for the preceding fiscal year (including pro rata administrative costs) divided by the total sewage flow through all plants in millions of gallons. Five hundred equals maximum normal BOD plus suspended solids content expressed in milligrams per liter. The surcharge in dollars for fats, waxes, grease, oil and solvent-soluble substances shall be computed by multiplying the total fats, waxes, grease, oil, and solvent-soluble substances above the legal limits as set forth in this section times the metered water used during the billing period in millions of gallons times the treatment surcharge factor. 
b.  These fees relate solely to the matters covered by these regulations and are separate from all other fees chargeable by the city. 
(f)  Customer charge. The rate structure as set forth in the utility rate ordinance is comprised of one element with the following definition: 
    Monthly customer charge base fee. This monthly base charge recovers the costs associated with meter readings, billings, postage and related expenses and is charged on every bill issued by the city. 
For accounts in which both metered water service and wastewater service is obtained directly from the city, and at the discretion of the director, this customer charge base fee may be reduced upon verification that the same name is used on both the water service and wastewater service accounts and that both services are issued on the same billing statement created and sent by the city. 
(g)  Reclaimed water rate structure. The rates for use of the city's reclaimed water system shall be based on a charge per 1,000 gallons as provided in the utility rate ordinance. 
(h)  Bulk or wholesale water, wastewater, or reclaimed water agreements and rate structure. Agreements and/or rate structures may provide for the provision or receipt of bulk or wholesale water, wastewater, or reclaimed water services to or from private utilities, governments, or private entities. 
( Ord. No. 12-06, pt. II(Exh. A), 7-16-2012 ) 
Sec. 52-51. - Billing for water, wastewater, and reclaimed water service. 
(a)  Billing shall begin upon installation of the water meter, reclaimed water meter, connection to the wastewater system, or 90 days following notification of the availability of wastewater or reclaimed water service, whichever occurs first. 
(b)  All accounts shall be billed on a monthly basis. Bills are due when rendered and delinquent 21 days thereafter. Bills unpaid after 30 days of being rendered shall be assessed a delinquent fee equal to five percent of the unpaid balance. Service may be discontinued when delinquent for nonpayment of bills. The city reserves the right to place liens on property due to nonpayment of bills. 
(c)  Errors in billing or meter reading should be reported promptly to the customer service office, so as to facilitate the immediate correction of such bill. 
(d)  When water, wastewater, and/or reclaimed water services are provided or made available, payment of the services shall be made concurrently. In the event partial payment is received, such partial payment shall be applied first to penalty, interest and miscellaneous fees component of the total amount due (if any), next to the wastewater component of the total amount due, next to the reclaimed water component (if any), and lastly to the water component. The city may discontinue service for nonpayment of any portion of the service bill. 
(e)  Whether occupied or unoccupied, all existing structures, at the earlier of connection to the city's water, wastewater, and/or reclaimed water system or 90 days following notification of the availability of wastewater service, shall incur a monthly base charge unless such building is destroyed, condemned, or demolished. 
(f)  Whenever a customer discontinues service or vacates a dwelling or structure, the account will automatically revert to property owner of record and billing will resume. 
( Ord. No. 12-06, pt. II(Exh. A), 7-16-2012 ) 
Sec. 52-52. - Reinstatement following discontinued service. 
(a)  When service has been discontinued for nonpayment of bills, service will be restored upon payment of unpaid bills, plus a service fee as set forth in the rate ordinance. Said service fees shall also be payable in the event the city attempts to restore service but is unable to do so due to meter obstruction. 
(b)  The service line gate valve or curb stop valve may be locked in the off position or the meter removed from the premises. The monthly base facility charges shall continue. Should an applicant at a later time request renewal of service to said premises, service will be restored upon full payment of all bills due for service to the premises at the time of discontinuance and a reinstatement charge. 
(c)  Where service has been disconnected for a violation of an ordinance or regulation, such service shall not be reconnected until the city manager, or his designee, receives adequate assurances and guarantees that such a violation will not recur.

d.  Use of low volume mobile equipment washing, provided all unused water drains into only a pervious ground surface. 
(2)  A variance from specific day or days identified in Resolution 10-20 may be granted if strict application of the restrictions would lead to unreasonable or unfair result in particular instances, provided that the applicant demonstrates with particularity that compliance with the schedule will result in substantial economic, health, or other hardship on the applicant requiring a variance or those served by the applicant. Where a contiguous property is divided into different zones a variance may be granted hereunder so that each zone may be irrigated on days different than other zones of the property. However, no single zone may be irrigated more than three days per week. 
a.  The city manager, or designee, shall be the only individual(s) authorized to grant or deny variances pursuant to this subsection. A decision to grant or deny the variance should be made within ten days after actual receipt of a complete application for the variance. 
b.  Any individual or entity aggrieved by the denial of a variance from this section shall have the right of appeal to the city council. Such appeal shall be taken by filing with the city manager, within 14 days after notice of the denial of the variance has been delivered to such person or entity's last known address, a written statement setting forth fully the grounds for the appeal. The city manager shall set a hearing on such appeal for the next available city council meeting. Notice of such hearing shall be given to the appellant at least ten days before the date of said hearing. The decision and order of the city council on such appeal shall be final. 
c.  An application for variance and/or the granting of a variance shall operate prospectively and shall not affect any then pending enforcement action pursuant to this section or otherwise. 
d.  The city hereby recognizes any and all variances issued by the South Florida Water Management District to those users who operate and maintain smart irrigation systems which meet the requirements of F.S. § 373.62(7).

(8)  A current seating chart of the facility depicting the number of indoor and outdoor seats. 
(c)  Facilities with shared interceptor. In addition, the owner of the shared interceptor used by multiple FSF shall be issued a separate permit requiring compliance with this division and the Florida Administrative Code. 
(d)  Pre-permit inspection procedure. 
(1)  Individual FSF. Once a completed application form has been reviewed by the CMD, the FSF will be inspected prior to the issuance of the GDP beginning August 1 through November 1 every year. During the pre-permit inspection, the information contained in the application form will be verified and the grease interceptor or trap will be inspected during a scheduled cleaning when the trap or interceptor is empty and owner or designee present. If all information is verified and the grease interceptor or trap is in proper working condition, a GDP will be issued. If the grease interceptor or trap requires any maintenance/repairs or incorrect information has been given, the GMP official shall provide a written notice of noncompliance to correct any deficiencies, including a required time schedule for repairs to be corrected prior to a second pre-permit inspection. Second pre-permit inspections shall be performed after a minimum of ten calendar days have elapsed to allow for corrective action by the FSF to occur. If the facility is not in compliance at the second pre-permit inspection, a noncompliance fee will be levied. An application for a permit shall be granted with conditions or denied within 30 days after the date of the last pre-permit inspection. 
(e)  Grease discharge permit. The following criteria apply to all GDPs: 
(1)  Each GDP shall be effective for a one-year period and shall have an effective and an expiration date. GDPs will be issued from August 1 through November 1 every year. 
(2)  The GDP must be displayed in a conspicuous place where it can be seen by the staff of the FSF and a copy of the GDP must be kept in the records file. 
(3)  The GDP shall be issued to a specific user for a specific operation. GDPs will vary in content and requirements depending on the class of the FSF and the type of grease removal devices(s) installed. A GDP shall not be transferred or sold to a new owner under any circumstances. A new owner is required to apply for a new GDP at the time of zoning permit application. The new GDP will be issued on a prorated basis and will expire at the end of the current permit period. 
(4)  Issuance of GDP will be 60 days prior to the expiration date of the existing GDP. 
(5)  The terms and conditions of the GDP are subject to modification by the City during the term of the permit, if limitations or requirements in this program are modified. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in the issued permit at least 60 days prior to the effective date of the change(s). Any changes or new conditions in the GDP shall include a reasonable schedule for achieving compliance. 
(f)  Entry. Each FSF shall allow the CMD at all reasonable hours to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, observation, records examination, measurement, sampling and testing in accordance with the provisions of this division. The refusal of any FSF to allow the CMD entry to or upon the facility's premises for purposes of inspection, sampling effluents, inspecting and copying records or performing such other duties as shall be required by this division shall constitute a violation of this division. The CMD may seek a warrant or use such other legal procedures as may be advisable and reasonably necessary to discharge his duties pursuant to this division.

Sec. 52-132. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 6. - IMPACT FEES 

Sec. 52-133. - Findings. 
    It is hereby ascertained, determined and declared: 
(1)  The Florida Legislature has adopted growth management legislation which requires local governments to plan for and provide for capital infrastructure facilities and services. 
(2)  Development necessitates additional water and wastewater facilities and such development must contribute its fair share toward the costs of funding improvements and additions to such facilities. 
(3)  Implementation of an impact fee to require future development to contribute its fair share of the cost of improvements and additions to the water and wastewater facilities is an integral and vital element of the regulatory plan of growth management by the city. 
(4)  The level of service standards for the water and wastewater facilities as adopted in the City of Marco Island Comprehensive Plan and Utility Master Plans, as may hereafter be adopted and amended from time to time, are controlling upon this division and are incorporated throughout this division. 
(5)  Capital planning is an evolving process and the level of service standards for the water and wastewater facilities constitutes a projection of anticipated need for water and wastewater facilities, based upon present knowledge and judgment. Therefore, in recognition of changing growth patterns and the dynamic nature of population growth, it is the intent of the city that the level of service standards, system capacity, and required capacity expansions for the water and wastewater facilities and the impact fee imposed should be reviewed and adjusted periodically to try to ensure that the impact fees are imposed equitably and lawfully and are based upon actual and anticipated growth at the time of their imposition. 
(6)  The imposition of the impact fee is to provide a source of revenue to fund the construction or improvement of the water and wastewater facilities necessitated by growth. 
(7)  The city council finds that water and wastewater facilities benefit all residents of the urban service area and, therefore, the impact fee shall be imposed in all areas of the urban service area. 
(8)  This division is not intended to, and shall not be construed to, permit the collection of impact fees from development in excess of the amount reasonably anticipated to offset the reasonably allocated demand on each of the water and wastewater facilities generated by the respective development. 
(9)  The revenue derived from the impact fee shall be utilized only for capital improvements and additions to the water and wastewater facilities which are reasonably determined to be caused by the impacts of new development. 
( Ord. No. 12-06, pt. II(Exh. A), 7-16-2012 ) 
Sec. 52-134. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this division to: 
(1)  Plan for the necessary capacity expansion of the water and wastewater facilities; 
(2)  Provide for the health, safety, welfare and economic well-being of the residents and visitors of the city; 
(3)  Implement and be consistent with the City of Marco Island Comprehensive Plan and the Florida Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act, F.S. § 163.3161 et seq.; 
(4)  Require all development that places additional demand on the water and wastewater facilities to contribute its proportionate share of the funds, land or water and wastewater facilities to accommodate any impacts having a rational nexus to the proposed development and for which the need is reasonably attributable to the proposed development; and 
(5)  Ensure that no funds, land or water and wastewater facilities are collected from new development in excess of the actual amount reasonably determined necessary to offset the demand on the water and wastewater facilities generated by new development. 
    This division is intended to be consistent with the principles applied to allocate a fair share of the cost of new water and wastewater facilities to new users and new development as established in Florida Statutes or applicable judicial decisions, or both.

Impact fee credits will be accomplished only through the operation of a credit agreement. Should an assignment of credit be approved by the city through execution of such an agreement, the assignee shall take the agreement as is and shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the agreement as originally executed by the assignor and other parties. No assignee (or transferee) of any such agreement shall have the right to any review procedure under this chapter except to the extent expressly granted in the agreement. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to subsequent purchasers or successors in title to the owner. 
(g)  Any applicant who submits a proposed credit agreement pursuant to this division and desires the immediate issuance of a building permit shall pay the impact fee prior to or at the time of the application for the building permit. Said payment shall be deemed paid "under protest" and shall not be construed as a waiver of any review rights. Any difference between the amount paid and the amount due, as determined by the city manager, shall be refunded to the applicant or owner. 
(h)  In the event the amount of impact fee credit, pursuant to an approved contribution or dedication, exceeds the total amount of impact fee imposed upon the development, the contribution agreement may provide for the future reimbursement to the owner of the excess of such contribution credit from future receipts by the city of impact fees. However, no reimbursement shall be paid until such time as all development at the location that was subject to the credit has been completed. Such reimbursement shall be made over a period of five years from the date of completion of the development as determined by the city. 
( Ord. No. 12-06, pt. II(Exh. A), 7-16-2012 ) 
Sec. 52-143. - Collection of impact fees in default. 
    Whenever the city determines that an impact fee was not paid prior to the issuance of a building permit for the affected development, or connection to the water or wastewater system, the city shall proceed to collect the impact fee as follows: 
(1)  The city shall serve a "notice of impact fee statement" upon the applicant at the address set forth in the application for building permit, and the owner at the address appearing on the most recent records maintained by the property appraiser of the county. The city shall also attach a copy of the "notice of impact fee statement" to the building permit posted at the affected development site if the building is under construction. Service shall be deemed effective on the date the return receipt indicates the notice was received by either the applicant or the owner or the date said notice was attached to the building permit, whichever occurs first, or by any other evidence of the date that the "notice" was received by the addressee. The "notice of impact fee statement" shall contain a description of the property and shall advise the applicant and the owner as follows: 
a.  The amounts due, the date that the impact fee became delinquent, and that as of that date the unpaid impact fee became subject to the delinquency fee, and that interest began to accrue on that date, and that such interest will continue to accrue thereafter until all amounts due are paid in full; that in the event the impact fee and the delinquency fee are paid in full within 30 days after receipt of the "notice," all interest that would have otherwise accrued will be waived; that in the event the impact fee is not paid in full within 30 days after receipt of the "notice", a lien against the property for which the building permit was secured may be recorded in the official records book of the county for all amounts then due after approval by the city manager. 
(2)  Upon becoming delinquent, a delinquency fee equal to ten percent of the total impact fee imposed shall be assessed. Once delinquent, the total impact fee, plus delinquency fee, shall bear interest at the then applicable statutory rate for final judgments calculated on a calendar day basis, until paid in full. 
(3)  Should the impact fee not be paid promptly, the city shall serve a "notice of lien" upon the delinquent applicant, if the building is under construction at the address indicated in the application for the building permit, and upon the delinquent owner at the address appearing on the most recent records maintained by the property appraiser of the county. The notice of lien shall notify the delinquent applicant and delinquent owner that due to their failure to pay the impact fee, the city may file a claim of lien with the clerk of the circuit court. 
(4)  The collection and enforcement procedures set forth in this section shall be cumulative with, supplemental to and in addition to, all other applicable procedures provided in any other ordinances or administrative regulations of the city or any applicable law or administrative regulation of the State of Florida. Failure of the city to follow the procedure set forth in this section shall not constitute a waiver of its rights to proceed under any other ordinances or administrative regulations of the city or any applicable law or administrative regulation of the State of Florida. 
(5)  If the total impact fees have not been received by the city within 30 days of the posting of the notice of claim of lien (or receipt of the notice by the owner or trustee), the city manager may then, regardless of the filing of any appeal petition, file a claim of lien with the clerk of the circuit court and record same in the Official Records of Collier County. The recorded claim of lien shall contain the legal description of the property, the amount of the delinquent impact fee, plus the delinquency fee and interest, and the date the impact fee became due. Once recorded, the claim of lien shall constitute a lien against the property described therein. The city manager may proceed expeditiously to collect, foreclose, or otherwise enforce said lien. 
(6)  After the expiration of 30 days from the date of recording of the claim of lien, as provided herein, a suit may be filed to foreclose said lien. Such foreclosure proceedings shall be instituted, conducted and enforced in conformity with the procedures for the foreclosure of municipal special assessment liens, as set forth in F.S. ch. 173, as then amended, which provisions are hereby incorporated herein in their entirety to the same extent as if such provisions were set forth herein verbatim. 
(7)  The liens for delinquent impact fees imposed hereunder shall remain liens, coequal with the lien of all state, county, district and municipal taxes, superior in dignity to all other filed liens and claims, until paid as provided herein. 
(8)  The foregoing paragraphs of this section notwithstanding, all impact fees not paid to the city in full when due shall automatically become "delinquent." Moreover, when any impact fees become delinquent anywhere throughout the unified whole of the respective development, the city is authorized to withhold every then unissued development order(s) and permits applied for by, or on behalf of, the landowner or the developer, and in addition apply any and all of the civil penalties and remedies set forth in the land development code until all such delinquent impact fees have been paid to the city in full.

Sec. 52-144. - Update requirement. 
(a)  This division and the impact fee studies shall be reviewed by the city council initially in connection with its approval of the capital improvements element of its comprehensive plan as then, and to the extent, required by F.S. § 163.3177. This division and the impact fee studies should be reviewed at least every five years. All reviews shall consider new estimates of population and other socioeconomic data; changes in construction, land acquisition and related costs and adjustments to the assumptions, conclusions or findings set forth in the studies adopted by section 52-135. The purpose of this review is to evaluate and revise impact fees to assure that they do not exceed the reasonably anticipated costs associated with the improvements and additions necessary to offset the demand on the water and wastewater facilities generated by development. In the event the review of this division alters or changes the assumptions, conclusions and findings of the studies adopted by reference in section 52-135, revises or changes the water and wastewater facilities, or alters or changes the amount of impact fees, the studies adopted by reference in section 52-135 shall be amended and updated to reflect the assumptions, conclusions and findings of such reviews. 
(b)  Simultaneous with the review of the impact fee studies required in subsection (a), the city council shall review the capital improvements element to determine the availability and adequacy of revenue sources to construct improvements and additions to the water and wastewater facilities determined in the impact fee study to be required to accommodate existing development.

ARTICLE IV. - BOAT DOCKING FACILITIES 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 54-100. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is the intent and purpose of this article to provide for the adequate securing of moored vessels and to provide safe access by users for routine maintenance and use while minimizing the impact on the navigability of the waterway, native marine habitat, manatees, and the use and view of the waterway by surrounding property owners. It is further the intent of this article to provide reasonable access for vessel, seawall, and dock maintenance. 
    It is recognized that specific waterway locations warrant special consideration due to severe access and navigational challenges, and community character and aesthetic impacts. City council may authorize the establishment of overlay districts, with district specific dimensional standards and regulations, to address boat docking facilities within the overlay area(s). 
(Ord. No. 00-04, § 1, 4-17-2000; Ord. No. 03-15, § 1, 9-3-2003) 
Sec. 54-101. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Associated infrastructure means seawalls, revetments, caps, support piles, whalers, riprap, and like physical improvements which supports a boat dock facility in conjunction with the upland host property. 
    Boat cover means a portable or fixed aluminum, PVC, galvanized or similar structure which is attached to a dock or boatlift and which structure is covered with canvas, vinyl, aluminum or similar materials and utilized for protecting a vessel over or contiguous to navigable water. A boat cover shall not be considered or qualify as a boathouse and shall not be installed, repaired or reconstructed. A covering, commonly referred to as a mooring cover, which is fixed to the vessel for the purpose of protecting the vessel shall not be considered a boat cover. 
    Boat docking facility means any structure, whether fixed in position or floating, constructed on or over a waterway for the primary purpose of mooring a boat and that provides access to a vessel from the adjacent upland property. This includes docks, walkways, piers, boatlifts, personal watercraft lifts, davits, mooring piles, dolphins, boathouses, nautical garages and associated cut-in boat slips/boat basins from any water body in single-family residential zoning district properties. A walkway immediately adjacent to or as part of a nautical garage in the rear yard setback across the cut-in boat slip/boat basin associated with the nautical garage is permitted as an encroachment into the rear yard setback provided no part of the walkway exceeds 30 inches above grade of the land within the rear yard setback. 
    Boathouse means a structure with a roof which is constructed of palm fronds, cedar shakes, or the same material and color of the principal structure on the property, accessory use to a residential structure over or contiguous to navigable water, open on all sides and providing covered protection to a boat and accessories customary thereto. 
    Boatlift means any mechanical structure, including a davit, capable of lifting or raising a vessel clear of the water. 
    Live-aboard vessel shall have the same meaning as used in F.S. § 327.02, as may be subsequently modified or amended from time to time. 
    Marginal dock means a dock which protrudes five feet or less into the waterway. 
    Moored vessel, for the purposes of this article, shall refer to the overall length of the vessel, including the pulpit, motor, and any other accessories attached to the vessel. 
    Mooring cover means a tailored canvas covering which is affixed to the vessel for the purpose of protecting the vessel. 
    Mooring cover assist system means a cantilevered structure with a mono-rail track to support the full weight of a tailored mooring cover as it is removed or installed on a vessel. The assist's mooring cover is attached directly to the vessel when in the covered position but may also be mechanically connected to the underside of the overhead mono-rail track so that the mooring cover is ready to be removed or installed on a vessel utilizing the assist. 
    Multifamily residential zoning district means any real property located within the residential multiple family-6 (RMF-6) zoning district as described in section 30-101 et seq. of this Code, the residential multiple family-12 (RMF-12) zoning district as described in section 30-121 et seq., the residential multiple family-16 (RMF-16) zoning district as described in section 30-141 et seq., the residential tourist (R-T) zoning district as described in section 30-161 et seq., or the portion of the planned unit development zoning district set forth in section 30-381 et seq. devoted to multiple-family residential development. 
    Nautical garage is defined in section 30-10 of this Code. 
    Personal watercraft (PWC) means a vessel less than 16 feet in length which uses an inboard motor powering a water jet pump as its primary source of power and which is designed to be operated by a person sitting, standing or kneeling on, rather than the conventional manner of sitting or standing inside the vessel. 
    Personal watercraft (PWC) lift means any mechanical structure capable of lifting or raising a PWC clear of the water. 
    Riparian line means an imaginary line beginning at the point at which property lines intersect the mean high water line of a waterway and continuing into the waterway indefinitely. The purpose of the riparian line, as employed by this article, is to provide a point of reference from which to measure setbacks for docking facilities. Riparian lines shall be established according to the following unless contradicted or approved by the state board of trustees of the internal improvement trust fund: 
(1)  Lots at the end or side end of a waterway with a regular shoreline are established by a line extending from the corner of an end lot and side end lot into the waterway bisecting equidistantly the angle created by the two intersecting lots. 
(2)  Riparian lines for all other lots should be established by generally accepted methods, taking into consideration the configuration of the shoreline, and allowing for the equitable apportionment of riparian rights. Included, but not limited to, are lines drawn perpendicular to the shoreline for regular (linear) shorelines, or lines drawn perpendicular to the centerline (thread) of the waterway, or perpendicular to the line of deep water (line of navigability or edge of navigable channel) as appropriate for irregular shorelines. No boat docking facility shall be constructed so as to encroach upon the riparian rights of other property owners. 
    Riparian rights shall have the same meaning as used in F.S. § 253.141, as may be subsequently modified or amended from time to time. This term is currently defined as follows: Riparian rights are those incidental to land bordering upon navigable waters. They are rights of ingress, egress, boating, bathing, and fishing and such others as may be or have been defined by law. Such rights are not of a proprietary nature. They are rights inuring to the owner of the riparian land but are not owned by him or her. They are appurtenant to and are inseparable from the riparian land. The land to which the owner holds title must extend to the ordinary high watermark of the navigable water in order that riparian rights may attach. Conveyance of title to or lease of the riparian land entitles the grantee to the riparian rights running therewith whether or not mentioned in the deed or lease of the upland. 
    Seawall support pilings means pilings which are installed against the waterward side of a seawall for the purpose of providing additional support to the seawall and/or providing protection to the seawall from vessels. 
    Setback means a line marking the minimum open space distance between a property line, right-of-way line, bulkhead line, shoreline, seawall, mean high water mark, access easement line, or other defined location, whichever is most restrictive, and the beginning point of a required yard or the buildable area. 
    Single-family residential zoning district means the zoning district devoted primarily to single-family dwelling housing in the RSF 2, RSF 3, and RSF 4 zoning districts, all as set forth in sections 30-81 through 30-89 of this Code, or the portion of the planned unit development zoning district set forth in section 30-381 et seq. devoted to single-family residential dwelling development. 
    Sovereign submerged lands shall have the same meaning as used in F.A.C. § 18-21.003, as may be subsequently modified or amended from time to time. 
    Sovereign submerged land lease shall have the same meaning as used in F.A.C. § 18-21.003, as may be subsequently modified or amended for time to time. 
    Swivel PWC lift means any mechanical structure capable of lifting or raising a PWC clear of the water and which swivels so that the vessel is stored on the property or on top of a boat docking facility.

Sec. 54-117. - Manatee protection. 
(a)  Purpose of section. The following are for the purpose of manatee protection and will be applicable to all multi-slip docking facilities with ten slips or more, and all marina facilities. 
(b)  Manatee protection. 
(1)  Proposed developments will be reviewed for consistency with the manatee protection plan (MPP) adopted by the Collier County Board of County Commissioners and approved by the state department of environmental protection. If the location of the proposed development is consistent with the MPP, then the developer will submit a "manatee awareness and protection plan", which shall address, but not be limited to, the following categories: 
a.  Education and public awareness; 
b.  Posting and maintaining manatee awareness signs; 
c.  Information on type and destination of boat traffic that will be generated from the facility; 
d.  Monitoring and maintenance of water quality to comply with state standards; 
e.  Marking of navigational channels may be required. 
(c)  Marina siting. 
(1)  The purpose of the marina site rating system is to help determine the maximum wet slip densities in order to improve existing manatee protection. The marina site rating system gives a ranking based on three criteria; water depth, native marine habitat, and manatee abundance. In evaluating a parcel for a potential boat facility, a minimum sphere of influence for the boat traffic must be designated. For this plan an on-water travel distance of five miles is considered the sphere of influence. 
(2)  Rating criteria. 
a.  A preferred rating is given to a site that has or legally create adequate water depth and access, will not impact native marine habitats, and will not impact a high manatee use area (see Table 1). 
b.  A moderate ranking is given to a site where; there is an adequate water depth and access, no impact to a high manatee use area, but there is an impact to native marine habitat; there is adequate water depth, no impact to native marine habitat, but impacts a high manatee use area; and when the water depth is less than four feet mean low water (MLW), no impact to native marine habitat, and no impact to a high manatee use area. 
c.  A protected ranking is given to a site where; there is adequate water depth and access, but there is an impact to native marine habitat and there is an impact to a high manatee use area; there is not adequate water depth, there is impact to or destruction of native marine habitat and there is impact to a high manatee use area; there is not adequate water depth, no impact to marine habitat, but there is impact to a high manatee use area; or there is not adequate depth, there is impact to marine habitat and no impact to a high manatee use area. 
d.  The exact areas will depend on site specific data gathered during the site development process.

*For shoreline vegetation such as mangroves, no impact is defined as no greater than five percent of the native marine habitat is disturbed. For sea grasses, no impact means that no more than 100 square feet of sea grasses can be impacted. 
(d)  Allowable wet slip densities. 
(1)  Preferred sites. New or expanded wet slip marinas and multi-family facilities shall be allowed at a density of up to 18 boat slips for every 100 feet of shoreline. Expansion of existing and construction of new dry storage facilities is allowed. Expansion of existing and construction of new boat ramps is allowed. 
(2)  Moderate development sites. New or expanded wet slips and multi-family facilities shall be allowed at a density of up to ten boat slips for every 100 feet of shoreline. Expansion of existing dry storage facilities is allowed. Construction of new dry storage facilities is prohibited. Expansion of existing boat ramps is allowed. Construction of existing boat ramps is allowed. Construction of new boat ramps is prohibited. 
(3)  Protected site. New or expanded wet slip marinas and multi-family facilities shall be allowed at a density of one boat slip for every 100 feet of shoreline. Expansion of existing dry storage facilities or construction of new dry storage facilities is prohibited. Expansion of existing boat ramp or construction of new boat ramps is prohibited. 
(4)  Mitigation. If a potential boat facility site is ranked as moderate or protected because of its proximity to a high use manatee area its ranking can be increased if slow speed zones are established that account for a significant portion of the expected travel route of the boats using the proposed facility. In that case, the manatee criteria in the three-way test (see Table 1) would not affect the outcome of the ranking. If such slow speed zones are not existing, the city or county may establish, with DEP approval, additional slow speed zones in order to mitigate the proposed additional boat traffic. 
(5)  Implementation. This rating system does not preclude the existing zoning and density regulations required by the current land development code. This system shall be used to determine the allowable maximum powerboat wet slip densities within future marina sites for the purpose of manatee protection. These criteria will be applied at the appropriate point in the city permitting process. 
(6)  Exemption. Existing facilities and facilities which had state or federal permits prior to adoption of the county manatee protection plan shall be exempt from these provisions, but will be subject to all other requirements of the LDC.
