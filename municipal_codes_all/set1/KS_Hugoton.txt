Only 18 days or 144 hours of compensatory time may be taken off in the calendar year. Any time accumulated in excess of the annual cap shall be treated as overtime pay. Eligible city employees shall be allowed to take only 16 hours or two days of compensatory time off at a time.

An employee who has earned compensatory time shall be allowed to use that time within a reasonable period of time after requesting its use. The employer is permitted to deny a request to use compensatory time at any time, if the employee's absence would impose an unreasonable burden on the employer's ability to provide adequate services to the public. A mere inconvenience to the employer is not sufficient reason to deny the use of compensatory time.

Any hours actually worked in excess of the 12 hours credited on-call time for weekends and after office hours during the week or in excess of six hours credited on-call time for holidays shall be eligible for additional overtime or compensatory time.  The on-call employee is required to check the water wells, record the well readings, and check the sewer plant each day of weekend or holiday on-call.

                                    (c) The outside utilities supervisor and electric system supervisor shall make an on-call schedule for their employees for the weekends and holidays.  In the event of a call-out, the on-call employee shall call in appropriate personnel and shall remain on site and participate in the repairs.  Employees with expertise in the problem areas should be called first.  All employees called are expected to respond unless they are physically unable to do so.  Those employees failing to respond, who are physically able, are subject to repreimand.  For long repairs, for multiple repairs, or in the case of inclement weather, the on-call employee shall contact the applicable supervisor.  Once so informed, the supervisor shall coordinate employees in order to ensure the repairs are made safely, to avoid long exposure of the employees to the elements, and to make sure all repairs are made quickly and efficiently.  The supervisor will maintain contact with the on-call employee by being at the job site or by phone until the repair is completed.  Where applicable, the supervisor will inspect all repairs before they are covered up. 
                                    (d) In any other cases of credit for on-call time, the applicable supervisor shall provide the on-call employee with equivalent time off during the work week.  When called in, only hours actually worked in excess of the equivalent time provided shall be eligible for overtime or compensatory time.

                                    (e) The time an employee takes his or her vacation shall be determined by the supervisor and employee. The supervisor will make every effort to accommodate the employees' requested dates. However, the needs of the city to provide adequate public services must come first in scheduling vacation time. Supervisors can block out periods of time from vacation leave during critical times, due to the seasonal nature required to perform certain tasks or due to the heavy workload during certain times of the year. Any conflicts in requested dates will be resolved by seniority of employment. Employees shall follow scheduled vacations filed and accepted by their respective supervisors on or before April 15thof each year.
                                    (f) All vacations shall be taken at the minimum rate of five days at a time.

                                    (g) For the first two years of employment, vacation time is computed on the anniversary date of each employee. Anniversary date is defined as that date an employee commences to work for the city. As of the first of the year following the employee's second anniversary date, employees are eligible to use vacation time as of the first of the year.
                                    (h) If an employee terminates his or her employment in good standing or upon the retirement or death of an employee, any vacation time owed will be computed on the basis of one hundred percent (100%) for the calendar year and any unused portion thereof shall be paid to the employee or their estate as part of the final payroll check. No unused vacation pay shall be allowed to any employee whose employment is terminated for any reason between the first and second anniversary dates of employment.

                                    December 25                                      Christmas Day

                        (except when another date is mutually agreeable between the supervisor and the employee)
                                    (b) In compliance with federal and state legislation supporting the Monday holiday schedule, the above holidays will be set up by the year on the Monday holiday schedule where feasible.

1-624.  SICK LEAVE. (a) When an employee is sick and cannot report for work, he or she must call his or her supervisor immediately preceding normal working hours. Such a courtesy enables the supervisor to make the necessary arrangements to continue the employee's functions while he or she is absent. Failure to notify the supervisor will not allow the employee to count the day as sick leave, but will count as an unpaid absence.
                                    (b) Each full-time employee shall be allowed three-fourths day sick leave for every month of continuous employment. Such sick leave shall be accumulative from year-to-year to a maximum of 90 days. Such accumulation shall not apply to part-time and temporary employees, until the six-months probationary period has expired, at which time such employee shall be credited with four and one-half days sick leave.
                                    (c) No sick leave exceeding two days shall be allowed unless, upon request, the employee furnishes to his/her immediate supervisor within 24 hours after he or she returns to work a written statement from a physician; certifying that his or her illness prevented the employee from working and that the employee is physically able to return to work.
                                    (d) Any employee receiving sick leave time preceding and/or following any holiday or weekend may be required at the request of his or her supervisor, to furnish a written statement from a physician certifying that his or her sickness prevented the employee from working.
                                    (e) Following any serious injury or serious illness, an employee shall be required to take a complete physical examination and to furnish a written report thereof to his or her immediate supervisor. Before returning to work after a serious injury or serious illness, the employee must provide to his or her immediate supervisor written authorization from a physician approving the return to work and noting any restrictions.
                                    (f) In the event of serious injury or illness of a member of the immediate family (spouse, children, parents, grandchildren, grandparents, brothers and sisters) of an employee which requires hospitalization, locally or away from home, the time necessary for the employee to be away from his or her employment shall be charged against his or her accumulated sick leave.
                                    (g) An employee who has exhausted all earned sick leave may, subject to authorization from his or her immediate supervisor, use any unused vacation time or any accumulated compensatory time during an illness and/or be allowed time off without pay.
                                    (h) Any employee, whose employment is terminated for any reason other than retirement or death, shall not receive any compensation for the balance of any unused sick leave. Upon the retirement or death of an employee, he or she or his or her estate shall be entitled to compensation for any unused sick leave time up to the 90-day maximum, computed on the basis of 100 percent from the anniversary date of his or her employment and not on the basis of the calendar year. (Ord. 486; Code 2011)

1-625.  SHORT-TERM DISABILITY PAY POLICY. All regular city employees, who are unable to perform their duties due to a medical condition, may elect to receive short-term disability pay. A 42-calendar day elimination period from the employee's last day at work must expire prior to eligible employees receiving disability pay. Disability payments shall be a part of the regular city payroll and shall be equivalent to 70 percent of the employee's basic two-week remuneration. Disability payments shall end upon the employee's return to work or 180 calendar days from the employee's last day at work.
                                    Employees must have exhausted accrued sick leave, personal leave, vaction time, and compensatory time, in order to have the disability payments.  Time off for pregnancy shall not be eligible for short-term disability pay.  Such time off falls under the Family and Medical Leave Act.
(Code 2011)

1-626.  FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE. (a) The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) makes available to eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid,job-protected leave during a 12-month period beginning from the date of the commencement of an employee's first FMLA leave. To be eligible, the employee must have worked for the city for at least 12 months. The eligibility for leave applies equally to male and female employees.
                                    (b) Leave may be taken for the following reasons:
                                         (1) For the birth of an employee's child.
                                         (2) For the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care.
                                         (3) When the employee is needed to care for a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition.
                                         (4) When the employee is unable to perform the functions of his or her job due to a serious health condition including pregnancy limitations or complications.
                                    For the birth or placement of a child, the right to take FMLA leave expires at the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date of the birth or placement of the child. Spouses who both work for the city are limited to a total of 12 weeks of FMLA leave due to the birth or placement of a child or for the care of a sick parent. For serious health conditions, the employee shall be required to provide a medical certification signed by a health care provider. When the FMLA leave is to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent, the certification must include an estimate of the amount of time the employee will be needed to care for that person. The city may require periodic reports on the medical condition in question. Failure, to provide medical certification to justify absences from work under FMLA, may result in dismissal of the employee.
                                    (c) An employee is required to provide the city with at least 30 days advance written notice before taking FMLA leave if the need for leave is foreseeable. If 30 days notice is not practicable because of the lack of knowledge, or is not foreseeable due to a medical emergency, then notice must be given as soon as is practicable given the facts and circumstances of the situation. If the employee fails to provide 30 days notice and has no reasonable excuse for the delay, the city may delay the FMLA leave until 30 days after the date notice is provided. During the 12-week period of the FMLA leave, the city shall continue to pay the health insurance benefits for the employee. Vacation and sick leave shall not accrue to the employee during the time of the FMLA leave. The employee also shall not be eligible for holiday pay during the time of the FMLA leave.
                                    (d) Following leave for treatment of the employee's own serious medical condition, a medical release shall be required stating the employee is able to return to work and noting any restrictions.
                        (Code 2011)

1-627.  ACCIDENT LEAVE. (a) All city employees are insured against accidents or occupational diseases incurred as a result of their job. If an employee is injured on the job or contracts an occupational disease as a result of the job, as defined under the Workmen's Compensation Act, he or she must notify the employer within ten days. Failure to do so may preclude medical treatment from being paid by the workmen's compensation insurance carrier or by the city's health insurance carrier.
                                    (b) An injured worker is entitled to all medical services reasonably necessary to cure and relieve the worker from the effects of the injury or illness. Treatments beyond the initial diagnosis must be approved by the workmen's compensation carrier.
                                    (c) An employee injured on the job or who becomes ill from the job shall receive his or her regular salary until he or she is able to return to work or until workmen's compensation insurance benefits become effective, whichever event occurs first. The first compensation payment is normally due at the end of the 14th day of lost time. Injured workers are not entitled to compensation for the first week they are off work unless they lose three consecutive weeks. An injured employee is entitled to a weekly amount of 66 2/3 percent of his or her average weekly wage up to a maximum of 75 percent of the state's average weekly wage, subject to legislative change. Once an employee begins receiving workmen's compensation benefits, he or she may elect to also use any accumulated sick leave, vacation time, or compensatory time to remain on the city's payroll. At the employee's election, he or she may choose to turn over the workmen's compensation benefits check to the city. Such action shall enable the city employee to remain on the city's payroll without the loss of accumulated sick leave, vacation time, or compensatory time.
                                    (d) Before returning to work from accident leave, the city employee shall be required to provide a written release from a doctor stating the employee is able to return to work and noting any restrictions.
                                    (e) Accident leave shall not be allowed any employee if the injuries or illness are due to his or her own conduct on off-time activities or injuries or illness related to secondary employment.
                        (Ord. 591; Sec. 1; Code 2011)

1-628.  DEATH IN THE FAMILY. The following policy is hereby established for city employees requiring time off due to a death in the family.
                                    In the event of the death of a member of the family of an employee, up to three working days with pay may be allowed for travel time to and from the funeral services or to attend to personal matters relating to the death. The term "family", as herein, defined, shall include not only those persons of the immediate family but also the parents, grandparents, grandchildren, brothers and sisters of the employee's spouse. The use of the three-day maximum is subject to the approval of the employee's supervisor. Additional time off may be arranged, without pay or charged to an employee's sick leave, vacation time, or compensatory time, also subject to the approval of the employee's supervisor. (Ord. 659, Sec. 1; Code 2011)

1-629.  JURY DUTY. It is the civic obligation of each city employee to serve on a jury if he or she is called. While on jury duty, or while appearing as a legally-required witness, an employee shall receive full pay from the city in addition to any other fees received.
                                    (b) The supervisor shall require proof of jury service before allowing any time off and pay for jury duty.
                                    (c) Should the employee serve on a jury during his or her regular vacation period, no deduction from his or her straight time pay will be made, nor will it be increased.

(Ord. 486; Code 2011)

1-634.  DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES  The following types of disciplinary actions are officially recognized by the City:
                              (a)        Verbal Warning.  A verbal warning is an oral reprimand given to an employee by his or her supervisor or department head.  A record of the warning shall be recorded in the employees file.

                              (c)        Probation.  Probation is a trial period of a specific length of time during which an employee is required to fulfill a set of conditions, or to improve work performance, or to improve on the job behavior.  Failure to meet the probationary requirements may result in additional disciplinary actions.
                              (d)        Salary Reduction.  A salary reduction is the lowering of an employees rate of pay within the pay range to which the employees position is assigned.

1-635.  NOTICE TO TERMINATE EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS; HEARING. (a) All city employees, except the city clerk, outside utilities supervisor, electric system supervisor, chief of police, city inspector, city attorney, municipal judge, city treasurer, and assistant city clerk shall be obligated to give the city two weeks written notice in the event they desire to terminate their services. The city shall also be obligated to give such employee, beyond his or her probationary period, two weeks written notice in the event it desires to terminate the services of such employee for any reason other than for misconduct, in which event no notice is necessary to terminate such employment.
                                    (b) The city clerk, outside utilities supervisor, electric system supervisor, chief of police, city inspector, city attorney, municipal judge, city treasurer, and assistant city clerk shall be obligated to give the city one month's written notice in the event they desire to terminate their services. The city shall also be obligated to give such employee, beyond his or her probationary period, one month's written notice in the event it desires to terminate the services of such employee for any reason, other than for misconduct, in which event no notice is necessary to terminate such employment.

4-701.                          GENERAL PROVISIONS AND DEFINITIONS:  (a)  Approved storm water detention or retention plans are required for all new developments and new sites in existing developments according to the size of the site and the percentage of impervious surfaces as detailed in Section 4-702.
                                     (b)  A retention pond is intended to hold an amount of water at all times.  The pond is designed to have drainage leading to another location for overflow during periods of heavy rainfall and storm water runoff.
                                     (c)  A detention pond is a pond that temporarily hold water and allows discharge at a predetermined rate and allows infiltration or evaporation to help dispose of the water.  The pond is not filled with water except for  episodes of large amounts of rainfall.  The pond is designed to prevent flash flooding from storm water runoff.
                                     (d)  Local detention is defined as a detention pond or facility that provides storm water detention to serve an individual property or site.  Local detention facilities are constructed and maintained by the individual property owner.
                                     (e)  Regional retention is defined as a retention pond, facility, or system that provides storm water retention to serve multiple properties.  Regional retention facilities may be publicly-constructed retention ponds, privately-constructed retention ponds build to city standards, or the city's existing drainage system.  The city and the developer(s) will enter into an agreement for the construction, maintenance, and sharing of the associated costs of a regional retention facility.
                                     (f) Impervious surfaces prevent natural infiltration of rain water.  Such surfaces include but are not limited to rooftops and asphalt, concrete, brick and stone used as pavement for roads, sidewalks, driveways, and parking lots.
                                     (Ord 835, Section 1)

4-702.                          REQUIREMENTS: (a) The detention or retention requirements for all new developments shall be based on the size of the development and the percentage of impervious surfaces in the development area.  For those developments of sufficient size and above the limit of percentage of impervious surfaces, a drainage study by a professional engineer shall be required based on a 25-year storm event.
                                    (b)  It is not practicable to require on-site storm water detention or retention for sites under one acre.  However, the city's regional drainage system must be capable of safely and efficiently handing the addition storm water run off without impacting existing draining.  If not (as determined by the Outside Utilities Supervisor), the developer will be required to provide a drainage study indicating the improvements that would be required to handle the additional flow.  The developer shall then submit a proposal on how to pay for these improvements.  The amount of financial assistance (if any)provided by the city shall be determined by the city council.
                                    (c)  On-site detention or retention is not required for sites between one acre and two acres with less than 50% impervious surfaces.  However, the city's regional drainage system must be capable of safely and efficiently handling the additional storm water runoff without impacting existing drainage.  If not (as determined by the Outside Utilities Supervisor), the developer will be required to provide a drainage study indicating the improvements that would be required to handle the additional flow.  The developer shall then submit a proposal on how to pay for those improvements.  The amount of financial assistance (if any) provided by the city shall be determined by the city council.
                                   (d)  A drainage study prepared by a professional engineer, shall be required for sites between one acre and two acres with equal to or greater than 50% impervious surfaces.  The drainage study should indicate how the proposed development's drainage works with the city's existing system.  If the city's regional drainage system is capable of safely and efficiently handling the storm water runoff without impacting existing drainage, then no on-site detention will be required.  If the study's calculations, based on a 25-yr. storm event, indicate the city's existing regional drainage system is not adequate, the developer will be required to provide on-site detention to handle the additional flow or to enter into an agreement with the city to improve the city's regional drainage system.  If the city's regional system has to be improved, the agreement will include how the city and the developer may share the costs for those improvements.
                                   (e)  A drainage study, prepared by a professional engineer and based on a 25-year storm event, shall be required for all sited greater than 25 acres.  On-site detention shall be required for all sites greater than 25 acres unless regional retention is provided.
                                   (Ord. 835, Section 2)

4-704.                          APPROVAL: (a) For all sites with sufficient size and percentage of impervious surfaces requiring on-site detention or retention, the developer shall provide engineered, stamped site plans with elevations to the city inspector for his/her review.  The developer shall provide the city inspector with a drainage study and stamped engineered plans showing the storm water runoff after the development will not exceed the storm water runoff prior to the development based on a 25-year storm event.
                                    (b)  Before a building permit can be issued, the city inspector and/or outside utilities supervisor and city engineer (if deemed necessary) shall determine the adequacy of the developer's drainage report and plans for storm water detention or retention.

                                    (d) Encourage pilfering and theft;
                                    (e) Constitute a blighting influence upon the area in which they are located;
                                    (f) Constitute a fire hazard because they frequently block access for fire equipment to adjacent buildings and structures.  (Code 1991)
