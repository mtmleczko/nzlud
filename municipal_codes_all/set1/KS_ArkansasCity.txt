PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Arkansas City, Kansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the Prior Code, as supplemented through August 16, 2011, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Board of City Commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Prior Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER ORDINANCES CHT:1 CODE CD1:1 LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE LDC:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER ORDINANCES INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1 LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE INDEX LDCi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Paula B. Freeman, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Tamara L. Niles, City Attorney, Nickolaus Hernandez, City Manager, and Lesley Shook, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

    The following shall supplement the administration section in each of the following codes: International Building Code, International Residential Code for One- and Two-Family Dwellings (hereafter referred to as the International Residential Code), International Mechanical Code, International Plumbing Code, International Existing Building Code, and International Fuel Gas Code. Any reference to jurisdiction shall mean the City of Arkansas City, Kansas; any reference to the appointed authority shall mean the city manager (or his or her designee). 
(a)  Generally. 
(1)  Title. The regulations contained herein and contained in the codes adopted under Municipal Code Section 14-40, and the other provisions of this chapter, shall be known collectively as the "city building code," may be cited as such and are referred to in this chapter as "the code." 
(2)  Referenced codes and standards. Where differences occur between stated provisions of this chapter, and codes and standards adopted by reference, the stated provisions of this chapter shall apply. The provisions of the International Plumbing Code and the International Mechanical Code shall apply to the installation of the plumbing and mechanical systems, and shall be considered as the specific code. Plumbing Articles 25 through 32 and Mechanical Articles 12 through 24 of the International Residential Code shall be considered as general requirements. To the extent a conflict exists between the articles in the International Residential Code and the International Plumbing Code, the International Mechanical Code, and the International Fuel Gas Code, the International Residential Code as amended by the city shall apply. 
Exception: When enforcement of a code provision would violate the conditions of the listing of the equipment or appliance, the conditions of the listing and manufacturer's instructions shall apply. 
(3)  Electrical. The provisions of the National Electrical Code shall apply to the installation of electrical systems, including alterations, repairs, replacement, equipment, appliances, fixtures, fittings and appurtenances thereto. Provisions of Article 34 through Article 42 of the International Residential Code shall be considered as general requirements. To the extent a conflict exists between Article 34 through Article 42 of the International Residential Code and the National Electrical Code, the National Electrical Code as adopted and amended by the city shall apply. 
(4)  Private sewage disposal. Where provisions of the International Private Sewage Disposal Code are applicable, the same shall reference the Private Sewage Disposal section of the International Plumbing Code. 
(b)  Applicability; general. Where, in any specific case, different sections of this code specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. When there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable. The code enforcement officer (and his or her designee), is authorized and directed to enforce the provisions of this code, render interpretations, and adopt policies and procedures in order to clarify the application of the codes' provisions. Such interpretations and policies shall not have the effect of waiving requirements specifically provided for in this code. 
(c)  Permits. 
(1)  Contractor of responsibility; licensing; fees. On construction projects that have multiple trades, each permit must be applied for by and issued to each trade individually. All building, electrical, plumbing and mechanical contractors shall be licensed by the city, and identified on the permit application by name and license number. Fees shall be charged by full valuation of all work to be performed. 
(2)  Time limitation of application. An application for a permit for any proposed work shall be deemed to have been abandoned 180 days after the date of filing, unless such application has been pursued in good faith or a permit has been issued; except that the code enforcement officer is authorized to grant one or more extensions of time for additional periods not exceeding 90 days each. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. 
(3)  Validity of permit. The issuance or granting of a permit shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any provisions of this code or of any other ordinance of the city. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this code or other ordinance of the city shall not be valid. The issuance of a permit based on construction documents and other data shall not prevent the code enforcement officer from requiring the correction of errors in the construction documents and other data. The code enforcement officer also is authorized to prevent occupancy or use of the structure when it is in violation of this code or of any other ordinances of this city. 
(4)  Expiration. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work on the site authorized by such permit is commenced within 180 days after its issuance, or if the work authorized on the site by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 180 consecutive days. Work shall be deemed suspended or abandoned if no inspections for work completed have occurred within such 180-day period. The code enforcement officer is authorized to grant, in writing, one or more extensions of time, for periods of not more than 180 days each. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Upon expiration of such extended period, the applicant shall not proceed with any work on the site until such time as the applicant receives a new building permit, which will require the applicant to submit a new, complete building permit application, along with payment of all fees necessary. Any fee refund for the fees paid under the expired building permit shall be made pursuant to Section 108.6 of the International Building Code. 
(d)  Fees. 
(1)  Payment of fees. A permit shall not be valid until the fees as set by resolution of the board of city commissioners have been paid, nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, has been paid. 
(2)  Plan review fee. When submittal documents are required by this code, a nonrefundable plan review fee deposit shall be paid at the time of submitting those documents for plan review. Said plan review fee shall be 65 percent of the building permit fee, or actual costs for outsourced review may be charged. 
a.  After plan review is completed, a credit or debit shall be applied to the building permit as required. 
b.  The plan review fee is separate from and is in addition to the permit fee. 
c.  When submittal documents are incomplete or changed so as to require additional plan reviews, or when the project involves deferred submittal items, an additional plan review fee shall be paid. 
(3)  Building permit valuations. The building permit valuation shall be determined by the code enforcement officer based upon national valuation tables and/or other relevant documentation. Permit valuations shall include total value of work, including materials and labor, for which the permit is being issued, such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing, equipment and permanent systems. The applicant for the permit shall provide an estimated permit valuation at the time of application. If, in the opinion of the code enforcement officer, the valuation is underestimated, the permit shall be denied unless the applicant can provide detailed documentation to support such valuation. 
(4)  Investigation fees; work without a permit. 
a.  Investigation. Whenever any work for which a permit is required by this code has been commenced without first obtaining said permit, a special investigation shall be made before a permit may be issued for such work. 
b.  Fee. An investigation fee shall be paid by the person commencing the work, whether or not a permit is issued then or subsequently. 
c.  The payment of such investigation fee shall not exempt any person from compliance with all other provisions of this code, such as obtaining a permit, or from any penalty prescribed by law. 
(5)  Fee refunds. The code enforcement officer may authorize refunding of any fee which was paid or collected erroneously. 
a.  The code enforcement officer may authorize refunding of not more than 80 percent of the building permit fee paid when no work has been done under a permit issued in accordance with this code or when the building permit has expired. 
b.  The code enforcement officer may authorize refunding of not more than 80 percent of the plan review fee paid when an application for a permit for which a plan review fee has been paid is withdrawn or canceled before any plan reviewing is done. 
c.  The code enforcement officer shall not authorize a refund of any fee paid except upon written application filed by the original applicant not later than 180 days after the date of fee payment. 
(e)  Inspections. 
(1)  Generally. All construction or work for which a permit is required shall be subject to inspection by the code enforcement officer, and all such construction or work shall remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes until approved by the code enforcement officer. In addition, certain types of construction shall have continuous inspection as specified in International Building Code Article 17, entitled "Structural Tests and Special Inspections." 
(2)  Required inspections; rough inspections. 
a.  Temporary electric construction meter. This inspection is to be made after all wiring installations have been made as required in National Electrical Code Article 527, entitled "Temporary Installations," including specific installation requirements of Westar Energy or other local electric provider. 
b.  Zoning/building code setbacks. A location/elevation certification survey may be required prior to concrete placement. This wet stamp certification from a registered design professional must be available at rough inspections. 
c.  Trenches, footings, pads and caissons. This inspection is to be made after trenches are excavated, forms are erected and steel is in place, and prior to placement of concrete. Except as otherwise stated herein, the code enforcement officer shall perform all inspections required by this code. In some cases, this code requires on-site observation and a stamped written report by a registered design professional when plans call for drilled piers (caisson) construction or other specialty inspections. Observation of the preparation, reinforcement and placement shall be described in detail in the written report as prepared by a registered design professional retained by the permittee. 
d.  Third-party inspections. 
1.  Foundation walls and/or grade beams steel reinforcement. This inspection is to be made after all forms are erected and steel is in place, and prior to placement of concrete. The registered design professional of record may perform this inspection with prior approval of the code enforcement officer. 
2.  Damp-proofing of footing and foundation and/or grade beams of basement walls. The registered design professional of record may, with prior approval of the code enforcement officer, perform this inspection, which must be completed prior to backfilling. 
3.  Electrical; underground. Within a building, this inspection is to be made prior to backfilling and/or pouring concrete floor. 
4.  Water service line. This inspection is to be made prior to backfilling. Test and inspections shall be in accordance with International Plumbing Code Section 312.5. Water lines must be inspected by the code enforcement officer or, with his or her prior approval, third-party inspections on forms provided by the city. 
e.  Inspections in geologic hazard areas. At the completion of rough grading and/or foundation excavation, and prior to the construction of retaining walls, footings or bearing caissons, a soil engineer and/or an engineering geologist, within their respective fields of competency, shall inspect the site at the applicant's expense and render opinions, in writing, to the code enforcement officer concerning the soil and geologic conditions actually encountered, and that all known geologic hazards or constraints have been taken into account in the design of the facility. 
f.  Re-inspection. The permittee must pay a re-inspection fee for each inspection or re-inspection when such portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. 
1.  Re-inspection fees are not required the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this code, but instead shall apply to control the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready for such inspection or re-inspection. 
2.  Re-inspection fees may be assessed when the inspection record card is not posted or otherwise available on the work site, when the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the code enforcement officer. 
3.  In instances when re-inspection fees are assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid. A receipt of payment must be posted or available before receiving additional inspections. 
(f)  Certificate of occupancy. No building or structure shall be used or occupied and no change in the existing occupancy classification of a building or structure, or portion thereof, shall be made until the code enforcement officer has issued a certificate of occupancy. 
(g)  Temporary certificate of occupancy. 
(1)  Temporary occupancy. The code enforcement officer is hereby authorized to issue a temporary certificate of occupancy (TCO) before completion of the entire work covered by the permit, provided that such portion or portions shall be occupied safely and there will be no danger to the public. The code enforcement officer shall set a time period during which the TCO is valid. The full certificate of occupancy (CO) must be obtained prior to the expiration of the TCO. If the conditions of the TCO are not met and a CO is not obtained, the right to occupy immediately ceases and the premises must be vacated. 
(2)  Certificate of compliance. When permitted work is not designed for occupancy, upon proper project completion, the code enforcement officer shall issue a certificate stating that materials and products meet specified standards or that work was done in compliance with approved construction documents.

    Historic district means an area designated as an "historic district" by ordinance of the board of city commissioners and which may contain, within defined geographic boundaries, two or more historic structures or historic sites that are united historically or aesthetically by plan or physical development and which may have within its boundaries other structures or sites that, while not of such historic and/or architectural significance to be designated historic structures or historic sites, nevertheless contribute to the overall visual characteristics of the historic district. 
    Historic site means the location of a significant event, a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or a structure, whether standing, ruined or vanished, where the location itself possesses historic, cultural, or archeological value, regardless of the value of any existing structure.

(1)  Its character, interest, or value as part of the development, heritage, or cultural characteristics of the community, county, state, or country; 
(2)  Its location as a site of a significant local, county, state, or national event; 
(3)  Its identification with a person or persons who significantly contributed to the community, county, state, or country; 
(4)  Its embodiment of distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style valuable for the study of a period, type, method of construction, or use of materials; 
(5)  Its identification as the work of a master builder, designer, architect, or landscape architect whose individual work has influenced the development of the community, county, state, or country; 
(6)  Its embodiment of elements of design, detailing, materials, or craftsmanship that render it architecturally significant; 
(7)  Its embodiment of design elements that make it structurally or architecturally innovative; 
(8)  Its unique location or singular physical characteristics that make it an established or familiar visual feature; 
(9)  Its character as a particularly fine or unique example of a utilitarian structure, including, but not limited to farmhouses, gas stations, or other commercial structures, with a high level of integrity or architectural significance; and/or 
(10)  It has yielded or is likely to yield important historical or pre-historical information. 
(f)  Recommendations. Within 30 days after the close of the public hearing, if the board finds that the evidence submitted at the hearing meets the criteria for designation, it shall submit a recommendation to the board of city commissioners that the nominated historic structure, historic site or historic district meets the criteria for designation identified in this section. The recommendation shall be accompanied by the following information: 
(1)  Explanation of the integrity of the nominated historic structure, historic site or historic district as it relates to the criteria for designation identified in this article; 
(2)  Explanation of the significance of the nominated historic structure, historic site or historic district as it relates to the criteria for designation identified in this article;

(g)  Consideration of nominations by the board of city commissioners. The board of city commissioners shall, after receiving the recommendation from the board, either designate the historic structure, historic site or historic district or reject the recommendation. If the board of city commissioners makes the designation, it shall do so by ordinance. The board of city commissioners shall not designate any structure, site or district unless the designation meets the public purpose of this article. If the board of city commissioners chooses to reject the recommendation, it shall respond to the board with reasons for rejection of the nomination. The city clerk shall provide a copy of the designation ordinance by regular mail to the owner of record of the historic structure or historic site, or to the owners of record of all property within a nominated historic district. The failure of the city clerk to provide a copy of the designation ordinance to the owners of record does not nullify the designation ordinance.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any application for permit that complies with other ordinances will not be denied if more than 180 days have passed since a complete nomination form is presented to the city. 
(j)  Denial of designation. A determination by the historic preservation board that the nominated structure, site or district does not meet the criteria for designation shall be a final administrative decision that may be appealed to the board of city commissioners. Rejection of a recommendation for designation by the board of city commissioners shall be a final administrative decision. Nominations for structures, sites and districts which have been denied designation within the prior 12-month period will not be considered by the board. 
(k)  Amendment and rescission of designation. Designation may be amended or rescinded upon petition to the historic preservation board and compliance with the same procedure and according to the same criteria set forth herein for designation, except that designation cannot be amended or rescinded because of a change in owner's consent.

If the application for a certificate of appropriateness complies with the designation ordinance and the criteria for review in this section, the board must approve the certificate of appropriateness. The board may also approve the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness if the applicant agrees to meet specific conditions with regard to modifications to the proposed project so that it complies with the designation ordinance and the criteria for review in this section. Written notice of the approval of the application for a certificate of appropriateness, with conditions if applicable, shall be provided the applicant within seven working days following the determination and shall be accompanied by a certificate of appropriateness. 
(d)  Denial of a certificate of appropriateness. If the application for a certificate of appropriateness does not comply with the designation ordinance or the criteria for review in this section and the applicant does not agree to meet specific conditions with regard to modification to the proposed project so that it complies with the designation ordinance and the criteria for review in this section, the board must not approve the certificate of appropriateness. A denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the denial. The historic preservation board shall make recommendations to the applicant concerning changes, if any, in the proposed action that would cause the historic preservation board to reconsider its denial and shall confer with the applicant and attempt to resolve as quickly as possible the differences between the applicant and the historic preservation board. The applicant may resubmit an amended application that takes into consideration the recommendations of the historic preservation board. Written notice of the denial of the application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be provided the applicant within seven working days following the determination. 
(e)  Criteria for review. In considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the historic preservation board shall be guided by the following general standards in addition to the ordinance designating the historic structure, historic site or historic district: 
(1)  A property shall be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships. 
(2)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
(3)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, shall not be undertaken. 
(4)  Changes to a property that have occurred may be retained and preserved. 
(5)  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. 
(6)  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. 
(7)  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. 
(8)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. 
(9)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(Prior Code(2), § 2.52.050; Ord. No. 2012-02-4293, § 1, 2-21-2012) 
Sec. 38-50. - Fees and enforcement. 
(a)  Fees. Any application for historical designation or certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by such fee as shall be specified from time to time by resolution of the board of city commissioners. 
(b)  Civil action. Any person who willfully constructs, reconstructs, alters, restores, renovates, relocates, stabilizes, repairs or demolishes any historic structure or historic site or property within a historic district in violation of this article may be required to return the historic structure, historic site, or property to its appearance and setting prior to the violation. Only the city shall have the authority to bring an action to enforce the provisions of this article. In the event that the cost of returning the historic structure, historic site or property to its appearance or setting prior to the violation exceeds 50 percent of the value of the historic structure, historic site or property, the offender shall have the option of either returning the historic structure, historic site or property to its appearance and setting prior to the violation or paying to the city a dollar amount equivalent to the cost of reconstruction. This civil remedy shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any criminal prosecution and penalty. 
(c)  Appeal. Any decision made by the historic preservation board may be appealed to the board of city commissioners by filing written notice of appeal with the city clerk no more than ten days after a final decision is made by the board.

A right-of-way user shall not construct or reconstruct any of its facilities located upon, over, under or within the city right-of-way without first having submitted in writing a description of its planned improvement to the city engineer and having received a permit for such improvement. The city engineer may require that any drawings, plans or specifications submitted be certified by a professional engineer licensed to practice engineering by the State of Kansas stating that such drawings, plans and/or specifications comply with all applicable technical codes, rules and regulations, unless such plans are based directly on nationally recognized codes, which are appropriately cited, and attested to on the plans by the signature of an authorized official of the organization applying for the permit. 
(l)  Right-of-way users shall cooperate promptly and fully with the city and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete on-site information regarding the nature and horizontal and vertical location of its facilities located within the right-of-way, both underground and overhead, when requested by the city or its authorized agent for a public improvement. Such location and identification shall be at the sole expense of the right-of-way user without any expense to the city, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. 
(m)  The city shall have the authority to prohibit the use or occupancy of a specific portion of the right-of-way by a right-of-way user due to public health, safety or welfare considerations.

(e)  The appellant shall be afforded a hearing on the matter before the governing body within 30 days of filing the appeal.

No. 4159, § 1, 2008) 
Sec. 62-260. - Determination of amount of use. 
(a)  The amount of sewage discharged to the sewerage system of the city shall be determined by the quantity of water metered to the user. In the case of a single user whose water usage is measured by several meters, the total water usage for all the meters shall be the basis on which sewer service charges are computed and not on the basis of each separate meter reading. 
(b)  If a commercial or industrial user desires to establish eligibility for a sewage service volume base of less than 100 percent of monthly water usage he may at his sole expense: 
(1)  Install a sewage meter acceptable to the city to measure the volume of liquid actually discharged into the sewerage system from his premises. Such meter shall be maintained and calibrated by the user and the readings from the meter shall be taken at least twice weekly and shall be provided to the city on a monthly basis. In the event a sewage meter is installed, the charges as set forth in section 62-259 shall be applied to: 
a.  The volume of sewage entering the sewerage system as measured by the meter each month; or 
b.  A calculated volume based on the percentage of metered water usage discharged to the sewerage system as determined by the historical comparison of water usage and metered sewage. 
(2)  In lieu of a sewage meter, the user may: 
a.  Install auxiliary water meters to measure that portion of water used which is diverted from entering the sewerage system. In the event an auxiliary water meter is installed the volume of water metered by such meters shall be deducted from the total volume of water usage before the sewer service rate schedule is applied; or 
b.  Where the discharge of uncontaminated cooling water to the sewerage system is permitted by the city, such cooling water discharge shall be exempted from the volume rate in section 62-259(a) and, in lieu thereof, shall be charged a rate set by the board of city commissioners. The monthly quantity of cooling water discharged by a user shall be determined by auxiliary water metering as specified in this article or shall be estimated by the city based on the user's total monthly water usage less that user's average monthly water usage. All discharges other than uncontaminated cooling water shall remain subject to the volume rate in section 62-259(a). 
(c)  After the end of one year after adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, no refunds, allowances or reductions from the 100 percent water use base will be granted commercial or industrial users for any time period prior to approval of a sewage metering or diverted water metering system.

Sec. 62-261. - Determination of extra strength sewage. 
(a)  The city will perform analysis at intervals no greater than 12 months to determine the strength of sewage discharged by commercial and industrial users who discharge an annual average volume of 25,000 gallons or more of sewage per day and whose wastes are subject to extra strength charges. Industrial and commercial users who discharge an average of less than 25,000 gallons per day and whose wastes are subject to extra strength charges shall have their wastes analyzed as often as deemed necessary by the city to obtain representative samples. 
(b)  If any industrial or commercial user chooses not to accept the analytical determination made by the city, they may at their sole expense employ an independent laboratory, acceptable to the city, to conduct sampling and analysis of their sewage. The time period and location for the collection of the samples shall be designated by the city. The city and the independent laboratory shall both preside over the collection of the samples and shall equally divide the final composite so that duplicate analysis may be made. 
(c)  If results of the analysis of the sewage sample made by both the city and the independent laboratory are not comparable, the city may appoint a second independent laboratory to analyze the sewage. The sampling procedures used will be the same as those outlined above. The results of these analyses, together with the previous results shall be used to determine the actual extra strength charges. The fee for the second independent laboratory analysis shall be shared equally between the city and the user. 
(d)  If any industrial or commercial user improves the quality of their discharged sewage, the city will reevaluate the strength of the sewage if requested to do so by the user. The user will pay an additional monitoring charge for the necessary sampling and analysis. 
(e)  The city shall have the right to enter upon all premises served by the sewerage system of the city, for the purpose of inspecting, reading or otherwise examining all meters and appurtenances involved in the recording of water received on the premises or sewage discharged therefrom, or to collect samples for analysis of sewage discharged therefrom.

L.  "Telecommunication services" means providing the means of transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user's choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received. 
Sec. 2. - Grant of contract franchise. 
A.  There is hereby granted to Grantee this nonexclusive Contract franchise to construct, maintain, extend and operate its Facilities along, across, upon or under any Public right-of-way for the purpose of supplying Telecommunication services to the consumers or recipients of such service located within the corporate boundaries of the City, for the term of this Contract franchise, subject to the terms and conditions of this Contract franchise. 
B.  The grant of this Contract franchise by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the Public right-of-way, and shall give only the right to occupy the Public right-of-way, for the purposes and for the period stated in this Contract franchise. This Contract franchise does not: 
1.  Grant the right to use Facilities or any other property, telecommunications related or otherwise, owned or controlled by the City or a third-party, without the consent of such party; 
2.  Grant the authority to construct, maintain or operate any Facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the City outside of the Public right-of-way, specifically including, but not limited to, parkland property, City Hall property or public works facility property. 
3.  Excuse Grantee from obtaining appropriate access or attachment agreements before locating its Facilities on the Facilities owned or controlled by the City or a third-party. 
C.  As a condition of this grant, Grantee is required to obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the FCC or the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC).

D.  Grantee shall not provide any additional services for which a franchise is required by the City without first obtaining a separate franchise from the City or amending this Contract franchise, and Grantee shall not knowingly allow the use of its Telecommunications Facilities by any third party in violation of any federal, state or local law. In particular, this Contract franchise does not provide Grantee the right to provide cable service as a cable operator (as defined by 47 USC 522 (5)) within the City. Grantee agrees that this franchise does not permit it to operate an open video system without payment of fees permitted by 47 USC 573(c)(2)(B) and without complying with FCC regulations promulgated pursuant to 47 USC 573. 
E.  This authority to occupy the Public right-of-way shall be granted in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis and not in conflict with state or federal law. 
Sec. 3. - Use of public right-of-way. 
A.  Pursuant to K.S.A. 17-1902, and amendments thereto, and subject to the provisions of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall have the right to construct, maintain and operate it Facilities along, across, upon and under the Public right-of-way. Such Facilities shall be so constructed and maintained as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on such public ways or obstruct the legal use by other utilities. 
B.  Grantee's use of the Public right-of-way shall always be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety and welfare requirements and regulations of the City. The City may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the Public right-of-way provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory. 
C.  Grantee shall participate in the Kansas One Call utility location program. 
D.  If requested by City, in order to accomplish construction and maintenance activities directly related to improvements for the health, safety, and welfare of the public, SBC Kansas shall remove its facilities from the public right of way or shall relocate or adjust its facilities within the public right of way at no cost to the City. Such relocation or adjustment shall be completed as soon as reasonably possible within the time set forth in any request by the City for such relocation or adjustment. Any damages suffered by the City or its contractors as a result of SBC Kansas' failure to timely relocate or adjust its facilities shall be borne by SBC Kansas. 
E.  Permission is hereby granted to SBC Kansas to trim trees upon and overhanging streets, alleys, sidewalks and public places of said city so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with SBC Kansas' facilities, all the said trimming shall comply with all applicable laws, statutes and/or ordinances. 
Sec. 4. - Compensation to the city. 
A.  Compensation made pursuant to this Contract franchise shall be paid on a quarterly basis without invoice or reminder from the City and paid no later than forty-five (45) days after the end of the remittal period. For the first year of this Contract franchise, said compensation shall be a sum equal to $2.00 per access line per month. Thereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of the Contract franchise shall continue to be based on a sum equal to $2.00 per access line per month; unless the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety (90) days before the end of the calendar year that it intends to increase or decrease the applicable franchise fee or that it intends to switch to an access line or a gross receipts fee (said gross receipts fee shall be at a rate of five (5) percent) for the following calendar year. In the event the City elects to change its basis of compensation, nothing herein precludes the City from switching its basis of compensation back provided the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year. 
B.  Beginning January 1, 2004, and every 36 months thereafter, the City, subject to the public notification procedures set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001 (m), and amendments thereto, may elect to adopt an increased Access line fee or gross receipts fee subject to the provisions and maximum fee limitations contained in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto, or may choose to decline all or any portion of any increase in the Access line fee. 
C.  If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the applicable statutory interest rate. 
D.  Upon written request by the City, but no more than once per quarter, Grantee shall submit to the City either a 9K2 (gross receipts) or 9KN (access lines) statement showing the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated. 
E.  No acceptance by the City of any franchise fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any franchise fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the City. Any dispute concerning the amount due under this Section shall be resolved in the manner set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto. 
F.  The City shall have the right to examine, upon written notice to Grantee no more often than once per calendar year, those records necessary to verify the correctness of the franchise fees paid by Grantee.

The franchise fee is compensation for use of the Public right-of-way and shall in no way be deemed a tax of any kind. 
H.  Grantee shall remit a franchise fee to the City on those Access lines that have been resold to another telecommunications local exchange service provider, but in such case the City shall not collect a franchise fee from the reseller service provider and shall not require the reseller service provider to enter a contract franchise ordinance. 
Sec. 5. - Indemnity and hold harmless. 
    It shall be the responsibility of Grantee to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Public right-of-way from harm or damage. If Grantee fails to accurately or timely locate Facilities when requested, in accordance with the Kansas Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act, K.S.A. 66-1801 et seq., it has no claim for costs or damages against the City and its authorized contractors unless such party is responsible for the harm or damage by its negligence or intentional conduct. The City and its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations and observing marker posts when working near Grantee's Facilities. 
    Grantee shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of Grantee, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate or subcontractor of Grantee, or its respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representatives, while installing, repairing or maintaining Facilities in the Public right-of-way. 
    The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors. If Grantee and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this state without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law. This section is solely for the benefit of the City and Grantee and does not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity. 
    Grantee or City shall promptly advise the other in writing of any known claim or demand against Grantee or the City related to or arising out of Grantee's activities in the Public right-of-way. 
Sec. 6. - Insurance requirement. 
A.  During the term of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage at its sole expense, with financially reputable insurers that are licensed to do business in the state of Kansas. Should Grantee elect to use the services of an affiliated captive insurance company for this purpose, that company shall possess a certificate of authority from the Kansas Insurance Commissioner. Grantee shall provide not less than the following insurance: 
1.  Workers' compensation as provided for under any worker's compensation or similar law in the jurisdiction where any work is performed with an employers' liability limit equal to the amount required by law. 
2.  Commercial general liability, including coverage for contractual liability and products completed operations liability on an occurrence basis and not a claims made basis, with a limit of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) combined single limit per occurrence for bodily injury, personal injury, and property damage liability. The City shall be included as an additional insured with respect to liability arising from Grantee's operations under this Contract franchise. 
3.  As an alternative to the requirements of subsection (a), Grantee may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that it is self-insured and as such Grantee has the ability to provide coverage in an amount not less than one millions dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence and two million dollars (2,000,000.00) in aggregate, to protect the City from and against all claims by any person whatsoever for loss or damage from personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occasioned by Grantee, or alleged to so have been caused or occurred. 
Sec. 7. - Revocation and termination. 
    In case of failure on the part of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise, or if Grantee should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall forfeit all rights, privileges and franchise granted herein, and all such rights, privileges and franchise hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, and this Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked or terminated, provided that said revocation or termination, shall not take effect until the City has completed the following procedures: Before the City proceeds to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, it shall first serve a written notice upon Grantee, setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and Grantee shall have sixty (60) days thereafter in which to comply with the conditions and requirements of this Contract franchise. If at the end of such sixty (60) day period the City deems that the conditions have not been complied with, the City shall take action to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise by an affirmative vote of the City Council present at the meeting and voting, setting out the grounds upon which this Contract franchise is to be revoked and terminated; provided, to afford Grantee due process, Grantee shall first be provided reasonable notice of the date, time and location of the City Council's consideration, and shall have the right to address the City Council regarding such matter. Nothing herein shall prevent the City from invoking any other remedy that may otherwise exist at law. Upon any determination by the City Council to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, Grantee shall have thirty (30) days to appeal such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction. This Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked and terminated at the end of this thirty (30) day period, unless Grantee has instituted such an appeal. If Grantee does timely institute such an appeal, such revocation and termination shall remain pending and subject to the court's final judgment. Provided, however, that the failure of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise or the doing or causing to be done by Grantee of anything prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise shall not be a ground for the revocation or termination thereof when such act or omission on the part of Grantee is due to any cause or delay beyond the control of Grantee or to bona fide legal proceedings. 
Sec. 8. - Reservation of rights. 
A.  The City specifically reserves its right and authority as a customer of Grantee and as a public entity with responsibilities towards its citizens, to participate to the full extent allowed by law in proceedings concerning Grantee's rates and services to ensure the rendering of efficient Telecommunications service and any other services at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of Grantee's property in good repair. 
B.  In granting its consent hereunder, the City does not in any manner waive its regulatory or other rights and powers under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Kansas as the same may be amended, its Home Rule powers under the Constitution of the State of Kansas, nor any of its rights and powers under or by virtue of present or future ordinances of the City. 
C.  In granting its consent hereunder, Grantee does not in any manner waive its regulatory or other rights and powers under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Kansas as the same may be amended, or under the Constitution of the State of Kansas, nor any of its rights and powers under or by virtue of present or future ordinances of the City. 
D.  In entering into this Contract franchise, neither the City's nor Grantee's present or future legal rights, positions, claims, assertions or arguments before any administrative agency or court of law are in any way prejudiced or waived. By entering into the Contract franchise, neither the City nor Grantee waive any rights, but instead expressly reserve any and all rights, remedies, and arguments the City or Grantee may have at law or equity, without limitation, to argue, assert, and/or take any position as to the legality or appropriateness of any present or future laws, non-franchise ordinances, (e.g. the City's right-of-way ordinance referenced in Section 3b of this Contract franchise) and/or rulings. 
Sec. 9. - Failure to enforce. 
    The failure of either the City or the Grantee to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this Contract franchise shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver or relinquishment shall be deemed to have been made by the City or the Grantee unless said waiver or relinquishment is in writing and signed by both the City and the Grantee. 
Sec. 10. - Term and termination date. 
A.  This Contract franchise shall be effective for a term of three (3) years from the effective date of this Contract franchise. Thereafter, this Contract franchise will renew for additional three (3) year terms, unless either party notifies the other party of its intent to terminate the Contract franchise at least one hundred and eighty (180) days before the termination of the then current term. The additional term shall be deemed a continuation of this Contract franchise and not as a new franchise or amendment. 
B.  Upon written request of either the City or Grantee, this Contract franchise shall be renegotiated at any time in accordance with the requirements of state law upon any of the following events: changes in federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or orders that materially affect any rights or obligations of either the City or Grantee, including but not limited to the scope of the Contract franchise granted to Grantee or the compensation to be received by the City hereunder. 
C.  If any clause, sentence, section, or provision of K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto, shall be held to be invalid by a court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, provided such order is not stayed, either the City or Grantee may elect to terminate the entire Contract franchise. In the event of such invalidity, if Grantee is required by law to enter into a Contract franchise with the City, the parties agree to act in good faith in promptly negotiating a new Contract franchise. 
D.  Amendments under this Section, if any, shall be made by contract franchise ordinance as prescribed by statute. This Contract franchise shall remain in effect according to its terms, pending completion of any review or renegotiation provided by this section. 
E.  In the event the parties are actively negotiating in good faith a new contract franchise ordinance or an amendment to this Contract franchise upon the termination date of this Contract franchise, the parties by written mutual agreement may extend the termination date of this Contract franchise to allow for further negotiations. Such extension period shall be deemed a continuation of this Contract franchise and not as a new contract franchise ordinance or amendment. 
Sec. 11. - Point of contact and notices. 
    Grantee shall at all times maintain with the City a local point of contact who shall be available at all times to act on behalf of Grantee in the event of an emergency.

SECTION 1-7 OFFICIAL ZONING DISTRICT MAP
1-701.
a. Adoption. The boundaries of the Zoning Districts established by these
Regulations are shown on a map or series of maps designated the
Official Zoning District Map of Arkansas City, Kansas, and as amended
from time to time. The Official Zoning District Map, including all notations,
references, data and other information shown on the Official Zoning
District Map, is adopted and made a part of these Regulations as fully as if
it were included in the pages of these Regulations. The Official Zoning
District Map shall be maintained by the Zoning Administrator, in
accordance with K.S.A. 12-753. In the case of any dispute regarding the
zoning classification of property subject to these Regulations, the original
maps maintained by the Zoning Administrator shall govern. The Zoning
Administrator is responsible for producing all updates of the Official Zoning
District Map.
b. Floodplain Maps. The Floodplain (FP) District is established in Article
28. The Floodplain District will be shown and identified on the Official
Zoning District Map of the City. The Floodplain Maps, which are
maintained by the Zoning Administrator, shall be read in conjunction with
the Official Zoning District Map for areas lying within Regulatory
Floodways and Regulatory Floodway Fringes. The Floodplain
management regulations found in Article 28 apply in addition to the Base
District zoning regulations for areas within the Regulatory Floodway.
Regulatory Floodway and Regulatory Floodway Fringe boundaries are the
same as provided by the Federal Insurance Administration on the Cowley
County, Kansas and Incorporated Area Flood Insurance Rate Maps and in
the Flood Insurance Study. Actual ground location of Regulatory Floodway
and Regulatory Floodway Fringe boundaries shall be verified by the
developer by field survey using the reference marks and/or vertical
controls provided by the Federal Insurance Administration study.

District Map, district boundaries follow lot lines, the center lines of streets
or alleys or the specified distance from such features, railroad right-of-way
lines, or lot lines.
d. Interpretation of Zoning District and Floodplain Boundaries.
(1) Where uncertainty exists about the boundaries of a zoning district,
or when the street or property existing on the ground is at variance
with that shown on the Official Zoning District Map, the Zoning
Administrator is authorized to determine the location of such
1-5
boundaries. The Zoning Administrator's interpretation may be
appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(2) Where interpretation of Regulatory Floodway or Regulatory
Floodway Fringe District boundaries is unclear or disputed, the
Zoning Administrator will make the necessary interpretation. The
Zoning Administrators interpretation may be appealed to the Board
of Zoning Appeals. The Regulatory Flood elevation for the point in
question will be the governing factor in locating the boundary.
SECTION 1-8 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS
1-801.
a. Conflict with State or Federal Regulations. If the provisions of these
Regulations are inconsistent with those of the State or Federal
government, the more restrictive provision will control, to the extent
permitted by law. The more restrictive provision is the one that imposes
greater development restrictions or more stringent controls. Nothing in
these Regulations shall be interpreted as requiring a violation of State or
Federal law.
b. Conflict with Other City Regulations. If the provisions of these
Regulations are inconsistent with one another, or if they conflict with other
City regulations, the more restrictive provision will control. The more
restrictive provision is the one that imposes greater development
restrictions or more stringent controls.
c. Conflict with Private Agreements and Covenants. These Regulations
are not intended to abrogate, annul, or otherwise interfere with any
easement, covenant, or other private agreement or legal relationship
otherwise in conformance with these Regulations.
SECTION 1-9 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
1-901.
a. Violations Continue. Any violation of the previous zoning regulations of
the City will continue to be a violation under these Regulations and will be
subject to penalties and enforcement under Article 30 unless the use or
development activity is consistent with the express terms of these
Regulations, in which case enforcement action will cease, except to the
extent of collecting penalties for violations that occurred before the
effective date. The adoption of these Regulations does not affect nor
1-6
prevent any pending or future prosecution of, or action to abate, violations
of the previous City laws that occurred prior to the effective date.
b. Applications Submitted Before the Effective Date. Any use or
development activity for which a complete application was submitted to
the City before the effective date and pending approval on the effective
date may, at the applicants option, be reviewed wholly under the terms of
the City's zoning laws in effect immediately before the effective date. If
approved, such uses or development activities may be carried out in
accordance with the standards in effect at the time of application. Any reapplication
for an expired permit shall meet the standards in effect at the
time of re-application.
c. Permits Issued Before the Effective Date. Any use or development
activity for which a permit was duly issued before the effective date may
be completed in conformance with the issued permit and other applicable
permits and conditions, and such regulations that were in effect at the time
the permit was issued, even if such use or development activity does not
fully comply with provisions of these Regulations. If the use or
development activity is not commenced or completed in accordance with
the applicable permit terms, the City may, upon receipt of a written request
and payment of the required fee, grant one 6-month time extension. If the
use or development activity is not commenced or completed within the
time allowed under the original permit or any extension granted, then the
use or development activity may be completed or occupied only in
compliance with the requirements of these Regulations.
SECTION 1-10 SEVERABILITY
1-1001. If any portion of these Regulations is held to be invalid or
unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, that portion held to be
invalid or unconstitutional is to be deemed severed from these Regulations, and
in no way will affect the validity of any other portion of these Regulations.

SECTION 3-4 RULES WHERE UNCERTAINTY MAY ARISE
3-401. It is the intent of these regulations that every part of the incorporated area
of the City of Arkansas City, other than streets, highways and railroad lines, shall
be included in one of the zoning districts established herein. The boundaries of
the specific zoning districts are to scale on the zoning map and are to be
interpreted by the corresponding measurements on the map. The following rules
shall apply in the determination of the boundaries of any district shown on the
Zoning Map.
a. Whenever a lot is divided by a zoning district boundary, the zoning
regulations applicable within each district shall apply equally to each
portion of the lot situated in a separate district. The dimensions of the
zoning district(s) on the lot shall be determined by scaled measurements
of the zoning district boundaries on the Zoning Map.
b. Where boundaries approximate blocks and lots, street and alley lines or
other identifiable property or boundary lines, such lines shall be construed
to be the district boundary. Where such boundaries are shown as being
within street and alley lines or within identifiable rights-of-way or
waterways, the centerline thereof shall be construed to be the district
boundary.
c. Where a district boundary divides an unsubdivided parcel, the location of
the district boundary shall be determined by the use of the scale
appearing on the Zoning Map unless indicated by dimensions.
d. Map codes or symbols indicating the classification of property on the
Zoning Map apply to the entire area within the district boundaries.
e. Where a street, alley or right-of-way is lawfully vacated or abandoned, the
zoning designation of the abutting property shall apply to the centerline of
the vacated or abandoned street, alley or right-of-way.
f. Should any uncertainty remain about the location or meaning of a
boundary indicated on the Zoning Map, the uncertainty shall be resolved
by the Zoning Administrator, whose decision may be appealed to the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
SECTION 3-5 VARIANCES AND EXCEPTIONS REQUIRED
3-501. Except as hereinafter provided for by variance or exception granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals as specifically authorized by these regulations:

district in which the building is located.
d. The minimum yards and other open spaces required by these zoning
regulations for each and every building existing at the time of passage of
these zoning regulations or for any building hereafter erected shall not be
encroached upon or considered as yard or open space requirements for
any other building, nor shall any lot area be reduced beyond the district
requirements of these zoning regulations.
SECTION 3-6 VIOLATIONS CONTINUE
3-601. Violations Continue. Any violation of the previous City zoning or
subdivision regulations shall continue to be a violation under these regulations
and shall be subject to penalties and enforcement, unless the use, development,
construction or other activity is consistent with the express terms of these
regulations, in which case enforcement action shall cease, except to the extent of

SECTION 4-1 A AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT
4-101. It is the intent of the A District to preserve and protect agricultural uses
and resources by regulating density and land use. The district is not intended to
serve the homeowner who lives on a small suburban lot, but is designed to
accommodate agricultural operations on substantial acreage. Intense urban
usage is usually premature and undesirable in the A District, due to lack of
infrastructure. Uses within this district are mostly related to agricultural activities.
Uses that might have nuisance characteristics, if intermingled in developed
residential areas, are permitted on the basis that they are no more offensive than
normal agricultural uses.
4-2
SECTION 4-2 R-1 LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
4-201. The intent of the R-1 District is to provide primarily for one-family
dwellings with accommodation for two-family dwellings and related residential
uses such as churches and certain public uses which tend to be located at the
edge of higher density, and more centrally located residential areas. The district
is intended to accommodate a low population density for specified types of
dwelling units on large to medium sized lots with emphasis on adequate open
space around buildings.
SECTION 4-3 R-2 MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
4-301. The intent of the R-2 District is to provide for one- and two-family
dwellings with some accommodations for three-plus family dwellings as
conditional uses and also related residential uses and certain public uses. This
district allows for a moderate density for these types of dwelling units.
SECTION 4-4 R-3 HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
4-401. The intent of the R-3 District is to provide for a full range of dwelling units,
from one-family to apartments and for related residential and certain public uses.
This district is located primarily where moderate to high residential density will be
compatible with surrounding uses and development patterns.
SECTION 4-5 CS COUNTRYSIDE DISTRICT
4-501. The intent of the CS District is to provide area to accommodate a rural
residential lifestyle, with limited future residential development which will provide
adequate open space even after full development. The district is intended for
one-family detached dwellings and limited related residential and agricultural
uses.
SECTION 4-6 MHS MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION DISTRICT
4-601. The intent of the MHS District is to provide area for low-density
manufactured housing, recognizing the need and demand for alternative housing
choices. This district also recognizes that alternative housing types often
function best, and maintain optimum property value, when part of a well-planned
4-3
development. It is intended that this district be established to accommodate
manufactured homes on permanent foundations where lots are owned by
manufactured home owners.
SECTION 4-7 MP MANUFACTURED HOME PARK DISTRICT
4-701. The intent of the MP District is to provide manufactured home park
developments which are compatible with the character of the surrounding
neighborhood in which they are located. Manufactured home parks are
residential uses and should be located in areas where services and amenities
are available such as those found in areas comprised of site-built housing. This
district is intended for those areas where the owner proposes to develop and rent
or lease individual manufactured home sites.
SECTION 4-8 EH-O ELDERLY HOUSING OVERLAY DISTRICT
4-801. The intent of the EH-O District is to provide area for, and otherwise
encourage, housing and related facilities developed for independent living
opportunities for senior citizens.
SECTION 4-9 C-O COLLEGE OVERLAY DISTRICT
4-901. The intent of the C-O District is to provide for the use of Cowley College
as a special zoning district where development may occur in conformance with
an approved master development plan, if the College elects to present one. This
is an overlay district intended to be used only with R-3 or P as the underlying
district.
SECTION 4-10 C-1 OFFICE AND SERVICE BUSINESS DISTRICT
4-1001. The intent of the C-1 District is to provide for areas for public, quasipublic,
institutional, social, philanthropic organizations or societies, professional
service and office types of uses, as well as for retail sales and services. Density
and intensity of use may be considered moderate. This zone is primarily used to
allow for non-residential uses which provide a direct service to the total
community and still be compatible with adjoining residential districts.
SECTION 4-11 C-2 RESTRICTED COMMERCIAL DISTRICT
4-1101. The intent of the C-2 District is to provide for areas of convenient
shopping facilities located to serve one or more residential neighborhoods. The
4-4
types of uses permitted include the basic retail, office and service uses that are
customarily located in a shopping center.
SECTION 4-12 C-3 GENERAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICT
4-1201. The intent of the C-3 District is to allow basic retail, service and office
uses located at specific points on major streets outside the central and
neighborhood business districts. This district is also intended to provide
locations for commercial activities that do not require a central location
downtown, but do require a location easily accessible to downtown shoppers,
therefore it is particularly appropriate adjoining a major highway. Business uses
needing large floor areas, particularly those of a service nature, not compatible
with Central Business District uses, are included in this district.
SECTION 4-13 C-4 CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT
4-1301. The intent of the C-4 District is to encourage the location of major
business services and retail business activity in the central business district in
order to maintain that area as the core retail, government and entertainment
district for the community. The intent is also to encourage residential use in the
C-4 District under terms and conditions where such use complements
commercial uses.
SECTION 4-14 I-1 LIGHT INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
4-1401. The intent of the I-1 District is primarily to provide locations for those
manufacturing industries and related industrial activities in which the production
performance of the manufacturing industries characteristically produces a
finished product which is generally produced from semi-finished materials and
requires little or no outside material storage. The effect of the production process
upon surrounding areas is normally that of traffic generated by the receipt and
delivery of materials and goods and traffic generated by employees. The District
is not intended to create obnoxious noise, glare, dust or odor or create intensive
lot or land coverage. Commercial uses permitted in this district are generally
those which serve the convenience of industrial establishments and their
employees.
SECTION 4-15 I-2 HEAVY INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
4-1501. The intent of the I-2 District is to provide locations for basic or primary
industries and related industrial activities. Many of these industries
characteristically store bulk quantities of raw or scrap materials for processing to
4-5
semi-finished products. Commercial uses permitted in this district are generally
those which serve the convenience of industrial establishments and their
employees. Certain obnoxious or hazardous uses are allowed only upon the
issuance of a conditional use permit.
SECTION 4-16 P PUBLIC USE DISTRICT
4-1601. The intent of the P District is to provide locations for public ownership
that are used for major public facilities.
SECTION 4-17 MU MIXED USE DISTRICT
4-1701. The intent of the MU District is to encourage compatible mixed use
residential and commercial uses of low to moderate intensity, complementing
neighborhood residential areas with high quality development and urban design
standards.
SECTION 4-18 PUD-O PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY
DISTRICT
4-1801. The intent of the PUD Overlay District is to encourage innovation in
residential, commercial and industrial development by allowing greater variety in
type, design, and layout of buildings; to encourage a more efficient use of land
reflecting changes in the technology of land development; to encourage the
expansion of urban areas incorporating the best features of modern design while
conserving the value of land; and to provide a procedure which relates the type,
design, and layout of development to the particular site and the particular
demand at the time of development in a manner consistent with the preservation
of property values within established neighborhoods.
SECTION 4-19 FP-O FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT DISTRICT
4-1901. The intent of the Floodplain Management Overlay District is to protect
public health, safety and welfare by minimizing loss of life and property in areas
subject to flooding.
SECTION 4-20 HO-O HOUSING OPPORTUNITY OVERLAY DISTRICT
4-2001. The intent of the HO-O District is to encourage the development or
redevelopment of residential lots in the older areas of the City, where lots contain
less area and have less frontage than required in new residential districts.
4-6
SECTION 4-21 HC-O HISTORIC CONSERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT
4-2101. The intent of the HC-O Overlay District is to establish development
regulations which will promote the conservation, preservation and restoration of
landmarks, historic properties and other structures, areas and neighborhoods.

SECTION 7-1 INTENT
7-101. The CS Countryside District is intended to reduce the number of
nonconforming properties, both undeveloped and developed, which would
otherwise result from the application of these regulations to newly-annexed
property and to properties in unincorporated Cowley County which are within the
City's zoning jurisdiction. The CS district will provide a rural residential lifestyle
where residents have adequate open space by which to preserve that character.
This district is particularly suited for cluster subdivisions developed in accordance
with the Citys subdivision regulations.
The district is also intended to allow for limited future single-family residential
development without encouraging the premature loss of open space or the loss
of land used for agricultural purposes.
7-102. Following the effective date of these Regulations, to be eligible for zoning
classification as Countryside, land should be considered on a section (640 acres)
basis. Only sections of land which: (1) were comprised of 16 or more tracts,
parcels or lots, and each conforming to the relevant zoning regulations and
subdivision regulations in effect prior to the effective date of these Regulations
and (2) have a minimum of three miles of public roads through or abutting the
section, should be zoned Countryside. Land which does not itself meet the
above criteria, but which is surrounded by sections of land zoned Countryside,
may also be zoned Countryside.
7-103. New lots shall be created within the Countryside District only if
constituting 10 or more acres, as provided in Section 7-5.
SECTION 7-2 PERMITTED USES
7-201. In the Countryside District no building, structure, land or premises shall be
used and no building or structure shall be hereafter erected, constructed,
reconstructed, moved or altered, except for the following uses:

7-401. Sign regulations for the CS district are set out in Article 27.
SECTION 7-5 HEIGHT, AREA AND YARD
7-501. Height: Buildings or structures other than those actually used for
agricultural purposes shall not exceed 35 feet and/or two and one-half (2 1/2)
stories in height.
7-502. In the Countryside District, the minimum dimensions of lots and yards
shall be as follows:
a. Lot Area: For every lot created after May 20, 2014, the minimum lot area
shall be 10 acres with 600 feet or more of frontage on a public road. In
cases where unusual lot configuration or dedications for public uses have
created a lot of less than 10 acres, the Zoning Administrator shall
determine whether the lot area nonetheless meets the spirit and intent of
this requirement.
b. Lot Dimensions: For every lot created after May 20, 2014, the minimum
width of a lot shall be 600 feet. The minimum depth of a lot shall be 600
feet. There shall not be a lot depth-to-width ratio greater than 4:1 (i.e. the
depth of a lot cannot be greater than 4 times its width). In the event of
unusual lot configurations, the Zoning Administrator shall determine
whether the lot dimensions nonetheless meet the spirit and intent of this
requirement.

SECTION 16-1 INTENT
16-101. It is the intent of the Planned Unit Development Overlay (PUD-O)
District to encourage innovation in residential, commercial and industrial
development by greater variety in type, design and layout of buildings, to
encourage a more efficient use of land reflecting changes in the technology of
land development; to encourage the expansion of urban areas incorporating the
best features of modern design while conserving the value of the land; and to
provide a procedure which relates the type, design and layout of development to
the particular site and the particular demand at the time of development in a
manner consistent with the preservation of property values within established
neighborhoods.
The PUD-O District is an overlay zone. The developer shall submit preliminary
and final development plans in accordance with the provisions and conditions set
out in this Article.
SECTION 16-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS
16-201. A planned unit development shall be in general conformity with the

height. Generally consistent with the existing zoning district on the proposed
site, but may be varied for a specific site as proposed by the developer when so
approved.
d. Parking. Off-street parking and loading areas shall be provided for all uses
within the district in accordance with the requirements of these regulations,
unless it is determined by the Planning Commission and the Governing Body that
other parking ratios are more appropriate for a specific proposal.
SECTION 16-3 SPECIFIC STANDARDS AND CONDITIONS
16-301.
a. The applicant shall satisfy the Planning Commission that he or she has the ability
to carry out the proposed plan and shall prepare and submit a schedule of
construction. The proposed construction shall begin within a period of eighteen
(18) months following approval of a final plan by the Governing Body. The time
period established for the commencing of the plan may be modified from time to
time by the Planning Commission upon the showing of good cause by the
developer. In the event the landowner shall fail to commence the planned unit
development within eighteen (18) months after final approval has been granted
by the Governing Body, such approval shall terminate and shall be deemed null
and void unless such time period is extended by the Planning Commission upon
written application by the landowners.
b. The site shall be accessible from public roads that are adequate to carry the
traffic that will be generated by the proposed development. The streets and
driveways on the site of the development shall be adequate to serve the
residents or occupants of the proposed development. Streets may be either
public or private streets, however all private streets shall be of a size that will
carry anticipated traffic and shall be paved. If it is determined that traffic control
signals are required to prevent traffic hazards or congestion upon adjacent
streets, the control signals shall be provided at the developer's expense.
c. The development shall not impose an undue burden on public services and
facilities.

facilities shall be compatible with the surrounding land uses, and any part of a
planned unit development not used for structures, parking, loading areas, or
access ways shall be landscaped or otherwise improved.
f. When a commercial or industrial planned unit development or a commercial or
industrial use within a mixed use development abuts a residential district, either
adjacent to or within the planned development, a solid or semi-solid fence or wall
from six (6) to eight (8) feet in height and having a visual density of not less than
ninety percent (90%) per square foot shall be erected. Such fence or wall shall
be on or within three (3) feet of the property line separating the use from the
residential zone. Screen plantings may be used provided the type, size and
number are shown on the final development plan and are approved by the
Planning Commission. All required screening and plantings shall be maintained.
g. Setbacks shall be as required in the base zone in which the planned unit
development is located unless otherwise specifically approved by the Planning
Commission and Governing Body.
h. The planned unit development shall include such provisions for the ownership
and maintenance of the common open spaces and private streets as are
reasonably necessary to insure its continuity, care, conservation and
maintenance, and to insure that remedial measures will be available to the
Governing Body if such is allowed to deteriorate, or is not maintained in a
condition consistent with the best interest of the planned development or of the
entire community.
i. No residential use shall have vehicular access onto an arterial street.
j. Sidewalks shall be provided for on all private streets in accordance with the size,
construction and location or sidewalks on public streets. An alternative
pedestrian and sidewalk plan may be developed which provides pedestrians

shall be given to providing for bicycle traffic along arterial and collector streets
and along the approved pedestrian sidewalk system.
SECTION 16-4 APPLICATION PROCESS
16-401. The process for PUD-O approval is a two-step process. The applicant shall
submit application for preliminary approval to the Planning Commission which shall
conduct a public hearing on the application. The recommendation of the Planning
Commission shall be submitted to the Governing Body for approval. The developer
may then submit a final plan on the entire project or for designated areas to the
16-4
Planning Commission for approval. The recommendation of the Planning Commission
on the final plat is then submitted to the Governing Body for its final approval and/or
acceptance of street rights-of-way and utility easements.

NONCONFORMITIES
Sections:
21-1 General Provisions

21-3 Nonconforming Structures
21-4 Nonconforming Uses
21-5 Nonconforming Manufactured Homes
SECTION 21-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
21-101. Nonconformities are of three types: nonconforming lots of record,
nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses. Regulations governing
nonconforming manufactured homes are set forth at Section 21-5. Types of
nonconformities are defined as follows:
a. Nonconforming lots of record: Means an unimproved lot which is part
of a recorded subdivision or a parcel of land, the deed to which was
recorded with the Cowley County Register of Deeds prior to the Citys
adoption of these Regulations and neither said lot nor parcel complies with
the lot width and/or area requirements for the district in which it is located.
b. Nonconforming structure: Means an existing structure which does not
comply with the lot coverage, height or yard requirements which are
applicable to new structures in the zoning district in which the structure is
located.
c. Nonconforming use: Means an existing, lawful use of a structure or land
which does not comply with the use regulations applicable to new uses in
the zoning district in which it is located.
SECTION 21-2 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD
21-201. The Zoning Administrator, upon request of the property owner, shall
issue a zoning certificate for any nonconforming lot of record, provided that:
a. The lot is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned
separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the
21-2
creation of a lot of such size and width at such location would not have
been prohibited by any zoning regulations, and
b. The lot has remained in separate and individual ownership from adjoining
tracts of land continuously during the entire time that the creation of such
lot has been prohibited by the applicable zoning regulations.
SECTION 21-3 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
21-301.
a. Authority to continue. Any structure that is devoted to a use which is
permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, but which is located
on a lot which does not comply with the applicable intensity of use
regulations and/or the applicable yard and height regulations, may be
continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful.
b. Enlargement, repair, alterations. Any nonconforming structure may be
enlarged, maintained, repaired or remodeled. No such enlargement,
maintenance, repair or remodeling shall either create any additional
nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity of all or
any part of such structure. An enlargement which does not, in the Zoning
Administrators determination, extend the nonconformity beyond the
existing nonconformity shall not be an additional nonconformity or an
increase in the degree of nonconformity.
c. Damage or destruction. In the event that any nonconforming structure is
damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than fifty (50)
percent of its fair market value, such structure shall not be restored unless
it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which
it is located.
d. Moving. No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part
for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same lot or any
other lot unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being moved.
SECTION 21-4 NONCONFORMING USES
21-401.
a. Authority to continue. Any nonconforming use of part or all of a
structure or any nonconforming use of land which was lawful and in
existence at the effective date of these regulations may be continued, so
21-3
long as otherwise lawful and so long as it is not specified to be terminated
by these regulations.
b. Ordinary repair and maintenance.
1. Normal maintenance and incidental repair, or replacement,
installation or relocation of walls, partitions, fixtures, wiring or
plumbing, may be performed on any structure that is devoted in
whole or in part to a nonconforming use.
2. Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of a structure in
accordance with an order of a public official who is charged with
protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to be
unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition.
c. Extension. A nonconforming use shall not be extended, expanded,
enlarged, or increased in intensity. Such prohibited activities shall include,
without being limited to the following:
1. Extension of such use to any structure or land area other than that
actually physically occupied by such nonconforming use on the
effective date of these regulations or on the effective date of
subsequent amendments to these regulations that cause such use
to become nonconforming.
2. Extension of such use within a building or other structure to any
portion of the floor area that was not actually physically occupied by
such nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations
or on the effective date of subsequent amendments to these
regulations that cause such use to become nonconforming;
provided, however, that such use may be extended throughout any
part of such building or other structure that is found by the Zoning
Administrator to have been lawfully and manifestly designed or
constructed for such use on such effective date.
d. Enlargement. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner unless
such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
e. Damage or destruction. In the event that any structure that is devoted in
whole or in part to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any
means, to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its fair market value,
such structure shall not be restored unless such structure and the use
21-4
thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in
which it is located.
f. Moving. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use and no nonconforming use of land shall be moved in
whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the
same or any other lot, unless the entire structure and the use thereof or
the use of land shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located after being so moved.
g. Change in use. Any change in use from nonconforming use to a different
nonconforming use is prohibited if the Zoning Administrator determines
that such a change would increase the degree of nonconformity with the
applicable zoning regulations.
h. Abandonment or discontinuance. When a nonconforming use is
discontinued or abandoned for a period of twelve (12) consecutive
months, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and
any subsequent use or occupancy of such land or buildings shall comply
with the regulations of the zoning district in which such land is located.
i. Nonconforming accessory uses. No nonconforming use which is
accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue after the
abandonment or discontinuance of the principal nonconforming use.
SECTION 21-5 NONCONFORMING MANUFACTURED HOMES
21-501. The removal and relocation of nonresidential-design manufactured
homes in only the R-1, R-2, R-3 and CS Districts shall be governed by the
following regulations:
a. Upon removal of a nonconforming manufactured home, unless another
manufactured home, manufactured no more than fifteen (15) years
previously, is moved onto the same lot within thirty (30) days from the date
that the previous manufactured home was moved off the lot, such use is
forfeited and shall not thereafter be reestablished.
b. Any manufactured home moved in accordance with a. above shall be
placed on a permanent, enclosed perimeter foundation within thirty (30)
days from the date it is moved onto the lot.
c. No manufactured home moved in accordance with a. above shall be
moved onto a lot which is nonconforming either with the lot width or area
requirements for the district in which it is located.
21-5
d. No manufactured home moved in accordance with a. above shall be
moved onto a lot if such will result in an increase in nonconformity with
respect to lot size, yard or bulk requirements.
e. No manufactured home moved in accordance with a. above shall be
moved onto a lot if its location shall place it within twenty feet (20') of a
principal building or ten feet (10') of an accessory building.
f. Upon proper application the Board of Zoning Appeals may grant an
exception to the time requirements of subsections a. and b. above upon a
finding by the Board of hardship for the party who would reside in the
manufactured home upon its relocation.

SECTION 22-1 PURPOSE
22-101. These regulations require off-street parking proportional to the need
created by each use in order to ensure functionally adequate, aesthetically
pleasing, and secure off-street parking facilities. Regulations and standards are
intended to ensure usefulness of parking and loading facilities, to protect public
safety, and where appropriate, to limit potential adverse impacts on adjacent
property.
SECTION 22-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS
22-201. Applicability. Off-street parking facilities, as required in this Article,
shall be provided for any new building and for any new use established, additions
to existing use, or any change in manner of use which results in increased
capacity. Additional parking need only be provided for the addition, enlargement,
or change and not the entire building or use. No off-street parking facilities shall
be required in the C-4 Central Business District.
22-202. Maintenance. All existing and required parking facilities shall be
maintained and shall not be reduced so long as the use requiring such parking
remains.
22-203. Utilization. Required off-street parking facilities shall be located on the
same site as the use for which such facilities are required, except as authorized
by Section 22-6. Such facilities shall be used exclusively for temporary parking
of motor vehicles and shall not be utilized for sale or storage of merchandise, or
for storage or repair of vehicles, equipment or trailers.
22- 2
22-204. Residential districts. Parking facilities which make provisions for more
than three (3) vehicles shall not be located within the required front yard for the
district.
22-205. Computation. Where the determination of number of off-street parking
spaces required results in a fractional part of a space, a fraction of one-half or
more shall be counted as a full space and a fraction of less than one-half shall be
disregarded. Where requirements are established on the basis of seats or
person capacity, the provisions of the City-adopted building code applicable at
the time shall be used to calculate maximum design capacity.
22-206. Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to
approve minor variations from the location, size and number of parking spaces
otherwise required under this Article when, in his or her discretion, such variation
does not violate the purpose of these regulations and does not harm public
health, safety or welfare. The Zoning Administrator is specifically authorized to
allow some required parking spaces on commercial properties to be used, for a
fixed number of days, for temporary sales purposes, including but not limited to
lawn and garden and other seasonal materials.
SECTION 22-3 LAYOUT AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
22-301. Area size. Each required parking space shall consist of a rectangular
area of not less than nine (9) feet in width, by nineteen (19) feet in length. All
required spaces shall be clearly marked and defined except for spaces for singlefamily
and two-family dwellings, where parking spaces may be those portions of
a driveway that are not within the city right-of-way.
22-302. Access. Except in R-1 and R-2 districts, each required off-street
parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway of such width and
design as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to such parking
space. Streets and alleys shall be used only for access to and from parking
facilities and shall not be used for maneuvering of vehicles. Any alley used for
access to other than a single-family residence shall be paved according to Cityadopted
specifications.
22-303. Design standards. Minimum parking facility design standards shall
comply with City-adopted specifications and the most current version of the U.S.
Department of Justice ADA Standards for Accessible Design.
22-304. Driveways. Driveway location and spacing shall comply with the
Corridor Management Policy Manual of the Kansas Department of
Transportation. Site plans for commercial properties shall include a traffic impact
analysis and an internal traffic circulation plan making full use of shared
entrances.

22-305. Surfacing. All off-street parking facilities, loading areas, vehicular
storage areas and drives and access to and from such areas shall be surfaced
and maintained with four (4) inches of asphalt, or concrete to create a permanent
all-weather, dust-free surface. Such paving must be completed prior to
occupancy of the facility that the paving is intended to serve, unless temporary
occupancy approval is received from the Zoning Administrator. An exception to
the surfacing requirements may be granted by the Zoning Administrator in
instances where the off-street areas take access from a graveled public street.
Gravel areas in existence prior to the effective date of these regulations may be
maintained with six (6) inches of gravel, including base, as an alternative to these
surfacing requirements.
The Zoning Administrator may, upon receiving a specific written request from an
owner of a property, authorize temporary occupancy for a time period not to
exceed twelve (12) months prior to accomplishing the required paving or a
portion thereof.
In reviewing a request for temporary occupancy prior to accomplishing required
paving, the Zoning Administrator shall consider the following criteria:
a. Season of the year.
b. Affect on the adjoining property.
c. Surfacing of the connecting street.
d. Surfacing of existing adjoining parking facilities.
Should the owner receive approval of the Zoning Administrator for a delay in
paving, the owner shall, prior to occupancy, present written verification to the
Zoning Administrator that guarantees all paving shall be complete prior to the
deadline given by the Zoning Administrator.
22-306. Lighting. Any lighting provided to illuminate any parking facility shall be
designed and installed in such a manner as to reflect away from any residential
use upon adjoining properties.
22-307. Drainage. All parking facilities shall be graded and/or designed with
storm drainage facilities so as to channel surface water away from adjoining
properties and to an approved storm drainage system.
22-308. Parking facilities in residential districts. Any parking facilities for
eight (8) or more vehicles (1) when in residential zoning districts and (2) which
are adjacent to a residential or manufactured home-zoned district, shall have a
22- 4
screened fence or wall to prevent the passage of vehicular lights and to prevent
the blowing of debris. Such fence or wall shall be at least six (6) feet in height
and have a visual density of not less than seventy percent (70%).

Section:
22-1 Purpose
22-2 General Provisions

22-5 Required Parking Spaces
22-6 Exceptions Granted by Board of Zoning Appeals
22-7 Loading and Unloading Space Requirements
22-8 Districts Requiring Loading and Unloading Space
SECTION 22-1 PURPOSE
22-101. These regulations require off-street parking proportional to the need
created by each use in order to ensure functionally adequate, aesthetically
pleasing, and secure off-street parking facilities. Regulations and standards are
intended to ensure usefulness of parking and loading facilities, to protect public
safety, and where appropriate, to limit potential adverse impacts on adjacent
property.
SECTION 22-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS
22-201. Applicability. Off-street parking facilities, as required in this Article,
shall be provided for any new building and for any new use established, additions
to existing use, or any change in manner of use which results in increased
capacity. Additional parking need only be provided for the addition, enlargement,
or change and not the entire building or use. No off-street parking facilities shall
be required in the C-4 Central Business District.
22-202. Maintenance. All existing and required parking facilities shall be
maintained and shall not be reduced so long as the use requiring such parking
remains.
22-203. Utilization. Required off-street parking facilities shall be located on the
same site as the use for which such facilities are required, except as authorized
by Section 22-6. Such facilities shall be used exclusively for temporary parking
of motor vehicles and shall not be utilized for sale or storage of merchandise, or
for storage or repair of vehicles, equipment or trailers.
22- 2
22-204. Residential districts. Parking facilities which make provisions for more
than three (3) vehicles shall not be located within the required front yard for the
district.
22-205. Computation. Where the determination of number of off-street parking
spaces required results in a fractional part of a space, a fraction of one-half or
more shall be counted as a full space and a fraction of less than one-half shall be
disregarded. Where requirements are established on the basis of seats or
person capacity, the provisions of the City-adopted building code applicable at
the time shall be used to calculate maximum design capacity.
22-206. Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to
approve minor variations from the location, size and number of parking spaces
otherwise required under this Article when, in his or her discretion, such variation
does not violate the purpose of these regulations and does not harm public
health, safety or welfare. The Zoning Administrator is specifically authorized to
allow some required parking spaces on commercial properties to be used, for a
fixed number of days, for temporary sales purposes, including but not limited to
lawn and garden and other seasonal materials.
SECTION 22-3 LAYOUT AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
22-301. Area size. Each required parking space shall consist of a rectangular
area of not less than nine (9) feet in width, by nineteen (19) feet in length. All
required spaces shall be clearly marked and defined except for spaces for singlefamily
and two-family dwellings, where parking spaces may be those portions of
a driveway that are not within the city right-of-way.
22-302. Access. Except in R-1 and R-2 districts, each required off-street
parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway of such width and
design as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to such parking
space. Streets and alleys shall be used only for access to and from parking
facilities and shall not be used for maneuvering of vehicles. Any alley used for
access to other than a single-family residence shall be paved according to Cityadopted
specifications.
22-303. Design standards. Minimum parking facility design standards shall
comply with City-adopted specifications and the most current version of the U.S.
Department of Justice ADA Standards for Accessible Design.
22-304. Driveways. Driveway location and spacing shall comply with the
Corridor Management Policy Manual of the Kansas Department of
Transportation. Site plans for commercial properties shall include a traffic impact
analysis and an internal traffic circulation plan making full use of shared
entrances.
22- 3
22-305. Surfacing. All off-street parking facilities, loading areas, vehicular
storage areas and drives and access to and from such areas shall be surfaced
and maintained with four (4) inches of asphalt, or concrete to create a permanent
all-weather, dust-free surface. Such paving must be completed prior to
occupancy of the facility that the paving is intended to serve, unless temporary
occupancy approval is received from the Zoning Administrator. An exception to
the surfacing requirements may be granted by the Zoning Administrator in
instances where the off-street areas take access from a graveled public street.
Gravel areas in existence prior to the effective date of these regulations may be
maintained with six (6) inches of gravel, including base, as an alternative to these
surfacing requirements.
The Zoning Administrator may, upon receiving a specific written request from an
owner of a property, authorize temporary occupancy for a time period not to
exceed twelve (12) months prior to accomplishing the required paving or a
portion thereof.
In reviewing a request for temporary occupancy prior to accomplishing required
paving, the Zoning Administrator shall consider the following criteria:
a. Season of the year.
b. Affect on the adjoining property.
c. Surfacing of the connecting street.
d. Surfacing of existing adjoining parking facilities.
Should the owner receive approval of the Zoning Administrator for a delay in
paving, the owner shall, prior to occupancy, present written verification to the
Zoning Administrator that guarantees all paving shall be complete prior to the
deadline given by the Zoning Administrator.
22-306. Lighting. Any lighting provided to illuminate any parking facility shall be
designed and installed in such a manner as to reflect away from any residential
use upon adjoining properties.
22-307. Drainage. All parking facilities shall be graded and/or designed with
storm drainage facilities so as to channel surface water away from adjoining
properties and to an approved storm drainage system.
22-308. Parking facilities in residential districts. Any parking facilities for
eight (8) or more vehicles (1) when in residential zoning districts and (2) which
are adjacent to a residential or manufactured home-zoned district, shall have a
22- 4
screened fence or wall to prevent the passage of vehicular lights and to prevent
the blowing of debris. Such fence or wall shall be at least six (6) feet in height
and have a visual density of not less than seventy percent (70%).
SECTION 22-4 PERMIT REQUIRED
22-401. Plans showing the layout, landscaping and design of all off-street
parking, loading, or other vehicular use areas shall be submitted to, and
approved by the Zoning Administrator prior to beginning construction. A permit

SECTION 23-7 RESERVED
SECTION 23-8 CONSIDERATION OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT
23-801.
a. Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, a Conditional Use Permit
application for a telecommunications tower shall be subject to the same
procedures for consideration and action as applies to any other
Conditional Use Permit application pursuant to Article 26 of these
regulations.
b. In lieu of the factors for consideration of a Conditional Use Permit
application under Article 26 of these regulations, the Planning Commission
may recommend approval of a Conditional Use Permit, and the Governing
Body may approve such permit for a telecommunications tower, using the
following factors as guidelines:
1. Whether approval of the conditional use would be consistent with
the intent and purpose of, and meets the requirements of, these
regulations;
23-4
2. The aesthetic impact of the proposed telecommunications tower on
the surrounding neighborhood;
3. Whether the positions of the applicant and/or the opponents are
substantiated by substantial competent evidence, or rather
generalized concerns or unsubstantiated claims are made to the
Planning Commission and/or Governing Body;
4. Whether a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license
has been granted to the applicant authorizing provision of wireless
services to the community and whether radio frequency emissions
will comply with FCC regulations;
5. Whether the tower will adversely impact adjoining property values,
present a hazard to air space, traffic, or in any other manner create
negative impacts upon the neighborhood or community;
6. The recommendation of professional planning staff;
7. The expert testimony presented on behalf of and in opposition to
the application; and
8. Such other factors as may be relevant to the facts and evidence
presented in the application.
c. Consideration of an application for a Conditional Use Permit for a
telecommunications tower shall be considered and acted upon by the
Planning Commission and Governing Body in adherence to the limitations
upon local authorities set out in Kan. Stat. Ann. 66-2019, the National
Wireless Telecommunications Siting Policy, Section 332(c), 47 U.S.C.
332(c) and any other applicable law. Federal law provides in part that the
regulation of the placement, construction and modification of personal
wireless service facilities by a local government shall not unreasonably
discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services; and shall
not prohibit nor have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal
wireless services. Further, the siting policy provides that a local
government shall act on any request for authorization to place, construct
or modify personal wireless service facilities within a reasonable period of
time after the request is duly filed, taking into account the nature and

recommendation of disapproval. Any hearing may, for good cause at the request
of the applicant, or in the discretion of the Planning Commission, be continued.
26-104. Action by Planning Commission and Governing Body.
a. Recommendations. Upon the conclusion of the public hearing, the
Planning Commission shall prepare and adopt its recommendations and
shall submit the same, together with a record of the hearing thereon, to
the Governing Body. The recommendation may be for approval,
disapproval or approval in part and reasons for the recommendations shall
be included. If a motion for approval fails to gain approval for any reason,
the application is deemed to have been denied and will be submitted to
the Governing Body. If the recommendation is for approval, the
recommendation made to the Governing Body shall be in the form of an
ordinance.
b. Amendments to text. When a proposed amendment would result in a
change in the text of these regulations, but would not result in a change of
zoning classification of any specific property, the recommendation of the
Planning Commission shall contain a statement as to the nature and effect
of such proposed amendment and its reasons for recommending approval
or denial.
c. Adoption of amendments. The Governing Body shall not consider an
amendment which would result in a change of zoning classification for a
specific property, or any application for a Conditional Use Permit, until its
next regular meeting after the lapse of the fourteen (14) day protest period
provided by state law. A proposed amendment which changes the text of
the regulations but would not result in change of zoning classification of
any specific property may be considered by the Governing Body without
waiting for the lapse of the fourteen (14) day protest period. Upon receipt
of the recommendation of the Planning Commission and any protest
26-4
petitions that have been submitted, the Governing Body shall consider the
application and may 1) approve the recommendation of the Planning
Commission without change; 2) override the Planning Commission's
recommendation by a 2/3 majority vote of the membership of the
Governing Body; or 3) return such recommendation to the Planning
Commission with a statement specifying the basis for the Governing
Bodys failure to approve or disapprove. Upon return of a
recommendation from the Planning Commission, the Governing Body may
take whatever action it deems necessary. Whenever a proposed
amendment is defeated by vote of the Governing Body, such amendment
shall not thereafter be passed without a further public hearing and notice
thereof as provided in this article.
d. If such amendment or Conditional Use Permit affects the boundaries of
any zone or district, the ordinance shall describe the boundaries as
amended, or if provision is made for the fixing of the same upon the official
maps which have been incorporated by reference, the amending
ordinance shall define the change or the boundary as amended, shall
order the official maps be changed to reflect such amendment or
conditional use, shall amend the section of the ordinance incorporating the
same and shall reincorporate such maps as amended.
e. In its consideration of an amendment to a zoning classification or a
Conditional Use Permit the Governing Body shall rely upon the record as
prepared by the Planning Commission, such record to be supplemented
only by information provided by City staff. Additional new information for
Governing Body consideration shall be allowed only upon findings by the
Governing Body that (1) good cause exists as to why the evidence or
testimony sought to be presented to the Governing Body was not
presented to the Planning Commission and (2) it is in the best interests of
both the applicant and the public that the evidence or testimony be
presented to the Governing Body rather than having the matter sent back
to the Planning Commission for its consideration of the evidence or
testimony.
26-105. Protest Petition. Regardless of whether or not the Planning
Commission recommends approval or disapproval of a proposed zoning
amendment, revision, change, or Conditional Use Permit, if a protest petition
against such amendment is filed in the office of the City Clerk within fourteen (14)
days after the date of the conclusion of the public hearing pursuant to the
publication notice, signed by the owners of twenty (20) percent or more of any
real property proposed to be rezoned or by the owners of record of twenty (20)
percent or more of the total area, excepting public streets and ways, which is
located within the notification area described in Section 26-102, the ordinance
adopting such amendment shall not be passed except by at least a 3/4 majority
vote of all the members of the Governing Body.
26-5
26-106. Limitations on Successive Applications. Provisions for a limitation
on successive applications to the Planning Commission shall be as follows:
a. No application for an amendment to these regulations including the zoning
map shall be accepted by the Planning Commission if an application for
the same amendment has been denied by the Planning Commission
within the preceding twelve (12) months. The withdrawal of an application
after it has been advertised for public hearing shall constitute a denial of
the application just as if the public hearing had been held and concluded.
For good cause shown by the applicant the Governing Body may waive
the twelve (12) month requirement.
b. Irrespective of the preceding subsection, an application for a rehearing
may be accepted by the Planning Commission if in the judgment of the
Planning Commission substantial justification is given. All such
applications for a rehearing must be submitted to the secretary at least
fifteen (15) days in advance of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
Planning Commission following the denial of the application. If the
Planning Commission at such meeting determines that there has been
substantial change or justification for a rehearing, the item will be
advertised and a public hearing held at the next regular scheduled
meeting of the Planning Commission.
26-107. Posting of Sign. An applicant for a rezoning or for a Conditional Use
Permit may be required by the Zoning Administrator to place a sign upon the lot,
tract or parcel of land for which the application was filed. Said sign shall be
furnished by the Zoning Administrator to the applicant and the applicant shall
display the sign as instructed by the Zoning Administrator. Failure to comply with
this requirement shall not deprive the Planning Commission of its jurisdiction or
affect any decision, but may be due cause for the Planning Commission to refuse
to hear the application or to adjourn the hearing or to require further notice.
26-108. Factors to be Considered in a Rezoning. When a proposed
amendment would result in a change of the zoning classification of any specific
property, the recommendation of the Planning Commission, accompanied by a
copy of the record of the hearing, shall contain statements as to the present
classification, the classification under the proposed amendment, the reasons for
seeking such reclassification, a summary of the facts presented, and a statement
of the factors upon which the recommendation of the Planning Commission is
based, using the following guidelines:
a. Whether the change in classification would be consistent with the intent
and purpose of these regulations.
b. The character and condition of the surrounding neighborhood and its
26-6
effect on the proposed change: This entails a description of the
neighborhood as to existing land uses, intensity of development, age and
general condition of structures.
c. Whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of
changed or changing conditions in the area affected, and, if so, the nature
of such changed or changing conditions.
d. The current zoning and uses of nearby properties, and the effect on
existing nearby land uses upon such a change in classification: The
zoning surrounding the property at issue, along with the actual uses on
those properties, is to be considered.
e. Whether every use that would be permitted on the property as reclassified
would be compatible with the uses permitted on other property in the
immediate vicinity: Consideration is to be given as to whether each of the
permitted uses under the proposed rezoning would be compatible with
existing uses. The focus is upon issues which can be addressed via
zoning, such as structure height, yards and setbacks, and minimum lot
sizes.
f. The suitability of the applicants property for the uses to which it has been
restricted: How the property at issue is presently zoned, and the uses
permitted under that zoning is to be considered, as well as whether those
uses are appropriate given the zoning of the surrounding neighborhood.
Also to be considered is whether the presently allowed uses are the only
uses appropriate for the subject property.
g. The length of time the subject property has remained vacant or
undeveloped as zoned: Consideration is to be given as to whether the
subject property is vacant because its present zoning is unsuitable, or
whether it is vacant for reasons unrelated to zoning, e.g., a surplus of
similarly-zoned property, problems with financing, lack of infrastructure or
other development problems.
h. Whether adequate sewer and water facilities, and all other needed public
services exist or can be provided to serve the uses that would be
permitted on the property if it were reclassified.
i. The general amount of vacant land that currently has the same zoning
classification proposed for the subject property, particularly in the vicinity
of the subject property, and any special circumstances that make a
substantial part of such vacant land available or not available for
development.
j. The recommendations of professional staff and advisors: Staff
26-7
recommendations should be based upon the factors set out in this section,
the adopted comprehensive plan, other adopted plans and reports, and
the evidence in the record.
k. Whether the proposed amendment would be in conformance to and
further enhance the implementation of the City's Comprehensive Plan:
The question here is whether the requested rezoning is consistent with the
recommendations of the adopted comprehensive plan. If it is not, is the
incompatibility because the plan is outdated or have conditions changed in
the area or neighborhood of the subject property?
l. Whether the relative gain to the public health, safety, and general welfare
outweighs the hardship imposed upon the applicant by not upgrading the
value of the property by such reclassification: This factor acknowledges
that the basis for zoning is protection of public health, safety and welfare.
Any rezoning request involves balancing the property owner's interests
with the interests of the public.
m. Such other factors as the Planning Commission may deem relevant from
the facts and evidence presented in the application.
26-109. Applications for Conditional Use Permit. Because of particular
conditions associated with their activities, certain uses which might have an
adverse effect upon nearby properties or upon the character and future
development of a district are not permitted outright in districts, but are allowed as
conditional uses when their proposed location is supplemented by additional
requirements so as to make the use requested compatible with the surrounding
property, the neighborhood and the zoning jurisdiction.
26-110. Factors to be Considered in Permit Applications. The Planning
Commission may recommend approval of a conditional use that is expressly
authorized to be permitted in a particular zoning district, and the Governing Body
may approve such conditional use, using the following factors as guidelines
following the same explanation of those factors as set out n Section 26-108 for
rezonings:
a. Whether approval of the conditional use would be consistent with the
intent and purpose of these regulations;
b. Whether the location of the proposed use is compatible to other land uses
in the surrounding neighborhood;
c. Whether the proposed use places an undue burden on the existing public
infrastructure in the area affected and, if so, whether additional
infrastructure can be provided;
26-8
d. Whether the proposed use is made necessary or desirable because of
changed or changing conditions in the area affected;
e. The length of time the subject property has remained vacant or
undeveloped as zoned;
f. Whether the applicants property is suitable for the proposed conditional
use;
g. The recommendations of professional staff and advisors;
h. Whether the proposed conditional use would be in conformance to and
further enhance the implementation of the City's Comprehensive Plan;
i. Whether the proposed conditional use, if it complies with all the conditions
upon which the approval is made contingent, will not adversely affect the
property in the area affected;
j. For such uses as solid waste disposal facilities, including sanitary landfills,
construction and demolition landfills and transfer stations, whether the
proposed conditional use is consistent with any adopted Solid Waste
Management Plan of Cowley County, and amendments thereto; and
k. Such other factors as the Planning Commission may deem relevant from
the facts and evidence presented in the application.
SECTION 26-2 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
26-201. The application, notice, public hearing, and action procedures set forth
in this Article shall be applicable to all applications for Conditional Use Permits
submitted after the effective date of these regulations.
26-202. The Governing Body, when approving a Conditional Use Permit, shall
specify the period of time for which the permit is valid or shall state that the term
of the permit is not limited in time.
26-203. Upon approval of a Conditional Use Permit, the Zoning District Map
shall be changed in the manner outlined in this Article.
SECTION 26-3 TABLE OF LESSER CHANGE
26-301. The following Table of Lesser Change is for the use of the Planning
Commission in determining when an application for rezoning is or is not required.
This Table of Lesser Change designates which zoning classifications are lesser
26-9
changes authorized within the published zoning classifications. The Table of
Lesser Change lists zoning classifications in descending order from the most
restrictive zoning district to the least restrictive zoning district. The Planning
Commission may modify, at its discretion, an application for rezoning to a
particular district by recommending to the Governing Body a rezoning to a district
of lesser change, as determined by the following Table of Lesser Change:
R-1 Low Density Residential District
R-2 Medium Density Residential District
R-3 High Density Residential District

C-1 Office and Service Business District
C-2 Restricted Commercial District
C-3 General Commercial District
C-4 Central Business District

SECTION 26-4 FEES FOR REZONINGS AND CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
26-401. A fee, in the amount established by ordinance adopted by the
Governing Body, shall accompany an application for rezoning or Conditional Use
Permit.
26-402. No fee shall be required if the zoning change is initiated by the Planning
Commission or the Governing Body. No fee shall be required if either the
Planning Commission or Governing Body initiate an amendment to the zoning
regulations that will not affect specific property.

27-101. Statement of purpose: This article provides standards relating to signs
located within the city of Arkansas City, and governs the number, size, type,
location and physical aspects of signs. It is determined that the regulation of
Signs is necessary to promote safety, to preserve and enhance the aesthetic and
environmental values of the community, to provide for effective communication
between people within the context of their environment and to protect the rights
of free speech and expression.
27-102. Substitution of Messages: Subject to the land owners consent, a noncommercial
message of any type may be substituted for any duly permitted or
allowed commercial message or any duly permitted or allowed noncommercial
message, provided that the Sign is legal without consideration of message
content. This substitution of message may be made without any additional
approval or permitting. This provision does not create a right to increase the total
amount of signage on a parcel or land use, nor does it affect the requirement that
the structural device or mounting device be properly permitted.

3. The Electronic Message Centers programmed display must follow
the requirements for the zoning district in which it is placed. Full
animation and full video are prohibited except where allowed by
issuance of a conditional use permit. Full animation is defined by
movement, or the illusion of movement, that occurs in sequence of
several frames without a hold time between frames. Full video is
considered to be a live stream, or video clip displayed on the unit in
a continuous fashion without a hold in between frames. Dynamic
frame effect is an alternative that can be used instead of full
animation or full video.
4. Electronic message centers, if located in a residential district or
within two hundred (200) feet of a residentially zoned district, may
only be operated between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.
5. A certificate of compliance must be signed and on file with the
Zoning Administrator. Any electronic message center found to be
operating outside of the regulations will be deemed a zoning
violation and shall be remedied according the provisions of Article
30 of these regulations.

SECTION 27-16 SIGN VARIANCE
27-1601. Procedures for requesting a variance to the sign regulations can be
found in Article 25 of these regulations.
SECTION 27-17 DESIGN REVIEW:
27-1701. Administrative Design Review:
An optional design review process, one that is voluntarily entered into by
applicants, rather than a mandatory one. This option allows the applicant to
choose between designing a sign strictly according to numerical standards or
going through a design review process that allows for larger signs, more
flexibility, or both. For example, the numerical standard for a projecting sign
might consist of a maximum allowable area of x square feet. This would
probably produce a simple, rectangular sign, maximizing the copy area. Under an
optional design review process, the sign area could be increased by a certain
percentage or sq. footage. The sign could include a unique, eye-catching logo
that would add liveliness to the streetscape. Such a method rewards both
businesses and sign producers for creative efforts.  A Framework for On-
Premise Sign Regulations March 2009 Alan C. Weinstein, Inc. D.B. Hart, Inc.
To use this method, submit a site plan indicating all existing signage, as well as,
indicating placement of the proposed signage. A scaled drawing of proposed
signage must be submitted for administrative review. To ensure proposed
signage aesthetically compliments the surrounding structures architectural
elements and is appropriate in scale.
SECTION 27-18 APPENDIX
27-1801. Sign Types.
The following section uses some local signs as an example of sign types
permitted within the sign regulations and similar sign types using creative
elements that could possibly be used in design review. The use of these images
is for example purposes only and not intended to convey a preference for a sign
design or a business shown.

27-1802. Sign Area measurement:
a. For a wall sign which is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared
and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area and
dimensions shall include the entire portion within such background or
frame.
b. For a wall sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements on a
wall or similar surface of the building or structure, the area and dimensions
of the sign shall encompass a regular geometric shape (rectangle, circle,
trapezoid, triangle, etc.), or a combination of regular geometric shapes,
which form, or approximate, the perimeter of all elements in the display,
the frame, and any applied background that is not part of the architecture
of the building. When separate elements are organized to form a single
sign, but are separated by open space, the sign area and dimensions shall
be calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination of forms,
which comprises all of the display areas, including the space between
different elements. Minor appendages to a particular regular shape, as
determined by the Zoning Administrator, shall not be included in the total
area of a sign.
c. For a freestanding sign, the sign area shall include the frame, if any, but
shall not include:
1. A pole or other structural support unless such pole or structural
support is internally illuminated or otherwise so designed to
constitute a display device, or a part of a display device.
Amended 1-19-16

2. Architectural features that are either part of the building or part of a
freestanding structure, and not an integral part of the sign, and
which may consist of landscaping, building or structural forms
complementing the site in general.

FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE
FOR THE CITY OF ARKANSAS CITY, KANSAS
Adopted By Reference Into Arkansas City Municipal Code By Ordinance No. x010- 6,2 4as1 Adopted On
The f Day Of uSf, 2010 And Incorporated Into Municipal Code Section 18. 16.010
ARTICLE 1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSES
SECTION A. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
1. Approval ofDraft Ordinance by Kansas ChiefEngineer Prior to Adoption
The following floodplain management regulations, as written, were approved in draft form by the Chief
Engineer of the Division of Water Resources of the Kansas Department of Agriculture on
20/ o.
2. Kansas Statutory Authorization
The Legislature of the State of Kansas has in K.S.A. 12- 741 et seq, and specifically in K.S.A. 12- 766,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations
designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the City Commission of the City
of Arkansas City, Kansas ordains as follows:
SECTION B. FINDINGS OF FACT
co' 1. Flood Losses Resultingfrom Periodic Inundation
The special flood hazard areas of the City of Arkansas City, Kansas, are subject to inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
2. General Causes ofthe Flood Losses
These flood losses are caused by ( 1) the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain
causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and ( 2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses
vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood
damages.
3. Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards
The Flood Insurance Study ( FIS) that is the basis of this ordinance uses a standard engineering method
of analyzing flood hazards, which consist of a series of interrelated steps.

a. Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations, which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated,
and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this ordinance is representative of large
floods, which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams
subject to this ordinance. The base flood is the flood that is estimated to have a one percent
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance
Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials dated October 19, 2010
as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
b. Calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis
ofthe capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
c. Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more
than one( 1) foot at any point.
d. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that
would cause any increase in flood height.
e. Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still
subject to inundation by the base flood.
SECTION C. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those
losses described in Article 1, Section B( 1); to establish or maintain the community' s eligibility for participation
in the National Flood Insurance Program ( NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR)
59.22( a)( 3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3( d) and K.A.R. 5- 44-4 by applying the provisions of 
this ordinance to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause
undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
2. Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with
flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
3. Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to
the flood hazard.
ARTICLE 2 GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION A. LANDS TO WHICH ORDINANCE APPLIES
This ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Arkansas City, Kansas identified as
numbered and unnumbered A Zones, AE, AO, and AH Zones, on the Index Map dated October 19, 2010
of the Flood Insurance Rate Map ( FIRM) as amended October 19, 2010
and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this ordinance, no development shall be permitted
except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit, granted by the City Commission or its duly
designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the City Commission or the designated
representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the
inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in Article 4.
SECTION B. COMPLIANCE
FEMA R-VII& KDA-DWR 2-20-2003 Page 3 Model 60.3( d)
No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended,
converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable
regulations.

It is not intended by this ordinance to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall
prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
SECTION D. INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance shall be held to be minimum
requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or
repeal of any other powers granted by Kansas statutes.
SECTION E. WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. This ordinance does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This ordinance shall not create a liability on the
iiipart of the City of Arkansas City, Kansas, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that may
result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made there under.

zones, on the community's FIRM shall be required to be installed using methods and practices that
minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated
and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but
are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
2. Require manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within unnumbered or numbered
A zones, AE, and AH zones, on the community's FIRM on sites:
a. Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;
b. In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
c. In an expansion to and existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or
d. In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has
incurred substantial-damage as the result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such
that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated a minimum of one ( 1) foot above the
base flood elevation and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to
resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be
certified by a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer.
3. Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision within all unnumbered and numbered A zones, AE and AH
zones, on the community's FIRM, that are not subject to the provisions of Article 4, Section C( 2) of this
ordinance, be elevated so that either:
a. The lowest floor of the manufactured home is a minimum of one ( 1) foot above the base flood

licensed land surveyor or professional engineer.
SECTION D. AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING( AO and All zones)
Located within the areas of special flood hazard as described in Article 2, Section A are areas designated as AO
zones. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one ( 1) to three ( 3) feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate. The following provisions apply:
1. AO Zones
a. All new construction and substantial-improvements of residential structures, including
manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's
FIRM( at least two( 2) feet if no depth number is specified).
b. All new construction and substantial-improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential
structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number
specified in feet on the community FIRM( at least two ( 2) feet if no depth number is specified)
or together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to that
level so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
c. Adequate drainage paths shall be required around structures on slopes, in order to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
2. AHZones
a. The specific standards for all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation has been
provided shall be required as set forth in Article 4, Section B.
b. Adequate drainage paths shall be required around structures on slopes, in order to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
SECTION E. FLOODWAY
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article 2, Section A, are areas designated as
floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry
debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:
1. The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen
for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing
the water surface elevation of that flood more than one( 1) foot at any point.
2. The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway tiYairintPIESCIMECES

demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
3. If Article 4, Section E( 2), is satisfied, all new construction and substantial- improvements shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 4.
4. In unnumbered A zones, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal, State, or other sources as set forth in
Article 4, Section A(2).
SECTION F. RECREATIONAL VEHICLES
Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within all unnumbered and numbered A Zones, AE, AH, and
AO Zones on the community' s FIRM either:
1. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or
2. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use*; or
3. Meet the permitting, elevation, and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes of this ordinance.
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.

applicable, expected at the site; and,
11. Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and
repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems; streets; and
bridges.
SECTION E. CONDITIONS FOR APPROVING FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT VARIANCES
1. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial- improvements to be erected on
a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood elevation, providing items two ( 2) through six ( 6) below have been
fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one- half acre, the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases.
2. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, repair, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed
on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of
historic places upon determination, provide the proposed activity will not preclude the structure' s
continued historic designation and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
3. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any significant increase in flood
discharge would result.
co.
4. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

KS DEPTOFAMASNIII
5. Variances shall only be issued upon: ( a) showing of good and sufficient cause, ( b) determination that
failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and( c) determination
that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
6. A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that: (a) the
issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $ 25. 00 for $ 100.00 of insurance coverage and ( b)
such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall
be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this ordinance.

except as otherwise expressly stated.
ARTICLE 30-2 VIOLATIONS
30-201.
a. Compliance Required. All Buildings and land used and all Buildings and
structures erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or structurally
altered shall comply with all applicable provisions of these Regulations.
b. Types of Violations. Unless otherwise expressly stated by these Regulations or
State law, any violation of these Regulations, including but not limited to the
following, will be subject to the remedies and penalties provided for in this Article:
1. to use land or buildings in any way not consistent with the requirements of
these Regulations;
2. to engage in development activity in any way not consistent with the
requirements of these Regulations;
3. to engage in the use of a building or land, the use, or development
activity requiring one or more permits or approvals under these
Regulations without obtaining all such required permits or approvals;
4. to engage in the use of a building or land, the use, or development
activity requiring one or more permits under these Regulations in any way
30-2
inconsistent with any such permit or approval or any conditions imposed
thereon;
5. to violate the terms of any permit or approval granted under these
Regulations or any condition imposed on such permit or approval;
6. to obscure, obstruct or destroy any notice required to be posted or
otherwise given under these Regulations; or
7. to violate any lawful order issued by any person or entity under these
Regulations.
c. Any lawful use of property, which use is subject to these Regulations, which as a
result of the adoption of these Regulations is not a permitted use in the zoning district in
which the property is located, but which use is a conditional use in that district in
accordance with these Regulations, is deemed to be a conditional use effective upon
adoption of these Regulations without the necessity of the granting of a conditional use
permit.
SECTION 30-3 CONTINUING VIOLATIONS
30-301. Each day that a violation remains uncorrected after receiving notice of the
violation from the City constitutes a separate violation of these Regulations for purposes
of calculating cumulative penalties.
SECTION 30-4 LIABILITY
30-401. The owner, tenant or occupant of any land or structure, shall be presumed to
know of activity occurring on the premises and thus may be charged with a violation of
these Regulations for any violation found on any premises subject to these Regulations.
Where an architect, contractor, builder or other person appears to have participated
directly in a violation of these Regulations, the Zoning Administrator may also charge
such person with a violation of these Regulations. All persons found to be responsible
for the actions or inactions leading to a violation may be charged jointly and severally
with violations as a result of the same incident or circumstances.
SECTION 30-5 REMEDIES AND ENFORCEMENT POWERS
30-501. The Zoning Administrator may use any of the following remedies and
enforcement powers:
a. Withhold Permits & Approvals. Deny or withhold all permits, certificates or
other forms of authorization on any land, or structure or improvements thereon:
30-3
(1) upon which there is an uncorrected violation of a provision of these
Regulations or of a condition or qualification of a permit, certificate,
approval or other authorization previously granted by the City; and
(2) owned or being developed by a person who owns, developed or otherwise
caused an uncorrected violation of a provision of these Regulations or of a
condition or qualification of a permit, certificate, approval or other
authorization previously granted by the City.
b. Approval of Permits & Approvals with Conditions. Instead of withholding or
denying a permit or other authorization, the Zoning Administrator may grant such
authorization only if adequate assurances are in place to ensure correction of the
violation and provided that granting the permit or authorization will not
compromise the public health, safety or general welfare.
c. Revoke Permits & Approvals. Any permit or other form of authorization
required under these Regulations may be revoked by the Zoning Administrator or
by any City official with authority to issue such permit when that City official
determines: (1) that there is departure from the plans, specifications, or
conditions as required under terms of the permit, (2) that the development permit
was procured by false representation or was issued by mistake, or (3) that any of
the provisions of these Regulations are being violated.
(1) Where permits are mistakenly issued, an applicant will be entitled to
appeal the permit revocation to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(2) Written notice of revocation shall be served upon the owner, the owners
agent or contractor, or upon any person employed on the building or
structure for which such permit was issued, or shall be posted in a
prominent location, and thereafter construction shall stop.
d. Stop Work. Whenever a building or part thereof is being constructed,
reconstructed, altered or repaired in violation of these Regulations, the Zoning
Administrator may order the work to be immediately stopped.
(1) The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing
the work. The stop-work order shall state the specific work to be stopped,
the specific reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the
work may be resumed.
(2) Violation of a stop-work order is a violation of these Regulations.
e. Revoke Plans or Related Approvals. Where a violation of these Regulations
involves a failure to comply with approved plans, or conditions to which the
approval of such plans was made subject, the City may, upon notice to the
30-4
applicant and other known parties in interest (including any holders of building
permits affected), revoke the plan or other approval or condition its continuance
on strict compliance with these Regulations, the provision of financial security to
ensure that construction is completed in compliance with approved plans, or such
other conditions as the City may reasonably impose. Any required financial
security shall be in a form approved by the City.
f. Legal Relief. Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-761(b), the City may commence a civil
action or proceeding in District Court to stop any violation of these Regulations or
of a permit, certificate or other form of authorization granted hereunder, to
remove a violation, or to restore the premises in question to the condition in
which they existed prior to violation. The relief sought may include:
(1) an injunction or other equitable relief;
(2) an order in the nature of mandamus or abatement;
(3) a judgment or order enforcing any requirement of, or under, these
Regulations to pay a fee or reimburse or compensate the City, including
when the City is required or authorized to take specified action at the
expense of the landowner; or
(4) any other judgment or order available under Kansas law.
g. Criminal Penalties. Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-761(a), any person, firm, or
corporation who shall violate any of the provisions of these Regulations, or fail to
comply with any order or regulation thereunder, or who shall engage in
development activity in violation of any specifications or plans submitted and
approved thereunder, or any certificate or permit issued thereunder, shall, for
each and every violation and non-compliance respectively be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and upon conviction therefore shall be, for each offense:
(1) fined in a sum not less than $10 nor more than $500;
(2) imprisoned for not more than six months; or
(3) both fined and imprisoned.
h. Other Penalties and Remedies. The City may seek such other penalties and
remedies, and employ such other enforcement powers, as are provided by
Kansas law for violations of zoning, subdivision, sign, or related provisions.
30-5
SECTION 30-6 ENFORCEMENT BY OTHERS
30-601.
a. Citizens. Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-761(b), any person, the value or use of whose
property is or may be affected by a violation of these Regulations, is authorized
to maintain a suit or action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the
provisions of these Regulations and to abate nuisances maintained in violation
thereof.
b. State Officials. Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-761(c) and in the case of violations to the
floodplain management regulations of these Regulations, the Attorney General
and the Chief Engineer of the Division of Water Resources of the Kansas State
Board of Agriculture are authorized, in addition to other remedies, to institute
injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate actions or proceedings to prevent,
correct or abate the violation.
SECTION 30-7 CONTINUATION OF PREVIOUS ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS
30-701. Nothing in these Regulations prohibits the Citys continuation of previous
enforcement actions, undertaken by the City pursuant to previous and valid ordinances
and laws.
SECTION 30-8 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE
30-801. The remedies and enforcement powers established in these Regulations are
cumulative, and the City may exercise them in any order.

SECTION 1-1 TITLE
1-101. These regulations shall hereinafter be known and may be cited as the Subdivision
Regulations for the City of Arkansas City, Kansas and shall hereinafter be referred to as
"these regulations."
SECTION 1-2 PURPOSE
1-201.
a. Subdivision Regulations are the process through which raw land is converted into
buildable lots for residential, commercial and industrial uses. The physical
arrangement of these lots along with provisions for streets, alleys, utilities,
schools, parks and other community facilities will in a large part determine the
quality of life in the community and, therefore, is of public interest. These
regulations establish standards that insure that growth will reflect sound planning
and will not be detrimental to the community.
b. These regulations are designed, intended and adopted for the following purposes:
1. To protect and provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of
the City of Arkansas City.
1-2
2. To implement the Comprehensive Plan for the City of Arkansas City.
3. To provide for adequate light, air and privacy, to secure safety from fire,
flood and other danger, and to prevent overcrowding of the land.
4. To protect and conserve the value and desirability of land and
neighborhoods throughout the community.
5. To guide public and private policy and action in order to provide adequate
and efficient transportation, water, sewage, schools, parks, playgrounds,
recreation and other public requirements and facilities necessary to protect
and promote public health, safety and general welfare.
6. To establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for
subdivisions and re-subdivisions.
7. To insure proper legal descriptions, monumenting of land, and adequate
and accurate platting and records of land subdivision.
8. To harmoniously relate the development of the various tracts of land to the
existing community and facilitate the future development of adjoining
tracts.
9. To insure that public facilities are available and will have a sufficient
capacity to serve the proposed development.
10. To provide for and secure to the proper governmental agencies the actual
construction of all such necessary on-site and off-site public
improvements including the reservation or dedication of land for park and
recreational purposes.
11. To reserve or dedicate land for open space to preserve natural areas for
watercourses, drainage ways, woodland, rugged topography, wildlife
habitat, and for water quality and quantity, and to protect land from soil
erosion.
12. To coordinate the subdividing of land with applicable zoning regulations,
and other City regulations which affect the development of the land.
SECTION 1-3 AUTHORITY
1-301. These Subdivision Regulations and minimum standards for land development are
adopted by the Planning Commission and approved by the City Governing Body under
1-3
powers conferred by K.S.A. 12-749, K.S.A. 12-749(a) and Article 12, Section 5 of the
Constitution of the State of Kansas.
SECTION 1-4 POLICY
1-401.
a. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used safely for
building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood or other
menace nor unnecessarily subjecting existing development to such danger or
peril. It is further intended that land shall not be subdivided until proper provision
has been made for drainage, water and sewage and other necessary infrastructure.
b. The existing and proposed public improvements shall conform to and be properly
related to the features of the adopted Arkansas City Comprehensive Plan, and all
other adopted plans for specific aspects of the City, and adopted capital programs
and budgets.
SECTION 1-5 JURISDICTION
1-501. These regulations apply to all land within the corporate limits of the City of
Arkansas City, and land in unincorporated Cowley County which the City has identified
in its adopted Comprehensive Plan as its Growth Area.
SECTION 1-6 APPLICABILITY
1-601.
a. The regulations contained herein shall apply to the subdivision of a tract or parcel
of land into two or more lots, tracts or other divisions of land for the purpose of
sale or of building development, whether immediate or future, including the
resubdivision or replatting of land or lots. Division of land for agricultural
purposes, or single-family residential purposes, in parcels or tracts of land of
twenty (20) acres or more, and not involving right-of-way for streets or easements
and not involving the construction of other than agriculture buildings, shall be
exempt from the requirements of these regulations, provided, however that an
appropriate setback and easements be provided to protect long-term development
of roadways.
b. The owner(s) of any land subject to these regulations subdividing that land shall
prepare a subdivision plat in accordance with the provisions of these regulations.
No building or zoning permit shall hereafter be issued for construction on any
1-4
land that has not been subdivided in compliance with these regulations and all
other applicable state laws and local laws in effect at the time of the subdivision
of that land.
SECTION 1-7 EXEMPTIONS
1-701. The following transactions shall be exempt from these regulations.
a. Boundary adjustments between one or more contiguous lots, tracts, or parcels of
land, which will not create any additional lots, tracts or parcels, shall not be
subject to the subdivision platting, or replatting requirements of these regulations.
b. A conveyance of land, or interest therein, for use as right-of-way by railroad or
other public utilities subject to state or federal regulations where no new street or
easement of access is created.
c. A conveyance made to correct a bearing or distance description in a previously
recorded conveyance.
d. Any transfer by operation of law.
e. Any lot, parcel or tract of land located within the area governed by these
Subdivision Regulations which has been legally subdivided, resubdivided, platted
or replatted prior to the effective date of these regulations. For purposes of these
regulations, legally subdivided, resubdivided, platted or replatted shall include
any certificate of survey submitted and recorded, as provided by these
requirements, prior to the effective date of these regulations.
f. The division or further division of land into lots or tracts each of which contain
twenty (20) acres or more for single-family residential or agricultural use and
when such division does not involve or result in the creation of new streets,
easements of access, or other dedication.
g. The division of a lot, tract or parcel of land that existed prior to the effective date
of these regulations and was not previously exempted under any previous
subdivision regulations, where no more than one (1) additional lot, tract or parcel
is created, provided, however, that the creation of that additional lot, tract or
parcel shall comply with the provisions for lot splits set forth in Article 11 of
these regulations. Any further division of the lot, tract or parcel, including any
remainder parcel or tract, shall be platted in conformance with the requirements of
these regulations.
1-5
h. The division of a platted lot zoned and used for industrial purposes only, as
required by state law, provided each resulting lot has frontage on a public street.
SECTION 1-8 INTERPRETATIONS-CONFLICT
1-801.
a. Where a requirement of these regulations imposes restrictions that differ from
those requirements imposed by any other provision of these regulations or any
other statute, regulation, or other provision of law; the provision which imposes
the higher or more restrictive standard shall apply.
b. The provisions of these regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement,
covenant, or other private agreement.
c. A subdivision of land which was not lawfully existing at the time of the adoption
of these regulations shall not become or be made lawful solely by reason of the
adoption of these regulations.
d. The provision of these regulations are additional limitations upon all other laws
heretofore passed or which may be passed hereafter governing any subject matter
set forth in the provisions of these regulations.
SECTION 1-9 VESTING OF DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS
1-901. In conformance with the provisions of K.S.A. 12-764, and any subsequent
amendments thereto, the following rules regarding the vesting of development rights shall
apply:
a. The rights of landowners of properties platted or subdivided for low-density
residential development shall be protected for use of said land for the intended
residential purposes for a period of ten (10) years from the date upon which the
plat for such property was first recorded with the Cowley County Register of
Deeds. Provided, the division of land was legally done in conformance with the
Arkansas City Subdivision Regulations in effect at the time of such recording. If
construction is not commenced on such land within ten (10) years of recording a
plat the development rights in such shall expire.
b. For all purposes other than residential developments, the right to use land for a
particular purpose shall vest upon the issuance of all permits required for such use
by the City and construction has begun and substantial amounts of work have
been completed. If substantial amounts of the work have not been completed
within 10 years of the issuance of such permits, the development rights shall
expire.

d. Cul-de-sacs. Vehicular turnaround at the closed end of a street having a minimum
radius of fifty feet (50) and a roadway having a minimum radius of forty feet
(40) to the interior curb line. Such local street segment should not exceed five
hundred feet (500) in length from the intersection of a cross street to the juncture
with the cul-de-sac.
e. Right Angle Intersections. Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out to
intersect, as nearly as possible, at right angles. Where topography or other
conditions justify a variation from the right angle intersection, the minimum angle
shall be sixty (60) degrees.
4-4
f. Streets Adjacent to a Railroad Right-of-Way, Limited Access Freeway, Principal
Highway or Arterial Streets.
1. When the area to be subdivided adjoins a railroad right-of-way, the
intersection of the centerline of any street or highway paralleling the
railroad with that of any street that crosses the railroad shall not be less
than 140 feet from the line of the railroad right-of-way.
2. Where lots front or side, but do not back on railroad rights-of-way, limited
access freeways, principal highways, or arterial streets a marginal access
street or frontage road may be required parallel and adjacent to the
boundary of such rights-of-way. The distance from said rights-of-way
shall be determined with due consideration to minimum distance required
for approach connections to future grade-separated intersections.
g. Half-Streets. Half-streets shall be avoided, except:
1. Where they are essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision
in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations; or,
2. When the Planning Commission finds that it will be practical to require
the dedication of the other half of the street when the adjoining property is
subdivided. Where a half-street, or portion thereof, is existing and
adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be
based on minimum requirements as set forth in 4-301.j and shall be platted
within such tract.
h. Alleys. Alleys may be required in commercial, industrial and residential areas.
Dead end alleys shall be avoided, wherever possible; but if unavoidable, such
alleys shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead-end.

j. Additional Requirements. When existing or anticipated traffic on arterial and
collector streets warrants greater widths of rights-of-way, or where needed for
cuts, fills or utilities, additional right-of-way may be required to be dedicated for
any streets.
k. Street Grades.
1. The grades of streets, alleys and other public ways included in any
subdivision shall not be greater than five percent (5%) for major streets
and ten percent (10%) for local streets. Variations from these standards
may be made when warranted by topographic conditions. Such changes
shall be approved only upon the recommendation of the City Engineer.
2. Gutter grades on paved gutters shall not be less than one-half of one
percent (.5%).
3. All changes in street grades shall be connected by a vertical curb of
reasonable length to assure adequate visibility.
4-6
4. In approaching intersections, there should be a suitable leveling of the
street at a grade generally not exceeding four percent and for a distance of
generally not less than one hundred (100) feet from the nearest line of the
intersection street. The grade within the intersection should be as level as
possible, permitting proper drainage.
l. Street Alignment. Minimum horizontal and vertical alignment on all streets,
except in unusual cases, shall be as follows:
1. Horizontal alignment: Radii at the centerline.
Major streets .........................................................................500 feet
Local streets ..........................................................................150 feet
2. A tangent shall be provided between all reversed curves to provide for a
smooth traffic flow.
m. Vertical Alignment. All changes in street grade shall be connected by vertical
curves of such length as to provide for desired sight distance as set out in
American Association of State Highway Officials Geometric Design Standards
and shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
n. Street Layout. Proposed streets shall conform to topography as nearly as possible
to reduce drainage problems and grades.
o. Intersections.
1. Street intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least twenty (20) feet.
2. The design of the intersection should be such that a clear sight distance
will be maintained for seventy-five (75) feet at the roadway center line
with no obstruction to sight within the triangle formed by these points.
SECTION 4-4 LOT STANDARDS
4-401.
a. Minimum lot width shall be measured at the building setback line and shall not be
less than required by the zoning regulations of the district in which the
subdivision is located. No residential lots shall be less than seventy (70) feet in
width at the building line. Corner lots shall have a width at least twenty (20) feet
greater than the minimum width.
4-7
b. Minimum lot depth shall be one hundred and thirty (130) feet, measured through
the center of the lot and perpendicular to the property line, or radial to the
property line or curved streets.
c. Maximum depth of residential lots shall not exceed two and one-half (2 1/2) times
the width of the lot.
d. If the proposed subdivision is to be served with City water and City sewer or a
community-type sewage treatment plant, approval of the plat shall be subject to
the minimum requirements set forth in these regulations and the zoning
regulations of the district in which the subdivision is located.
e. If the proposed subdivision is to be served with a public water supply, but not
with a public sanitary sewer system, the preliminary plat will be submitted on the
basis of the minimum of three (3) acre lots and will be subject to the approval of
the City-Cowley County Health Department, which shall make or cause to be
made soil analysis and percolation tests for each lot and make recommendations
to the Planning Commission. The plat lots will be so proportioned as to permit
future re-platting consistent with good subdivision design.
f. If the proposed subdivision is not served with either an approved public water
supply or an approved public sanitary sewer system and the developer will be
using a private water supply with an approved private sewage disposal system, the
subdivider shall submit his or her preliminary plat on the basis of ten (10) acre
lots, subject to the approval of the Health Department, which shall secure soil
analysis and percolation tests and submit a recommendation to the Planning
Commission. The lots will be so proportioned as to permit future re-platting
consistent with good subdivision design.
g. All side lot lines shall bear sixty (60) to ninety (90) degrees from the street rightof-
way line on a straight street or from the tangent of a curved street.
h. Double frontage lots and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided unless, in the
opinion of the Planning Commission, a variation to this prohibition will give
better street alignment and lot arrangement.
i. Every lot shall have frontage on a public street other than an alley.
j. The subdivision or re-subdivision of a tract or lot shall not be permitted where
said subdivision or re-subdivision places an existing permanent structure in
violation of the requirements of the zoning regulations or the minimum design
standards of these regulations.
k. Whenever possible, residential lots shall not face on arterial streets. The number
of lots facing on collector streets shall be kept to a minimum in each subdivision.
4-8
The street pattern shall be designed so that the side line of lots abut collector
streets wherever land shapes and topography permit.
l. In subdivisions located outside the city limits, plats with lots which exceed the
minimum areas or dimensions set out in these regulations may be denied upon a
determination that such lots, if platted, will obstruct the future growth and
development of the area, for example by making the extension of municipal
services uneconomical.
SECTION 4-5 EASEMENTS
4-501.
a. Where alleys are not provided, permanent easements of not less than ten (10) feet
in width shall be provided on each side of all rear lot lines, and on side lot lines,
where necessary, for utility poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas,
water and heat mains, and other public utilities. Where a utility company or other
service provider can demonstrate the need for a wider easement than required
above for a specific location, such may be required by the Governing Body and
provided by the developer. These easements shall provide for a continuous rightof-
way at least twenty (20) feet in width. An additional twelve (12) foot wide
temporary construction easement abutting each side of a utility easement shall be
provided for initial construction of water, sewer and other utility lines. Such
temporary easement shall be terminated by the City upon its determination that
development of lots adjoining the easement is completed with all utilities fully
installed.
b. All easements shall be shown on the plat. Permanent easements shall not be
obstructed by structures or vegetation. No fences may be placed in storm drain
easements located along side lot lines. A property owner may otherwise erect
fences and landscape the easement at his or her own risk of loss.
c. Drainage Easements. If a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage
way or channel, then a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way shall be
provided. Such easement or right-of-way shall conform substantially to the lines
of the natural water course and shall be of such width or construction, or both, as
may be necessary to provide adequate stormwater drainage and for access for
maintenance thereof. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection
therewith. The City Engineer shall make a study and report his or her
recommendation to the Planning Commission as to the desired width of such
easement. Such study and report shall be based on the one hundred year flood
depth (if known). Maintenance of stormwater easements and drainage right-ofway
shall be the responsibility of the owners of property adjoining such
easements or right-of-way.
4-9
d. Where a lot or group of lots side or back on an existing high pressure oil line or
existing high pressure gas line, a seventy-five foot (75) easement shall be
provided on each side of said oil line or gas line. The seventy-five foot (75)
easement shall be provided on that part of the lot which abuts the oil line or gas
line, and no building or structure shall be located or constructed within said
seventy-five foot (75) easement.
SECTION 4-6 DESIGN TECHNIQUES
4-601. Subdivision Design: The design of the subdivision shall provide for efficient
traffic flow, proper mixing of land uses, and a logical link between surrounding, existing
development, and the proposed layout. The Planning Commission shall have the
authority to deny a plat or request redesign, if, in its opinion, the layout is not suitable for
the site, or if the development of the subdivision would be premature.
SECTION 4-7 ACCESS CONTROL
4-701. In the interest of public safety and for the preservation of the traffic carrying
capacity of the street system, the Planning Commission shall have the right to regulate
points of access to all property from the public streets system. Such proscriptions shall
be indicated on the final plat.
SECTION 4-8 LAND SUBJECT TO FLOODING
4-801.
a. Land subject to intermediate regional flood shall not be subdivided for any use
incompatible with such flooding. An intermediate regional flood is a flood
having an average frequency of occurrence in the order of once in 100 years,
although the flood may occur in any year or even in successive years. It is based
on statistical analyses of stream flow records available for the watershed and
analyses of rainfall and runoff characteristics in the general region of the
watershed. Data on the flood characteristics for the planning area may be
obtained from the Kansas Water Resources Board or the Corps of Engineers, U.S.
Army, and FEMA.
b. Subdivision proposals shall include regulatory flood elevation data in areas zoned
Floodway or Floodplain on the Arkansas City Zoning Map.
c. Adequate drainage shall be provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
d. All public utilities and facilities shall be located so as to minimize or eliminate
flood damage.
4-10
e. All proposed development shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage.
SECTION 4-9 BUILDING LINES
4-901. Building lines conforming with zoning regulations shall be shown on all lots
within the platted area. Provisions shall be made by the owner's declaration of plat,
requiring all enclosed parts of buildings to be set back to such building lines.

DEDICATION OR RESERVATION OF PUBLIC SITES
AND OPEN SPACE
Sections:
5-1 Dedication and Reservation of Public Sites and Open Spaces
5-2 Dedication and Reservation of Public Park Land
5-3 Action by Governing Body
5-4 Use of Land and Fees
SECTION 5-1 DEDICATION AND RESERVATION OF PUBLIC SITES AND
OPEN SPACES
5-101. In subdividing land or re-subdividing an existing plat, due consideration should be
given by the subdivider to the dedication or reservation of suitable sites for schools,
parks, playgrounds, or other public recreational areas or open spaces. In its consideration
of any such subdividing or resubdividing the Planning Commission shall make
recommendations as to dedications and reservations. Any area so dedicated or reserved
shall conform as nearly as possible to the recommendations of the Planning Commission.
All areas to be reserved for, or dedicated to, public use shall be indicated on the
preliminary plat in order that it may be determined when and in what manner such areas
will be dedicated or acquired.
SECTION 5-2 DEDICATION AND RESERVATION OF PUBLIC PARK LAND
5-201. General Requirement. In subdividing or resubdividing land zoned and intended
for residential use, the developer shall dedicate or reserve land for public park purposes,
or pay a fee in lieu of dedication, or select a combination of dedication or reservation and
a fee. The method chosen to meet this requirement shall be determined by the developer
with consideration given to the standards set out in these regulations and the
recommendation of the Planning Commission.
5-202. Amount of Dedication. The number of acres of land required to be dedicated or
reserved shall be determined as follows, based on the density of development as
permitted by the zoning of the property being subdivided. The area required to be
dedicated or reserved shall be exclusive of all street rights-of-way and stormwater
easements.
Percent of Total Land Area Being Subdivided to be Dedicated or Reserved for Park
Purposes: CS Countryside  2%; R-1 Low Density Residential  5%; R-2 Medium
Density Residential  6%; R-3 High Density Residential  8%.
5-2
5-203. Location and Design Standards. Any land dedicated or reserved shall conform
with the Comprehensive Plan of the City. The location, size and configuration of the
land to be dedicated or reserved shall be determined by the design of the streets, lots, and
blocks of the subdivision with consideration given to the preservation of natural physical
features.
All lands to be dedicated or reserved shall meet the following standards:
a. No dedications or reservations shall be required from subdivisions comprised of
less than twenty (20) acres.
b. The land shall contain not less than two (2) contiguous acres and be a minimum
of two hundred (200) feet at the narrowest dimension.
c. The land shall have at least two hundred (200) feet of street frontage and be easily
accessible to residents of adjacent subdivisions. Consideration shall be given to
placing parks where they can be added to by future subdivisions.
d. At least fifty percent (50%) of the land shall have a grade of less than four percent
(4%). The balance may consist of steep slopes, streams, ditches, lakes or other
natural features.
e. Natural features such as wooded areas, streams, and other natural assets shall be
preserved whenever possible.
5-204. Payment in Lieu of Dedication or Reservation. In the event the land to be
dedicated or reserved is less than the amount of acreage required or the land does not
meet the location and design standards, the payment of a fee in lieu of dedication or
reservation may be required. The fee shall be based on the total number of dwelling units
permitted within the subdivision times a fee schedule for each dwelling unit type. The
fee schedule shall be as established by ordinance adopted by the Governing Body.
Any fees collected shall be placed in a neighborhood park account and used for
improvement of neighborhood parks including acquisition of land. A record of fees paid
into and expended from the fund shall be kept by the City. In the event funds have not
been expended on such purposes within fifteen (15) years from the date received the fees
shall be refunded in the following manner:
a. If paid in full at the time of platting, to the developer.
b. If paid at the time of the building permit, to the record property owner at the time
of the refund.
5-205. Credit for Private Open Space. Private open space for park and recreational
purposes within a proposed development may be credited for up to fifty percent (50%) of
5-3
the requirement for dedication or reservation of public park land or payment of a fee in
lieu thereof provided that the following standards are met:
a. That yards, setbacks and other open areas required by zoning and building
regulations shall not be included in computing the area set aside as private open
space.
b. That the private open space shall be reasonably useable for park and recreation
purposes.
c. That the private open space shall be perpetually restricted for park and recreation
purposes by recorded plat or restrictive covenant.
d. That the private open space shall be permanently owned and maintained by the
owner of the development or by a legally established homeowners association.
5-206. Indication on Preliminary Plat. At the time of the preliminary plat submittal,
the developer shall indicate whether a dedication or reservation of land or a fee in lieu of
dedication is being proposed. Any land proposed to be dedicated or reserved shall be
shown on the preliminary plat.
5-207. Prerequisite for Final Plat Approval. When land is being dedicated it shall be
shown on the final plat and marked Dedicated for Public Park Purposes. Such
dedications shall not be effective until the dedication has been specifically accepted by
the Governing Body.
When a fee in lieu of dedication is required, total payment shall be made prior to final
plat approval by the Governing Body or, at the option of the developer, payment may be
made at the time of issuance of a building permit on each individual lot. In the latter
case, the fee shall be in accordance with the fee schedule referenced in section 5-204.
5-208. Reservation of Park Land. The Governing Body may determine that the
reservation of park land for future dedication is more appropriate than immediate
dedication of such land. In such cases, the land to be reserved shall be shown on the final
plat and marked Reserved for Public Park Purposes and a covenant shall be written on
the recorded plat indicating the latest date, time and manner in which dedication shall
occur. Such future dedications shall be at no cost to the City except for the
reimbursement of any costs paid by the owner for street, utility, drainage, and other
public improvements benefiting the reserved land.
SECTION 5-3 ACTION BY GOVERNING BODY
5-301. Upon receiving the recommendations of the Planning Commission, the
Governing Body may:
5-4
a. Accept dedication or reservation of land.
b. Accept, in lieu of the dedication of land, a fee in accordance with a fee ordinance
adopted by the Governing Body.
c. Waive the requirement if the Governing Body finds that there are sufficient
schools, parks, playgrounds or other publicly-owned or operated recreational
areas or open spaces in the area of the subdivision.
SECTION 5-4 USE OF LAND AND FEES
5-401. Land or fees obtained pursuant to this Article shall only be used to obtain public
open space, public recreational land or facilities for public use. The Governing Body
shall make appropriate findings as to the relationship between the subdivision from which
the fees were obtained and such open space, recreational land or facilities for public use.

be forwarded to the City Engineer who will prepare a written
analysis of the plan for consideration by the Planning Commission.
b. Review by Utility Advisory Committee. Upon the receipt of the copies of the
preliminary plat, the Zoning Administrator shall send a copy of the plat to each
member of the Utility Advisory Committee. The Utility Advisory Committee
shall review said plat and submit its recommendations to the Planning
Commission.
c. Approval or Disapproval of Preliminary Plat. Action by the Planning
Commission shall be conveyed to the subdivider in writing within fifteen (15)
business days after the Planning Commission meeting at which time the plat was
considered and action was taken thereon. Approval of the preliminary plat by the
Planning Commission does not constitute an acceptance of the subdivision, but is
rather merely an authorization for the subdivider to proceed with the preparation
of the final plat. In cases where the plat is disapproved, the subdivider shall be
notified of the reason for such action and what requirements shall be necessary to
meet the approval of the Planning Commission. If the Planning Commission fails
to approve or disapprove a preliminary plat within sixty (60) days after the plat
has been submitted for consideration, then such preliminary plat shall be deemed
to have been approved, unless the subdivider shall have consented to extend or
waive such time limitation.
d. Area to be Platted. In order to ensure that the provisions of these regulations are
carried out and that the overall subdivision design is prepared in an orderly
manner, the Planning Commission may require that a preliminary plat be
submitted on all contiguous land under common ownership rather than a parcel or
segment. The area may, however, be final platted in smaller parcels or segments
as directed by the Planning Commission.
e. Effective Date. The approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective for a
period of twelve (12) consecutive months, unless an extension of time is granted
by the Planning Commission. If the final plat has not been submitted for approval
within this period, or extended period, a preliminary plat must be submitted again
to the Planning Commission for approval.
SECTION 6-4 FINAL PLATS
6-401.

in escrow after the final completion of such improvements.
9-2
4. The subdivider shall agree that the deposit in escrow may be held by the
Governing Body for a period of 18 months after such improvements are
completed for the purpose of:
(a) Guaranteeing and securing the correction of any defect in material
or workmanship furnished for such improvements, latent in
character, and not discernible at the time of final inspection or
acceptance by the Governing Body; and
(b) Guarantee against any damage to such improvements by reason of
the settling of the ground, base or foundation thereof.
(c) Such escrow agreement shall provide that, as such defects have so
developed, that the deposit may be applied by the Governing Body
for any amounts incurred correcting such defects; and that the
balance of such deposit, if any, held at the end of such 18-month
period shall be returned by the Governing Body to the depositor, or
paid to the order of the depositor without payment of interest.
b. Petitions to the Governing Body may be submitted as a means of guaranteeing the
authority to install improvements at such time as the Governing Body deems
appropriate. Petitions may be submitted only when the following conditions
exist:
1. The petitions must be brought in the manner set out under Kansas law.
2. The petitions must be approved by the Governing Body concurrently with
the acceptance of the final plat.
3. The initiating resolution for such improvement must be adopted by the
Governing Body concurrently with the petition approval or as soon
thereafter as may be provided by law.
4. A certificate signed by the petitioner must be recorded with the Cowley
County Register of Deeds stating that such petitions have been filed and
approved by the Governing Body and that certain land within the plat as
described will be liable in the future for special assessment for the
required improvements authorized.
Such a preconstruction procedure shall be temporarily conditioned on subsequent
acceptance of the final plat and a time limit for actual construction mutually
agreed upon. Maintenance guarantees may also be required by the Governing
Body.

c. The subdivider shall, prior to the acceptance of the final plat, submit a letter from
the utility provider(s) involved stating that satisfactory arrangements have been
made by the subdivider guaranteeing the installation of their respective services.
d. Monuments and benchmarks shall be installed in accordance with the
requirements of these regulations and their installation certified by a licensed land
surveyor on the final plat before such plat is recorded with the Cowley County
Register of Deeds.
SECTION 9-2 OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS
9-201. The Governing Body may, upon making a finding of necessity, require the
subdivider to install or upgrade off-site improvements located outside the perimeter of a
subdivision. Such off-site improvements should be within dedicated rights-of-way or
easements and serve a public purpose. The financing and guaranteeing of such
improvements shall be administered as if they were the same as on-site improvements.
The Governing Body may require such subdivision to participate in any or all of the
following facilities and improvements, or any other off-site improvements as
recommended by the Planning Commission, if the need is created by a proposed
subdivision and the requirement is one the City may lawfully require:
a. Drainage improvements and drainageways;
b. Pedestrian ways;
c. Screening and landscaping;
d. Grading;
e. Street improvements;
f. Traffic control devices;

not more than two buildable lots which meet the minimum size and area requirements for the
zoning district in which said lots are located without having to comply with the platting
requirements described in Article 6 of these Regulations. The new lots cannot, thereafter, be
further subdivided without replatting. The Zoning Administrator may approve or disapprove lot
splits in accordance with the requirements of this Article.
11-102. A property owner shall apply for a lot split prior to the construction or placement of a
non-abutting, non-accessory building or other structure on a lot already containing a building or
other structure if the new lot, building or structure (a) has a different owner than the rest of the lot
or (b) the new building or other structure may create increases in service requirements or interfere
with maintaining existing services levels, such as those described in Section 11-301(a)(3).
11-103. No building permit shall be issued for any structure to be located on a lot produced
by a lot split until (a) the lot split has been approved by the Zoning Administrator in accordance
with the requirements of this Article, or (b) upon which a lot split has been denied under Section
11-301(a) without thereafter complying with Article 6 of these Regulations.

these Subdivision Regulations, and all other applicable regulations.
a. No lot split shall be approved if any of the following applies:
1. A new street or alley is needed or proposed.
2. A vacation of streets, alleys, setback lines, access control or easements is
required or proposed.
3. If such action will result in significant increases in service requirements, e.g.,
utilities, schools, traffic control, streets, etc.; or will interfere with maintaining
existing service levels, e.g., additional curb cuts, repaving, etc.
4. If there is less street right-of-way than required by these regulations or the
Comprehensive Plan unless such dedication can be made by separate instrument.
5. If all easement requirements have not been satisfied.
6. If such splits will result in a tract without direct access to a public street.
7. If a substandard sized lot or parcel will be created, unless a variance for the lot or
parcel has been approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
8. If the lot has been previously split in accordance with these regulations.
b. The Zoning Administrator may make such additional requirements as deemed necessary
to carry out the intent and purpose of existing land development regulations and policy.
Requirements may include, but not be limited to, installation of public improvements and
dedication of rights-of-way and easements.
SECTION 11-4 STAFF REVIEW AND ACTION
11-401. The Zoning Administrator shall, in writing, either approve with or without conditions
or disapprove the lot split within thirty (30) days of application. If approved, and after all
conditions have been met, the Zoning Administrator shall sign and furnish a certificate of
approval to be affixed to the lot split survey, and a certified copy thereof shall be filed with the
Cowley County Register of Deeds, the official designated to issue building or occupancy permits,
and a copy shall be furnished to the applicant.

SECTION 12-3 CORRECTION OF PLATTING ERRORS
12-301. If, after recording a final plat, an error is found in distances, angles, bearings,
subdivision or street names, block or lot numbers, the computation of dimension or
elevation or other details of the plat, except in connection with the outer boundaries of the
plat, and if the property described in that part of the plat containing the error is under the
ownership of the same person who caused the plat to be prepared, the City Engineer, after
substantiation of the existence of the error, may file an affidavit with the Cowley County
Register of Deeds that the error was made. The affidavit shall describe the nature and
extent of the error and the appropriate correction. The Cowley County Register of Deeds
shall record the affidavit and shall place in the margin of the recorded plat a notation that
the affidavit has been filed, the date of filing and the book and page where it is recorded.
The filing of the affidavit shall correct any errors, but shall have no effect on the validity
of the plat or any property interest recorded by reference thereto. A copy of the recorded
affidavit shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator.
SECTION 12-4 VACATION OF STREETS, ALLEYS, EASEMENTS AND
PLATS
12-401.
a. The following procedures are provided to vacate streets, alleys or other public
reservations such as, but not limited to public easements, dedicated building
setback lines, access control, or a part thereof, and including all or parts of
recorded plats within the corporate limits of the City:
1. Petitions for vacations received from the Governing Body, the owner of
platted land or the owner of land adjoining on both sides of any street,
12-3
alley, easement or other public reservation may be filed with the Zoning
Administrator.
2. The petition shall be reviewed by and comments submitted to the Planning
Commission by the Utility Advisory Committee.
3. Following its receipt of the comments of the Utility Advisory Committee,
the Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the Governing
Body as to whether the vacation should be approved or disapproved and
with or without conditions attached. If the Planning Commission
determines that:
(a) due and legal notice has been given;
(b) no private rights will be injured or endangered; and
(c) the public will suffer no loss or inconvenience;
then the Planning Commission shall recommend that such vacation be
approved and entered at length in the minutes. Such recommendation may
provide for the reservation to the City and/or the owners of any lesser
property rights for public utilities, rights-of-way and easements for public
service facilities originally located in such vacated land or planned for the
future. The petition shall not be recommended by the Planning
Commission nor granted by the Governing Body if a written objection is
filed with the City Clerk by any owner who would be a proper party to the
petition, but has not joined therein. Furthermore, when only a portion of a
street, alley or public reservation is proposed to be vacated, the petition
shall not be recommended by the Planning Commission nor granted by the
Governing Body if a written objection is filed with the City Clerk by any
owner of lands which adjoin the portion to be vacated. The
recommendation of the Planning Commission to the Governing Body shall
be made as provided by K.S.A. 12-752 for the submission and approval of
a final plat, and the Governing Body may approve or disapprove the
vacation or approve it with or without reservation of lesser easements than
as recommended by the Planning Commission.

SECTION 13-1 INTENT
13-101.
a. The very nature of land development creates potential for traffic congestion,
overcrowding, adverse visual environmental impacts, and health problems. Also,
the City strives to achieve the goal of promoting growth in Arkansas City, while
stabilizing the established residential patterns of the area. The City seeks to
ensure that any location that accommodates intense urban use be subject to Site
Plan Review by the zoning administrator in accordance with this Article. Site
Plan Review helps ensure that the meaning and intent of these subdivision
regulations are fully complied with and so property owners and developers
understand City requirements under these regulations before projects begin.
b. Site Plan Review regulates the development of structures and sites in a manner
that considers the following:
1. The balancing of landowners rights to use their land, with the
corresponding rights of abutting and neighboring landowners to live
without undue disturbances, including, for example, noise, smoke, fumes,
dust, odor, glare and stormwater runoff;
2. The convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement within
the site, and in relation to adjacent areas or roads;
3. The adequacy of waste disposal methods and protection from pollution of
surface or groundwater;
4. The protection of historic and natural environmental features of the site
under review, and those of adjacent areas; and
Amended 2-16-16
13-2
5. The stability of the built environment, particularly residential
neighborhoods, by promoting urban development that is compatible with
clearly identified natural resources.
SECTION 13-2 APPLICABILITY
13-201.
a. The Zoning Administrator shall require that all applications for building permits
for residential, commercial and industrial developments, other than applications
for accessory buildings, be subject to site plan review in accordance with these
regulations, and for redevelopments which enlarge the size of the original
structure by more than fifty percent (50%) in the case of a renovation or
alteration. The Zoning Administrator may require a site plan review in
accordance with the regulations for any development requiring a building permit
upon a determination that such development may impact parking, storm water,
traffic or create other impacts upon public health, safety or welfare. The Zoning
Administrator may require a site plan review regardless of whether a development
involves the subdivision of land. Developments shall be encouraged to
implement the objectives of the adopted City of Arkansas City Comprehensive
Plan to foster compatibility among land uses in the City.
b. Prior to application, a pre-application conference shall be held between the
applicant and city staff to discuss the site review requirement and other site or
application issues specific to the proposed development or redevelopment. The
applicant should submit preliminary plans for initial review and comment at this
time.
SECTION 13-3 AUTHORITY
13-301. Building permits shall not be issued for any use of land or proposed construction
for which site plan review is applicable, unless site plan review approval has been
granted.
SECTION 13-4 FILING FEE
13-401. A filing fee shall be paid as part of the plan review fee at or prior to the time of
building permit application in an amount established by the City Commission by

b. The extent to which the development would be compatible with the surrounding
area.
c. The extent to which the proposal conforms to the provisions of the Citys zoning
regulations and/or comprehensive plan.
d. The extent to which the proposal conforms to the standard specifications used in
the City.
Amended 2-16-16
13-6
e. The extent to which the location of streets, paths, walkways, and driveways are
located so as to enhance safety and minimize any adverse traffic impact on the
surrounding area.
SECTION 13-7 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
13-701. Other than one- and two-family dwelling units, no building shall be erected that
does not meet the following minimum standards:
a. Rooftop equipment shall be screened from view from the ground near the building
with vertical extensions of the building walls or with parapets or other
architectural design features of the same materials used on the wall of the
building. Where the topography permits, it is desirable to screen such equipment
from adjacent property, but it is not the intent of this requirement to increase the
height of the screening significantly above that of the equipment in order to
screen it from view from tall buildings or from higher ground. Raised exterior
walls or screen walls should be designed to enclose groups of equipment.
b. Dumpster Enclosure and Improvements:
1. Exterior refuse shall be kept in an enclosed area large enough to contain
one weeks production of refuse and shall be contained in a refuse bin
equipped with a lid.
2. The enclosure shall be a minimum of 12 feet wide to allow access for the
truck picking up the refuse bin. The depth of the enclosure should be the
depth of the refuse bin being used plus an additional four (4) feet to allow
for the mechanical dumping of the refuse bin. The enclosure shall have a
minimum height of five (5) feet.
3. The floor of the enclosure shall be reinforced concrete with a minimum
thickness of four inches (4) with #4 reinforcing at twenty-four inches
(24") each direction.
4. There shall be a 12' x 12' concrete pad in front of the enclosure. This pad
should be a minimum depth of eight inches (8") and have #4 reinforcing
rods every twenty-four inches (24") in each direction, and have a test
strength of 4,000 psi.
5. The enclosure should be shielded on three sides by a wall or decorative
fence and positioned in such a manner to shield the refuse bins from sight
of any public thoroughfare or adjoining property to extent possible. When
decorative fence is used the corner post should be made of steel pipe with
a four-inch (4) diameter and filled with concrete.
Amended 2-16-16
13-7
6. The number and location of refuse bins shall be located on site plans prior
to approval.
c. The form and proportion of building should be consistent or compatible with the
scale, form and proportion of existing development in the immediate area.
d. The rhythm of structural mass to voids, such as windows and glass doors, of a
front facade should relate favorably to the rhythms established in adjacent
buildings.
e. Overly long horizontal facades (walls) should be articulated with variations in the
building plane and parapet height, materials and colors, entrance canopies,
landscaping and other design or site plan features. Parking lots along the facade
can also relieve horizontally through the use of landscaped fingers and island
containing trees and shrubs.
f. Architectural design should create visual interest through the use of different
textures, complementary colors, shadow lines and contrasting shapes. The use of
walls in a single color, with little detailing or completely bland, is discouraged.
g. Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided.
Variation of detail, form, and siting shall be used to provide visual interest.
h. Careful consideration of durable materials, proportions, and shapes, emphasizing
the importance of roofs as integral and embracing elements of the over-all design,
is encouraged.
i. Use of masonry materials (face brick, stucco, stone) is encouraged. The use of
aluminum siding, metal ribbed panels, and extensive mirrored glass surfaces is
discouraged. Evaluation of building materials shall be based on the quality of its
design and relationship and compatibility to building materials in the immediate
neighborhood. Corrugated metal facades should be complemented with abundant
use of masonry, whether brick, stone, stucco or split-face block, especially along
perimeter streets. Architectural metal panels may be an acceptable substitute for
masonry. Appropriate landscaping can be used to complement and enhance a
buildings design, color and material.
j. Architectural treatments (e.g., building material, colors, facade design, roof lines,
screening) shall be consistent and compatible on all sides. Treatment that is
uniform on all sides will be deemed to meet the requirements of this principle.
Adjacent land uses, visibility from public streets, use of screening devices (walls,
fences, berms, landscaping) are criteria to be considered when varying this
treatment.
13-702. Mini-warehouse facilities shall be developed in accordance with the following
minimum standards:
Amended 2-16-16
13-8
a. Off street parking shall be provided as follows:
1. Parking shall be provided by parking/driving lanes adjacent to the
buildings. These lanes shall be at least twenty feet (20) wide for one-way
access lanes and at least twenty-five feet (25) wide for two-way access
lanes.
2. One parking space for every one hundred fifty (150) storage cubicles shall
be located adjacent to the leasing office. A minimum of three (3) such
spaces shall be required.
3. Required parking spaces may not be rented as or used for vehicle storage,
unless identified on the site plan or development plan.
b. There shall be landscaped screening and fencing around the perimeter of the
project. The fencing shall be a minimum of six feet (6) in height. When a
development borders an arterial street, adjoining residential or commercial
development, the fence shall be constructed of decorative material approved by
the Zoning Administrator along those sides. Chain link fencing may be used on
sides that adjoin other industrial property of similar or greater intensity, as
approved by the Zoning Administrator.
c. The buildings shall be architecturally compatible with the existing neighborhood.
To that end, newly constructed mini-warehouse storage units either shall (a)
install a screen to shield door openings from residentially zoned property and
public right-of-way, or (b) face door openings away from any residentially zoned
property or public right-of-way.
