PREFACE 
    This Code is a codification of the ordinances of Plymouth, Connecticut of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative table appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the twenty-first section of Chapter 10 is 10-21. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 8-48 and 8-49 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 8-48.1, 8-48.2, and 8-48.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 7 and 8, it will be designated as Chapter 7.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to former Mayor Donna Warkoski. and Ms. Janet P. Scoville, Town Clerk, and Mr. Stephen O. Allaire, former Town Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

Conviction for the commission of a felony or misdemeanor, malfeasance, and/or conduct, which is in direct and serious violation of the procedures and ethical standards contained in section 3, chapter IX of this charter shall be considered sufficient cause for recall. Said petition shall be filed with said clerk not later than thirty (30) days from the day the first copy or page thereof was received from or approved by said clerk as provided in said section 7-9 and it shall be signed in ink or indelible pencil by electors of the town equal in number to at least fifteen (15) percent of the electors registered at the last regular municipal election, provided, no recall petition may be filed against any officer until he has held his office for at least six (6) months.

Said recall vote shall be called and conducted in the same manner as is provided in the General Statutes for the call and conduct of a special election. The form of the question to be voted upon shall be substantially as follows: "Shall (here insert the name and title of the elective officer whose recall is sought) be recalled?" A majority vote of the electors to recall such elective officer shall not be effective unless a total of at least twenty (20) percent of the electors entitled to vote on the question shall have voted. Recall of such elective officer shall become effective upon certification of the results of the voting thereon regardless of any defect in the recall petition.

(Amend. of 11-8-2005, § 1B) 
Section 8. - Determination of sufficiency. 
    The town clerk shall, upon filing of any petition for nomination or election, proceed forthwith to determine its sufficiency by comparing the name of the candidate and the signatures thereon with the latest official lists of the registrars of voters and with petitions already filed for the same office. If the town clerk finds the petition insufficient, he shall notify the candidate in writing forthwith and no further proceedings shall be had thereon except in accordance with an order of a judge of the Superior court of Litchfield County to whom an appeal may be taken from the decision of the town clerk, providing, nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing, in the case of petitions found to be insufficient, the obtaining of additional valid signatures and the refiling of the petition for nomination within the time limits prescribed for the presentation of the original petition. Any such petition shall be recorded as of the time it is refiled. 
CHAPTER III. - THE TOWN COUNCIL

The council is authorized, in adopting ordinances, to incorporate any nationally recognized code, rules or regulations that have been printed in book form, or any code officially adopted by any administrative agency of the state, or any portion thereof, by reference thereto in such ordinance; provided, upon adoption of any such ordinance wherein such code, rules or regulations or portions thereof have been incorporated by reference, there shall be maintained two (2) copies of such code, rules or regulations in the office of the town clerk for examination by the public.

In matters that are unethical, fraudulent, or of grave seriousness, immediate action can be taken. Due process proceedings must be afforded such membership activities and actions related to this section. The town council must have a quorum, and a majority of those present must vote in favor of such action. 
(11-7-89; Amend. of 11-5-2002) 
Section 5a. - Power of initiative.

All persons and all other legal entities having ownership of or control over such pipes or conduits, shall comply with all such orders within such time as the orders of the town council shall specify. Such orders shall be in writing, signed by the town clerk, under authority of the town council, and attested copies thereof shall be served upon such persons or other legal entities, in person or by mail by registered letter, at least forty-eight (48) hours before the work specified therein shall be required to begin.

(c)  When a street shall have been laid out, altered, extended or discontinued, or when the town council shall have ordered any other public improvement by which land or other property is taken for public use by right of eminent domain or special damages or benefits are caused to property, or both, and no special provision is made in the section under which such public improvement is ordered for the appraisal of damages or assessments of benefits, the town council shall, by itself or by a committee appointed by it therefor, appraise the damages and assess the special benefits resulting from such improvement. Unless the damages and benefits so appraised and assessed shall be consented to in writing by the owner of the property affected, which written consent shall be filed with the town clerk, the town council or its committee shall, before finally adopting its appraisal of damages or assessment of benefits, give to such owners a public hearing and shall give such owners at least fifteen (15) days' notice of the time and place of such hearing and of the sums proposed to be appraised as damages and assessed as benefits, or both, such notice to be given in the mode hereinafter specified as to notices of assessments. After such hearing, the town council or its committee shall adopt a final report and file the same with the town clerk. 
(d)  The town clerk shall, thereupon, cause written notices to be served upon each owner of property affected by such appraisal or assessment of the amount awarded to him as damages, the amount assessed against him as special benefits and the net amount to be paid by the town to him or by him to the town, as the case may be. Service of such notice shall be made by some civil officer, policeman, of said town or indifferent person, by leaving a copy of such notice, signed by the town clerk, with or at the usual place of abode of each owner, or by certified mail, as directed by the town council. Service on non-residents of the Town of Plymouth shall be by certified or registered mail addressed to their last-known place of abode. The person serving such notice shall make return of the manner and time of such service to the town clerk. 
(e)  In making assessments of benefits and appraisals or damages for any public improvement, the Town of Plymouth is authorized to assess such benefits or appraise such damages as it may deem just, upon or in favor of the real estate belonging to the state situated within the limits of the Town of Plymouth and specially benefited or damaged by such public improvement, subject to appeal as provided by law. In the case of assessment of benefits against or appraisal of damages in favor of the state, the state treasurer shall pay any assessment of benefits upon certification by the clerk of said town that the same are due, and shall receive damages assessed in favor of the state and give a receipt for the same upon like certification. 
(f)  Any owner of land or property taken for such public improvement and each person against whom special benefits have been assessed, who is aggrieved by such report, may appeal therefrom within one (1) month from the service upon him of such notice. Such appeal shall be by writ and complaint served upon the mayor or town clerk at least twelve (12) days before the return day, and shall be returnable to the court of common pleas for Litchfield County on the next return day of said court or the judge of said court on the first Tuesday of the next month after the expiration of the twelve (12) days, if said court shall be in vacation on that day. The complaint shall recite the appraisal of damages and assessment of benefits made to the appellant, and allege that the amount to be paid by the town to the appellant is too small, or the amount paid by the appellant to the town is too large, as the case may be. Such appeal shall open both the appraisal of damages and the assessment of benefits to the appellant for review, although the appellant may have appealed from only one of such awards. Upon the return of such writ and complaint, the court or judge shall appoint a committee of three (3) disinterested persons, who, after being sworn and giving reasonable notice to the parties, shall appraise the damages and assess the special benefits and report to said court such appraisal and assessment, and the net sum to be paid by the town to the appellant or by the appellant to the town, as the case may be. Remonstrance may be made to the report of such committee for any legal error [or] irregularity in the performance of its duties; and, if upon such remonstrance the report shall be rejected, the court shall appoint another committee; otherwise the report of the committee shall be accepted by the court or judge and shall have the effect of a judgment in favor of the party to whom the net payment is to be made, subject to the provisions in regard to the time of payment hereinafter contained. Said court or such judge may tax such costs of such appeal in favor of either party as it may deem equitable. 
(g)  When the report of the town council or its committee or appraisal shall have been adopted and filed with the town clerk, the town shall have the right to enter upon the land and construct the street or other public improvements, and its right so to proceed shall not be suspended by the bringing or pendency of an appeal. Upon the filing of such report, the owner in favor of whom any appraisal has been made shall have the right to demand the net sum due to him under such award; and the acceptance of such sum shall be a waiver of his right to appeal. The right of any appellant to receive the sum awarded to him shall be suspended during the pendency of such appeal; but, upon the acceptance of the committee report by the court or the judge, the net sum adjudged to him shall immediately become due and payable. 
(h)  The amount of special benefits assessed against any person in excess of damages appraised to him shall be a debt from him to said town, but such debt shall not be due or collectible until the completion of such public improvement. When such improvement has been completed, the town council shall pass a resolution declaring that fact and thereupon such assessment shall be due and payable; and the town clerk shall give notice thereof to each person against whom such benefits were assessed or their legal representative in case of their death, in the manner herein, provided for notice of assessment. All assessments made for public improvements within the Town of Plymouth shall bear interest from date when the same shall become due, payable at such rate as the town council of said town shall prescribe. 
(i)  Such net assessment shall be a lien upon the land against which it was assessed from and after the report of the town council or its committee of appraisal, which lien shall take priority over all other liens or taxes due the state, except that no such lien shall remain in force for more than sixty (60) days after the date set by the town council for the payment of the assessment or any part thereof, unless a certificate of lien shall, within said sixty (60) days, be filed in the land records of said town. Said certificate shall describe the land covered by such lien and shall be indexed in the name of the person against whom such assessment was made, and also in the name of the present owner of the land, if a different person. 
(Amend. of 11-5-2002; Amend. of 11-8-2005, §§ 2C, 10) 
Section 8. - Expenditures and accounting. 
(a)  No purchase shall be made by any department, board, commission or officer of the town other than the board of education and the probate court, except by the person's responsible for purchasing. Until such time as the office of comptroller is established under the provisions of section 4, sub. 1 of chapter VI of this charter, the treasurer may be designated by the council to perform some or all of the comptroller's responsibilities described in this section of the charter. The comptroller shall record the amount of authorized purchases and contracts for future purchases as encumbrances against the appropriation from which they are to be paid. 
(b)  No voucher, claim or charge against the town shall be paid until the same has been audited by the comptroller or his agent and approved by him for correctness and validity. Checks shall be drawn by the comptroller for the payment of approved claims which shall be valid only when countersigned by the treasurer. In the absence or inability to act of either the comptroller or treasurer with respect to the above duty, the mayor may be authorized to substitute temporarily for either but not both of them. 
(c)  The comptroller shall prescribe the time at which and the manner in which persons receiving money on account of the town shall pay the same to the town treasury. 
(d)  The several departments, commissions, officers and boards of the town shall not involve the town in any obligation to spend money for any purpose in excess of the amount appropriated therefor until the matter has been approved in accordance with the procedure outlined in section 3c and each order drawn upon the treasurer shall state the department, commission, board or officer and the appropriation against which it is to be charged. 
(e)  Appropriation for construction or for other permanent improvements, from whatever source derived, shall not lapse until the purpose for which the appropriation was made shall have been accomplished or abandoned, provided any such project shall be deemed to have been abandoned if three (3) fiscal years shall elapse without any expenditure from or encumbrance of the appropriations therefor. Any portion of an annual appropriation remaining unexpended and unencumbered at the close of the budget year shall lapse. 
(f)  Every payment made in violation of the provisions of this charter shall be deemed illegal and every official authorizing or making such payment or taking part therein and every person receiving such payment or any part thereof shall be jointly and severally liable to the town for the full amount so paid or received. If any officer or employee of the town shall knowingly incur any obligations or shall authorize or make any expenditure in violation of the provisions of this charter or take part therein, such action shall be cause for his removal. 
(Amend. of 11-5-2002) 
Section 9a. - Borrowing. 
    To avoid financial difficulties caused by nonpayment of current taxes the council shall authorize the mayor, by resolution, to borrow money in anticipation of collection of said taxes.

    The town shall have the power to incurr indebtedness by issuing its bonds or notes as provided by the General Statutes subject to the limitations thereof and the provisions of this section. The issuance of bonds and notes, other than notes issued in anticipation of taxes, shall be authorized by resolution of the council adopted after public hearing called and held in the manner set forth in section 5(c) of chapter III. Such resolution shall require prior Board of Finance recommendation. No such resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds or notes in excess of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00), in any fiscal year shall become effective until approved by referendum vote of electors and qualified taxpayers. Such referendum may be taken at any regular or special election or may be taken at a special meeting of the aforesaid electors of the Town of Plymouth, provided that the town council, by a majority vote at a legally authorized meeting approves such a special meeting of the electors. 
(Amend. of 11-5-2002; Amend. of 11-8-2005, §§ 1B, 2C, 3A) 
Section 10. - Contributions. 
    The town shall make no contributions to any organization or private corporation unless so authorized by general statute. No such contribution of more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) shall be made to any such organization or corporation unless the town is represented on its board by one or more members nominated thereto by the council. 
(Amend. of 11-5-2002) 
Section 11. - Annual audit. 
    The board of finance shall annually designate an independent public accountant or firm of independent public accounts to audit the books and accounts of the town in accordance with the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut.

Section 1. - Transfer of powers. 
    The powers which are conferred and the duties which are imposed upon any commission, board, department or office under the General Statutes or any ordinance or regulation, in force at the time this charter shall take effect, if such commission, board, department or office is abolished by this charter, shall be thereafter exercised and discharged by the commission, board, department or office upon which are imposed corresponding or like functions, powers and duties under the provisions of this charter. All commissions, boards, departments or offices abolished by this charter, whether elective or appointive shall continue in the performance of their duties until provision shall have been made for the discontinuance of such commissions, boards, departments or offices and the performance of their duties by other commissions, boards, departments or offices created under this charter and until the town clerk shall have notified the members of such commissions, boards, departments or offices as are abolished by this charter that their successors have qualified. All appointive powers now or hereafter conferred by the General Statutes upon boards of selectmen shall be exercised by council unless otherwise specifically provided in this charter.

Section 2. - Present employees to retain positions. 
    All persons holding permanent positions in the service of the town on the effective date of this charter, whose positions are included in the classified service by the terms of this charter, shall immediately become members of the classified service and retain such positions until promoted, transferred, reduced in rank, or removed in accordance with the provisions of this charter. All other employees of the town on the effective date of this charter, whose positions are not abolished by the provisions of this charter, shall retain such positions pending action by the council or the appropriate officer charged by this charter with powers of appointment and removal. Any provisions of law in force at the time this charter shall take effect, and not inconsistent with the provisions of this charter, in relation to personnel, appointment, ranks, grades, tenure of office, promotions, removal, pension and retirement rights, civil rights or any other rights or privileges of employees of the town or any office, department or agency thereof, shall continue in effect, until or unless amended or repealed in accordance with the provisions of this charter. 
Section 3. - Public right to know, procedures and ethics. 
    Sub. 1. Right to know. The public's right to know shall be guaranteed in accordance with the principles embodied in sections 1-19, 1-20, and 1-21 of the Connecticut General Statutes. This right shall be further assured by the provisions of this section of the charter. A deliberate violation or denial of the public right shall be considered cause for dismissal or recall proceedings in accordance with section 3, chapter V, of this charter and section 7, chapter II of this charter. 
    Sub. 2. Meeting procedures. All meetings of all Plymouth town government boards, agencies, commissions, committees, or subcommittees shall be open to the public with the exception of a duly authorized executive session, properly called and conducted under the provisions of the Statutes referenced in the foregoing section. All meetings, and minutes of meetings shall be conducted and recorded in accordance with established rules of parliamentary procedure and shall include 'Public Comment' as an agenda item. The town council shall also include "Public Comment on Non-Agenda Items" as an agenda item which may be combined with the "Public Comment" agenda item. Each board or commission as well as the town council may adopt a rule which limits the amount of time a speaker may speak during the Public Comment agenda item or in the case of the town council, the Public Comment on Non-Agenda items. Boards, commissions and the town council may use their own by-laws, rules or regulations pertaining to the allowance of Public Comment on agenda items. As a minimum, the minutes of all meetings, including those of executive sessions, shall include the date and time called, membership attendance, motions made and seconded, the identity of speakers and submitters of resolutions and/or motions, and a brief summary of subjects discussed. Notices of all meetings shall be properly publicized, and such notes shall meet the requirements of the applicable Connecticut General Statutes, Plymouth town ordinances, and rules established by individual boards, agencies, commissions, committees or sub-committees. All boards and commissions must set their own by-laws which shall include all annual organizational meetings with elections of officers and shall adopt rules and regulations, which it deems necessary to operate fairly and effectively. Such adopted rules and regulations shall be filed with the office of the town clerk. 
    Sub. 3. Public ethics. Plymouth government officials shall conduct themselves in a responsible and honorable manner, with first priority assigned to their public duties. Faithful meeting attendance and constructive involvement shall be expected, with objective evaluation of said performance to be duly noted by respective agency chairpersons. Said chairperson, inherently responsible for agency leadership, shall be responsible for reporting to the mayor and/or town council any serious or chronic infractions of public trust by any members of this agency. 
    Sub. 4. Conflict of interest. Any elected or appointed officer or any employee of the town who has a substantial financial interest, direct or indirect, in any contract, transaction or decision of any board or commission, shall record such disclosure upon the official record of their meetings. Violation by any such officer or employee of provisions of this section shall be grounds for his removal. Violation of this section with the knowledge, express or implied, of any person or corporation participating in such contract, transaction or decision shall render the same voidable by the council or by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
    Sub. 5. Board of ethics. The town council may enact local legislation that authorizes the establishment of a Town of Plymouth board of ethics and a fair and reasonable code of ethics. The code of ethics shall delineate the legal and operational parameters and standards of ethical governmental conduct and behavior. Until such a board of ethics and code of ethics have been established, complaints from any person of any alleged violation of the public ethics or conflict of interest provisions of subsections 3 and 4 of this section shall be forwarded to the office of the town clerk. This complaint must then be forwarded to the mayor for inclusion in the agenda for the next regular council meeting with written notification forwarded to the named individual(s) by certified mail, return receipt requested. If the town council cannot resolve the complaint, or if the complaint is against any member(s) of the council, the council shall appoint an ad hoc board of ethics to resolve the particular allegation(s). The board shall be an investigatory board of the town council and shall adopt rules and regulations which it deems necessary to operate fairly and effectively. Such adopted rules and regulations shall be filed with the office of the town clerk. When the investigation is completed, the board shall file its decision with the town council, to include the opinions of all members, both assenting and dissenting. The town council, with all members present, shall vote, with the majority rule prevailing, on the approval or disapproval of the board's decision. If disciplinary action is required in connection with the results of the board's investigation on the alleged violation, the town council shall take such action which is within its power as outlined elsewhere in this charter. Due process proceedings must be afforded such individual(s) for any complaints and actions related to this section.

ARTICLE IV. - PROPERTY MAINTENANCE AND CODE ENFORCEMENT[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- An amendment adopted Jan. 4, 2011, deleted the former Art. IV, §§ 7-60-7-67, and enacted a new Art. IV as set out herein. The former Art. IV pertained to blight abatement and derived from an ordinance adopted Sept. 7, 1999. 

Sec. 7-60. - Declaration of policy. 
    It is found and declared that there exist within the Town of Plymouth (town) properties with residential and nonresidential structures that are substandard with respect to structural integrity or maintenance. It is further found that certain conditions causing these structures to be substandard adversely affect the economic well being of the town and are harmful to the health, safety and welfare of town residents. These conditions include, but are not limited to the following: structural deterioration, lack of maintenance, infestation, fire hazards, accumulating refuse on private property, storage of two (2) or more unregistered vehicles, including campers providing such vehicles are on the assessor's tax list, and unsanitary conditions. It is further found that certain of these substandard structures can be repaired, rehabilitated, reconstructed or reused so as to provide decent, safe and sanitary housing and commercial facilities, thereby eliminating, remedying, and preventing the adverse conditions described above. It is further found that the lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration of certain structures create blight and initiate slums, and that if the same are not curtailed and removed, these undesirable conditions will grow and spread, necessitating future expenditures of large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate. 
    Declaration of purpose. The purpose of this article is to protect the public, health, safety, and welfare as follows:

Secs. 9-65-9-70. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VI. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES 

Sec. 9-71. - Declaration of policy. 
    The town council finds: 
(1)  The operation of sexually oriented businesses in the town requires special regulation and supervision by the town to protect, preserve and promote the health, safety and welfare of the patrons of such businesses, as well as the health, safety and welfare of the town's residents. Further, protecting order and morality, preserving the character and preventing the deterioration of the town's neighborhoods, promoting retail trade, maintaining property values, and ensuring sanitary and safe public places are desirable objectives of the community and its leaders. 
(2)  Statistics and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and towns in the United States indicate that: 
a.  Large numbers of persons, primarily male, frequent such sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms for the private viewing of so-called "adult" motion pictures, video tapes or live entertainment; 
b.  Such closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms have been used by patrons, clients or customers of such sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in specified sexual activities; 
c.  Male and female prostitutes have been known to frequent such businesses in order to provide sex for hire to the patrons, clients or customers of such businesses within such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms; 
d.  Doors, curtains, blinds and other closures installed in or on the entrances and exits of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms which are closed while such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms are in use encourage patrons using such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms to engage in specified sexual activities therein with prostitutes, other persons or by themselves, thereby promoting and encouraging prostitution and the commission of specified sexual activities which cause blood, semen, urine or other bodily secretion to be deposited on the floors and walls of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms, which deposits could prove detrimental to the health and safety of other persons who may come in contact with such deposits; 
e.  Booths, cubicles, studios and rooms that are closed while they are in use often contain certain holes that have been cut or smashed out of the walls or other partitioning material. These holes permit the inhabitant of one booth, cubicle, studio or room to engage in specified sexual activities with the inhabitant of the adjoining booth, cubicle, studio or room. These holes promote and encourage specified sexual acts to occur between persons anonymously. Anonymous sexual contact poses a higher risk of spread of communicable diseases, including the AIDS virus, Hepatitis B and other sexually transmitted diseases. Further, the existence of such holes in booths, cubicles, studios and rooms at sexually oriented businesses provides an increased risk that blood, semen, urine or other bodily secretions will be deposited on the floors and walls of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms, which deposits could prove detrimental to the health and safety of other persons who may come into contact with such deposits; 
f.  Specified sexual activities often occur at unregulated sexually oriented businesses that provide live adult entertainment. Specified sexual activities include sexual physical contact between employees and patrons of sexually oriented businesses and specifically include "lap dancing" or manual or oral touching or fondling of specified anatomical areas, whether clothed or unclothed. Such casual sexual physical contact between strangers may result in the transmission of communicable diseases, which would be detrimental to the health of the patrons and employees of such sexually oriented businesses; 
g.  The unregulated operation of sexually oriented businesses is associated with an increase in the incidence of sex-related crimes and other crimes and also has a disruptive effect on the surrounding neighborhood by causing excessive noise, parking problems, the presence of discarded sexually oriented material on residential lawns, and the performance of sexual acts in public places, as well as causing a deleterious effect on surrounding businesses; 
h.  Sexually oriented businesses that operate in close proximity to each other further contribute to an increase in crime, lower property values, blight and the downgrading of the quality of life in the adjacent area, and sexually oriented businesses that operate within a short distance of schools, churches, parks, libraries and other public facilities negatively impact such places and have an adverse effect upon persons, particularly children, walking to and from such places; 
i.  The reasonable regulation and supervision of such sexually oriented businesses tends to discourage prostitution, other sex-related crimes, anonymous and high-risk sexual contact and unsanitary sexual activity, excessive noise and property devaluement, thereby decreasing the incidences of communicable diseases and sex-related crimes, all thereby promoting and protecting the health, safety and welfare of the employees and the members of the public who patronize such businesses and protecting the health, safety and property interests of a town and its residents; and 
j.  Location and zoning regulations alone do not adequately protect the public health, safety and welfare and thus certain requirements with respect to the ownership, employees, facility, operation, advertising, hours of business and other aspects of the sexually oriented businesses are in the public interest. 
(3)  The continued unregulated operation of such sexually oriented businesses is and would be detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the town. 
(4)  The constitution and laws of the State of Connecticut grant to the town powers, especially police power, to enact reasonable legislation and measures to regulate and supervise sexually oriented businesses in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
(5)  It is the purpose and intent of the town council, in enacting this article, to regulate sexually oriented businesses to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the town and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations of such businesses in order to reduce or eliminate the adverse secondary effects of such sexually oriented businesses, protect residents from increased crime, preserve the quality of life, preserve the property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and businesses, deter the spread of blight, and protect against the threat to public health from the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
(6)  It is not the intent of the town council, in enacting this article, to deny to any person rights to speech protected by the United States or state constitutions, nor is it the intent of the council to impose any additional limitations or restrictions on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented films, video-tapes, books or other materials. Further, by enacting this article, the council does not intend to dent or restrict the constitutionally protected rights of any adult to obtain or view any sexually oriented materials under the United States or state constitutions, nor does it intend to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of such sexually oriented materials may have to sell, distribute or exhibit such materials.

Editor's note- Ord. No. PLY-90-1, adopted Nov. 13, 1990, amended Ch. 14 by adding provisions designated as §§ 14-5-14-9. In order to provide for better classification and in order to facilitate indexing, reference and use, the editor, with the consent of the town, has redesignated these provisions as Art. IV, §§ 14-64-14-68. The original numbering of these provisions has been preserved in the history notes at the end of each section and in the Code Comparative Table at the back of this volume as an aid in tracking. 

Sec. 14-64. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to promote public safety and convenience by providing a street numbering system to better assure the identification of addresses with the ease and speed essential to a quick response of emergency services.

Sec. 14-65. - Assignment of street numbers. 
(a)  The office of the assessor shall assign street numbers to all buildings and lots along any street or highway within the town, whether public or private. Such assignment of numbers shall not be construed as acceptance of such street or highway or any portion thereof. The office of assessor may change any assigned number if necessary or convenient to the provision of any orderly numbering system. Whenever the office of the assessor has assigned a street number to a property, the office of the assessor shall promptly notify by mail the owners of the property affected. The office of the assessor shall maintain maps showing the street numbers assigned to each property and such maps and records shall be open for public inspection. 
(b)  The office of the assessor shall assign numbers substantially in conformity with the following standards: 
(1)  Numbers shall be assigned at intervals of fifty (50) feet along the centerline of streets. In existing high-density areas where forty (40) feet or smaller lots exist, this principal may be modified to fit the situation. 
(2)  Even numbers will be assigned on the right and odd numbers on the left. 
(3)  Low numbers will begin at major streets. Through streets running northerly and southerly shall be numbered beginning at Main Street (Route 6). Through streets running easterly and westerly shall be numbered beginning at the easternmost terminus, as near as practical. 
(4)  On loop streets, the numbers shall increase in a counter clockwise direction. 
(5)  Main street (Route 6) shall be numbered consecutively from east to west with the low numbers beginning at the Bristol townline. 
(c)  On existing streets within developed areas the assessor may recommend to the town council, and the council may adopt, modifications of the standards set forth in subsection (b) in order to more readily conform the assigned street numbers to those presently in use.

a.  Next to or on front of door; or 
b.  On fascias above door areas at end of roof trusses; or 
c.  In the case of obstruction in the door area, or fascia, on mailbox or post at end of driveway. 
(5)  Numbers a minimum of four (4) inches in height shall be displayed on all residential buildings, including mobile homes, and all tenant spaces, front and back, on any multiple-unit complex. 
(6)  Numbers six (6) inches in height shall be displayed on all commercial buildings and upon the outside of any multiple-unit residential complex in areas on the front and rear so that the complex address itself can be readily identified by emergency response personnel. 
(7)  Curbside mailboxes shall also be marked with numbers in addition to those required on the residence, apartment or tenant space with Arabic numerals as follows: 
a.  Freestanding mailboxes shall be labelled with numbers of at least three (3) inches in height on both sides.

c.  Apartment mailboxes, or "drop" boxes, located within a lobby, foyer or some other location within the complex are exempt from required marking except as may be required by the Postal Department. 
d.  Multiple-unit dwelling or commercial complexes shall affix a floor plan in the vicinity of the lobby, foyer or entrance indicating the addresses of apartments or units in any building of a multiple building or "multi-winged" complex so that emergency personnel can readily identify the location of each unit. Each interior apartment shall be labeled with numbers a minimum of three (3) inches in height. 
(Ord. No. PLY-90-1, § 14-7, 11-13-90)

Sec. 16-25. - Investigation of nonconforming facilities; procedures for correction. 
    If the manager of the sewer authority shall have reason to believe that a sewer, drain, or any part or appurtenance thereof, which is connected to or discharges into any public sewer or drain of the sewer authority has been constructed, repaired or altered or is or has been used, operated or maintained, or that substances are being or recently have been discharged through the same in violation of the requirements of this regulation or of the standards established under its provisions, the manager shall inquire into the matter. The manager may require that the owner, lessee or tenant of the property where such sewer, etc., may be located or of property served by such sewer, etc., assist the manager and his representatives in such inquiry and permit them to examine such sewer, etc., and observe the manner in which such sewer, etc., is used, operated or maintained and the wastes discharged through the same. If the manager shall find on such inquiry that there exists good reason to believe that the requirements of this article have not been or are not being complied with, he may require that the owner, lessee or tenant of such property furnish the manager with adequate proof that the requirements are being conformed to and will continue to be complied with. If it shall appear that the requirements have not been or are not being conformed to or complied with or that good reason exists to believe that they may not thereafter be conformed to or complied with, the manager may order and require that such owner, lessee or tenant shall immediately take such measures, provide and install such appurtenances or make such changes in such sewer, etc., or the manner of using and maintaining the same as will ensure that the requirements will be conformed to or complied with thereafter. All assistance, proof, changes and new appurtenances required by this section to be furnished or provided by the owner, lessee or tenant of property in question shall be promptly furnished by such owner, lessee or tenant without expense to the sewer authority.

ARTICLE 1
PREAMBLE, ENACTING CLAUSE, ZONING DISTRICTS, ZONING MAP, AND SCOPE OF CONTROLS
A. PREAMBLE
These zoning regulations are designed to further the purposes set forth in Chapter 124,
section 8-2 of the Connecticut General Statutes, particularly in the following ways: to
regulate the height, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures, the
percentage of the area of the lot that may be occupied, the size of yards, courts and other
open spaces, the density of the population and the location and use of buildings, structures
and land for trade, industry, residence and other purposes; and the height, size and location of advertising signs and billboards within the limits of said town; to divide said town into
districts of such number, shape and area as may be best suited to carry out the purposes of
such act; to regulate the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration or use of buildings or structures and the use of land in accordance with a comprehensive plan designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to promote
health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding
of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; and to facilitate the adequate provision
for transportation, water, sewers, schools, parks and other public requirements, and with full consideration for the protection of historic factors and may provide that proper provision be
made for sedimentation control, and the control of erosion caused by wind or water; and with
a view of conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout said town, all in accordance with a comprehensive plan. Such regulations may
also encourage energy efficient patterns of land development, the use of solar and other
renewable forms of energy, and energy conservation.
All references to the Connecticut General Statutes refer to the revision of 1958, as amended.
B. ENACTING CLAUSE, SHORT TITLE
The Plymouth Planning & Zoning Commission, acting under authority of Chapter 124 of the Connecticut General Statutes, hereby adopts and enacts these regulations as the Zoning
Regulations of the Town of Plymouth.
2
C. ESTABLISHMENTS OF DISTRICTS
The Town of Plymouth is hereby divided into the following districts, the respective symbol
for each type of district set forth opposite its title:
SYMBOL TITLE________________________
R-20 Residence R-20 District
R-40 Residence R-40 District
R-LAKE Residence R-LAKE District
C-1 General Commercial District
RBZ Restricted Business District
C-VILLAGE Village District
I-1 Industrial I-1 District
I-2 Industrial I-2 District
Each district may be designated on the Zoning Map referred to in the Use and Bulk
Tables in Article 4, and elsewhere in the text of these regulations by its symbol only.
D. PURPOSE OF ZONING DISTRICTS
The following statements of intent outline the broad purpose of each zone and its relationship
to the adopted Plan of Conservation and Development. Additionally these statements are
intended to articulate the hierarchal character of the districts and their legislative purpose.
1. R-20 District  are those portions of Plymouth characterized by 20,000 sq. ft. parcels, or less, by the availability of both public water and public sewer, generally surrounding the historic center of Terryville and by those areas more suitable for a fuller range of housing opportunities and choice. Shown as high density residential on the future land use plan.
2. R-40 District  are those portions of Plymouth where generally the lack of either public water or public sewer requires minimum 40,000 sq. ft. parcels. Shown as either low or medium density residential on the future land use plan.
3. R-LAKE District  shown as high density on the future land use plan, the regulations for
these two specific areas are designed to provide for the most rational and orderly
development in areas bordering the lakes. Further, the purpose is to protect existing and proposed development around the lakes from siltation and pollution.
4. C-1 District  shown as commercial on the future land use plan, these districts are designed to allow general commercial and office development in areas on or near major streets, most notably Route 6, while restricting strip development.
5. RBZ District  while also shown as commercial on the future land use map, this district serves as a transitional zone for uses permitted along Route 6. It is intended for areas which contain a mix of low density homes by allowing some offices and personal services.
3
6. C-VILLAGE  is that area along Route 6 in the original Terryville settlement which is set apart to encourage revitalization and compatible land uses; promote and preserve the prevailing historic architectural context; promote the principles of New Urbanism and Smart Growth; and
promote development that is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Plan of Conservation and Development and the Economic Needs Study and the Market Research Analysis.
7. I-1 District  these districts are set apart by virtue of their past industrial use, their existence in industrial areas which no longer meet modern industrial standards and their potential continued use for less expensive often multi-storied facilities.
8. I-2 District  these districts are intended to provide suitable locations for heavy industrial
uses, manufacturing and distribution and to include areas either in or suitable for designed industrial parks.
E. ZONING MAP
The areas and boundaries of such districts are hereby established (a) as shown on a
map entitled Zoning Map of the Town of Plymouth and (b) as specified in the
following sections. Such map bearing the same date as these regulations, referred to herein as the Zoning Map, together with everything shown thereon, is hereby made part of the regulations. An original of the Zoning Map and any amendments thereof shall be maintained on public display in the office of the Town Clerk.
1. Interpretation Of District Boundaries On Zoning Map: The following rules
shall apply to determining the location of district boundaries:
i. Along Rights-Of-Way. Where a district boundary is shown following a
street, a public right-of-way or a railroad, the boundary is respectively the
center line of such street, or public right-of-way, or a line located midway
between the main tracks of said railroad, and such boundary shall be deemed
to be changed automatically whenever the center line of such street, or
public right-of-way is changed or said main railroad tracks are changed, if
the new center line is no further from the old center line than 50 feet at any
point.
ii. Map Dimensions. Where a dimension is indicated on the Zoning Map such dimension shall control. However, in the absence of a specific dimension
being indicated on the Zoning Map, the dimension shall be determined by using the map scale.
iii. Physical Markers. Where a street, highway, railroad or other physical
monument or marker on the ground by which a boundary is determined
varies from that as shown on the Zoning map, the on-the-ground physical monument or marker shall control.
iv. Lots Divided by District Boundary. If any lot is divided by a district
boundary, the part of such lot within each district shall be regulated by all
4
the Bulk Regulations of that district, except that the maximum floor area and maximum number of dwellings shall be equal to the sum of the floor areas and dwelling units respectively permitted on each part of the lot.
F. SCOPE OF CONTROLS
1. Compliance with Regulations: Except as otherwise provided herein, no land,
building or structure or part thereof shall be constructed, reconstructed,
erected, extended, enlarged, moved, arranged,, altered or used, or the use
changed, or the dimensional requirements of lots, yards or courts changed,
except in conformity with the requirements of these regulations for the district
in which such land, building, structure or use is located.
2. Permitted and Prohibited Uses: Any use not specifically permitted by right or
by Special Permit in a zoning district by these Regulations shall be deemed to be prohibited within such district.
3. Determination of Uses: Where a proposed use is not clearly permitted nor
clearly prohibited in a zoning district by these regulations, the Commission
shall make the determination as to whether the proposed use is permitted in
that district by right or by Special Permit, or is prohibited.
4. Minimum Requirements: In interpreting and applying these regulations, the requirements contained herein are declared to be the minimum requirements necessary.

D. GENERAL PROVISIONS
1. Corner Lots: On a corner lot each line which abuts a street shall be deemed to be a front lot line, and the required yard along both lot frontages shall be a required front yard. The owner shall erect, and so designate on the plot plan, which of the remaining two required yards shall be the required side yard and the required rear yard.
2. Visibility at Intersections: On no such lot shall any wall, structure, planting or obstruction to vision be erected, maintained, placed or planted which unreasonably or dangerously obstructs or interferes with the visibility of drivers of vehicles on a curve, driveway or street intersection. The minimum vision clearance shall require that no wall, fence, structure, or planting exceed a height of two feet above the street grade (except for street trees or other high-branching trees) within the triangular area formed by the intersection of street lines and a straight line connecting those points on said street lines which are thirty-five (35) feet distant from the point of intersection.
In order to protect public health and safety, any owner of a lot not in conformance with the requirements of this section may be ordered by the Zoning Enforcement Officer to remove dangerous obstructions to visibility. Such order shall be compiled with within thirty (30) days of its issue.
21
3. Undersized Lots: Undersized lots existing prior to January 6, 1961. Lots which contain less area or frontage than is required by these regulations may be used for detached single family residences provided the following standards are met:
a) The lot is under separate ownership from adjoining tracts or lots.

d) Other bulk and yard requirements shall be as specified in the TABLE OF GENERAL BULK REGULATIONS.
e) The Health District shall certify in writing to the Zoning Enforcement Officer that the lots can be served in a safe and adequate manner relative to water supply and a sewage disposal system prior to the issuance of either zoning or building permits.
Within the R-LAKE zone, lots subject to the provisions of this section must be combined with any adjacent land under the same ownership to form a lot which will meet, or if insufficient land is commonly owned, which will more closely approximate, the frontage and area requirements of the R-LAKE zone.
4. Rear Lots: The provisions of this section are intended to allow by special permit the use of land which has been unintentionally landlocked or deprived of minimum lot frontage on an accepted street, or in the case of a subdivision on an approved street, where topography or the unusual shape of the property lends itself to the use of a rear lot to accomplish the best use of the land. The Commission may authorize the issuance of a zoning permit with or without conditions for the construction of an allowed use and accessory facilities on a rear lot upon special permit application if it finds that the public health and welfare will not be substantially adversely affected and if it finds that such a lot provides for the best development of the land taking into consideration difficult drainage, difficult configuration, inaccessibility, temporary flooding, steep topography, utility lines, traffic safety and right-of-access. A special permit shall not be required when a proposed rear lot is part of a subdivision otherwise meeting the requirements of the Plymouth Subdivision Regulations.
The following standards shall apply to rear lots under this section:
22
a) Rear lots in the R-20 zone shall have a minimum buildable lot area of 40,000 square feet, not including the accessway. Rear lots in the R-40 zone shall have a minimum buildable lot area of 60,000 square feet, not including the accessway.
b) All yard requirements for rear lots either in the R-20 or R-40 zone shall meet the yard requirements of the R-40 zone.
c) For each rear lot there shall be provided an accessway for the use of such lot to an accepted street. The right of access shall not be less than 30 feet in width, except, in the case of a rear lot of sufficient area to permit subsequent division into more than one lot, the right of access shall not be less than 50 feet in width. However, the width of adjoining accessways may be reduced to a minimum of 25 feet each
d) provided that a common driveway is approved by the commission as set forth in Paragraph (vi) below which driveway shall serve multiple lots. Each lot shall have
access to it which is adequate to permit the unobstructed passage of fire and other emergency equipment.
e) The right of access required in iii above may be in fee simple ownership or may meet the requirements for a right of access through a written recorded easement.
f) Accessways of one hundred (100) feet or more in width, but less than the required frontage for the zone in which such parcel is located may be used for the siting of a primary residential structure at the discretion of the Commission. Such width shall be maintained from the street line to the minimum buildable lot area as defined in i above.
g) The application for rear lot approval shall be accompanied by a site plan conforming to the requirements of Article 7, Section A and showing the right of access, and by location map at a distance of 1,000 feet from the property lines of such rear lot; of sufficient detail to permit the Commission to determine whether the right of access ought to be extended across the lot in order to provide a connection to other streets or rights of access, or to the logical extension of such streets in the event of subdivision of such adjoining property. Rear lot configurations which impede the extension of a safe and efficient road system or which prevent the implementation of road extensions recommended in the Plan of Conservation and Development may not be approved except at the discretion of the Commission.
h) In order to provide adequate access for emergency vehicles, rear lot drives in excess of 150 feet shall meet one of the following criteria; a travel way of 12 feet wide provided with a maximum of six (6) inches of bank run gravel and two (2) inches of processed gravel on a firm road bed; or eight (8) inches of bank run gravel on a firm
road bed; or eight (8) inches of bank run gravel on a firm road bed. The maximum grade shall not exceed 15%. Where a proposed drive is in excess of 250 feet, it shall comply with the design requirements of one of the following diagrams on the preceding page.
i) Each rear lot shall be served by its own driveway except as otherwise approved by the Commission. In making its decision to allow for a common driveway the
23
Commission shall consider the topography, soils and vegetation of the site, as well as existing development and projected development in the immediate area. In the event that the Commission approves the use of a common driveway to be used by more than one lot the application for rear lot approval shall be accompanied by appropriate documentation to reflect the rights and responsibilities of each of the lot owners relative to the common driveway. Common driveways for rear lots may include driveway access to conforming lots as approved by the Commission.
ix. No accessway, either singularly or in combination with other acessways/driveways
pursuant to subsection vii above, shall exceed 600 feet from a public road.
5. Reduction of Lot Area: No lot area shall be so reduced or so created that the minimum area, width and other dimensions of the lot or any of the yards or open spaces shall be smaller than prescribed by these regulations.
E. NON-CONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES, AND LOTS
This section applies only to those uses in existence on the effective date of these regulations. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section and Article 5, Section C (Flood Damage Prevention Regulations), the lawful use of any premises existing on the effective date of these regulations may be continued although neither such use nor the bulk of the same conforms to the regulations. The effective date of these regulations as referred to in this article shall also include the effective date of any subsequent amendment to these regulations which may cause any use to become non-conforming subject to the regulations therein.
1. Non-conforming Uses: Where a lawful use exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these Regulations as adopted or amended, such use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
i. Any non-conforming use may either be changed to another non-conforming use, providing the degree of non-conformity is not intensified in any way, or changed to any conforming use.
ii. No non-conforming use shall, if once changed into a conforming use, be changed back again into a non-conforming use.
iii. Any voluntary discontinuance of a non-conforming use accompanied by an intent not to re-establish that use shall be presumed to be a permanent discontinuance.
iv. Normal maintenance and repair of and incidental alteration in a building occupied by a non-conforming use is permitted.
v. A non-conforming use shall not be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these regulations, unless such move has been approved by the Commission.
vi. No residential non-conforming use may be added to or enlarged unless such additions or enlargements conform to the applicable provisions of these regulations and is
24
approved by the Commission. Such additions and enlargements shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of either: the original ground floor area of the building; or, the land use area at the time a permit is applied for.
vii. No commercial or industrial non-conforming use may be added to or enlarged unless such additions or enlargements conform to the applicable provisions of these
regulations and are approved by the Commission. Such additions and enlargements shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of either: the original ground floor area of the building; or, the land use area at the time a permit is applied for.
2. Non-conforming Structures: Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of these regulations which could not be built under the
provisions of these regulations as enacted or amended by reason of restrictions on floor area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
i. Such non-conforming structure shall not be enlarged or altered in a manner which extends or increases the non-conformity but may be altered to decrease the non-conformity.
ii. Normal maintenance and repair, structural alteration, and moving, reconstruction, or enlargement of a structure with non-conforming bulk is permitted provided such change does not exceed any present non-conformity with regard to yard and height requirements.
iii. Any non-conforming building or structure which is destroyed or damaged by fire or casualty may be reconstructed and structurally altered provided the degree of non-conformity is not increased. In such cases, a building permit shall be received within one (1) year and the building substantially completed within two (2) years of the damage or destruction.
iv. In substantially built up areas a side yard may be reduced with the approval of the Planning & Zoning Commission for the enlargement of a house or the erection of a garage. However, in no case shall the side yard be reduced to less than six feet and sufficient width shall be left on the other side for the unobstructed passage of emergency equipment to reach the rear of the building.
3. Nonconforming Lots:
i. Any lot which does not conform to minimum area and frontage requirements for the current zone in which it is located shall be designated a nonconforming lot, providing such lot shall have been recorded by deed or shall have been shown on a map filed in the Town Clerks office prior to the effective date of these regulations.
ii. Only one single family dwelling and accessory buildings may be erected on a nonconforming lot located in a residential zone, except as stated below, provided all other requirements of the height and area schedule are complied with. The area or
25
frontage of a nonconforming lot shall not be reduced except as allowed under Article 3, Section D.4 of these regulations.
iii. Where a nonconforming lot located within a residential zone presently contains or contained subsequent to the effective date of these regulations a use, structure or building which is currently or previously accessory to a principal use, structure or
building located on a contiguous parcel of land, such lots for the purpose of this regulation are deemed to be merged and therefore no zoning permit or building permit shall be issued for the construction of a single family dwelling on such nonconforming lot.
F. DRIVEWAY CUTS WITHIN THE ROUTE 6 CORRIDOR. For
properties zoned C, RBZ, C-VILLAGE or Industrial which have frontage on and draw access from either Route 6 or Route 72 South of Route 6, no site plan shall be approved which would require a cut in the curb line of either Route 6 or Route 72 South of Route 6, which did not exist prior to the effective date of these regulations, unless such new cut would replace an existing driveway, or would provide an entrance and/or exit servicing more than one parcel of land, or would provide access to a plot of land which had existed as a lot of record prior to the effective date of these regulations, but for which no curb cut had previously existed.
G. DEVELOPMENT IN AN R-LAKE DISTRICT
1. General: The R-Lake Districts contained in these Zoning Regulations are established in order to provide for the most rational and orderly development in areas bordering the lakes. The Regulations herein adopted are hereby found and declared to be appropriate to Plymouth and designed to protect existing and proposed development around the lakes and the lakes from siltation and pollution.

26
2. Consolidation of Lots: Where two (2) or more undersized adjoining lots of record are in the same ownership and located within the R-LAKE Zone on the effective date of this subsection, then such lots shall be combined to meet all the lot area and frontage requirements of the Regulations. All properties of record owned prior to the adoption of this subsection (10/15/94) as amended will be exempted from the requirements of this subsection provided:
i. The owner of such properties, on or subsequent to the effective date of this subsection, can prove to the satisfaction of the Commission, that development of each individual lot or several lots combined will not adversely or materially affect the availability, quality and quantity of the existing fresh water supply of each and every one of the adjoining owned and/or non-owned properties, as will be determined by an independent, impartial and licensed professional water testing service, or a similar procedure commonly used in such cases, deemed acceptable to the Commission;
ii. All adjoining property owners of record situated within the same lake district, neighborhood or jurisdiction, will be afforded reasonable opportunity to testify and show cause on behalf of any proposed development and present alternatives or recommend remedial actions, if any, as may be appropriate to preserve and assure the continuity and integrity of the existing fresh water supply resources of their respective properties;
iii. At the option of the Commission and under its direction, a water resources impact, feasibility, or similar type of study may be required, with inputs solicited from, and in cooperation with, the designated respective lake association representatives and other affected residents and interested parties, to continue to adequately safeguard the communitys water supply resources and alleviate any concerns expressed by the general public. The cost of any such study required by the Commission will be the responsibility of the applicant, or in the case of an abutter or abutters, the petitioner(s); and
iv. Commission approval under these Regulations, as amended will not become effective until all monies due the Town of Plymouth as a result of any proceedings subject to these Regulations are paid in full.

Notes to Table of General Bulk Regulations
1. Height Limitations may be modified by the Commission in the case of utilities, radio transmitters or civil defense installations.
2. In an Industrial District, no lot shall be used unless it has a frontage of at least 100 feet on a street or has a right of way 50 feet in width to a street, said right of way having been approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, as being of suitable location and grade.
3. All required front yard depths in substantially built up areas may be altered with the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission to the existing set back of neighboring properties. In the case of dead end streets in residential areas, the minimum lot frontage at the end of such street may be reduced with the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission without however in any way affecting the other requirements stipulated in the Use Regulations and Bulk Use Regulations tables.

B. SOIL & EROSION CONTROL REGULATIONS
1. Preamble: These Regulations are designed to further the purpose set forth in Public Act 83-388 entitled An Act Concerning Soil Erosion and Sediment Control as it may apply to activities subject to Sections 8-2 and 8-25 of the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut, to strengthen and extend the soil erosion and sediment control activity in the
35
Town and to reduce the danger from storm water runoff, minimize sediment pollution from land being developed and to conserve and protect the land, water, air and other environmental resources of the Town.
The Commission, acting under the authority of Public Act 83-388 of the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut, hereby adopts and enacts these Regulations as the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Regulations for Land Development of the Town of Plymouth, Connecticut. All references to the Connecticut General Statutes refer to the Revision of 1958, as amended.
No land development which is cumulatively more than one-half acre in area may be undertaken in any district unless certification therefore in compliance with the provisions of these Regulations has first been obtained from the Commission or its appointed agent.
2. Activities Requiring a Certified Erosion and Sediment Control Plan: A soil erosion and sediment control plan shall be submitted with any application for development when the disturbed area of such development is cumulatively more than one-half acre.
3. Exemptions: A single family dwelling that is not part of a subdivision of land shall be exempt from these soil erosion and sediment control Regulations.
4. Erosion and Sediment Control Plan: To be eligible for certification, a soil erosion and sediment control plan shall contain proper provisions to adequately control accelerated erosion and sedimentation and reduce the damages from storm water runoff on the proposed site based on the best available technology. For methods and practices necessary for certification refer to the Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control (2002), as amended, published by the Connecticut Council on Soil and Water Conservation. Alternative principles, methods and practices may be used with prior approval of the Commission.
Said plan shall contain, but not be limited to:
i. A narrative describing:
a. The development;
b. The schedule for grading and construction activities including:
1) Start and completion dates;
2) Sequence of grading and construction activities;

The Commission on its own or after referral to its appointed agent shall determine the amount of bond to be posted.
Site development shall not begin unless the soil erosion and sediment control plan is certified and those control measures and facilities in the plan scheduled for installation prior to site development are installed and functional and a completion bond therefore has been posted in a form and in an amount acceptable and approved by the Commission.
Planned soil erosion and sediment control measures and facilities shall be installed as scheduled according to the certified plan.
8. Inspection and Release of Bond: Inspections shall be made by the Commission or its designated agent during the development to ensure compliance with the certified plan and that control measures and facilities are properly performed or installed and maintained. The Commission may require the permittee to verify through progress reports that soil erosion and sediment control measures and facilities have been performed or installed and maintained. The Commission may require the permittee to verify through progress reports that soil erosion and sediment control measures and facilities have been performed or installed according to the certified plan and are being operated and maintained.
Upon completion of all work specified in the certified plan, the applicant shall notify the Commission thereof and submit a report, including maps as necessary, certifying that the soil erosion and sediment control measures have been completed as approved or as may have been modified with the prior approval by the Commission. Upon receipt of the report and inspection of the site by the Commission or its designated agent, the Commission may release any bond posted upon the finding that the provisions of the certified plan have been complied with.
C. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION REGULATIONS
1. Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact, Purpose and Objectives: Statutory authorization. The legislature of the State of Connecticut has in Section 8-2 of the General Statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Plymouth does hereby promulgate the following:
i. The flood hazard areas of the Town of Plymouth are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
38
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
ii. It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize the public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
a. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increase in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
b. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
c. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
d. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage, and;
e. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
iii. The objectives of these Regulations are:
a. To protect human life and health;
b. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
c. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
d. To minimize business interruptions;
e. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
f. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and,
g. To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
39
2. General Provisions: These Regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood
hazard within the jurisdiction of the Town of Plymouth.
i. Such areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its report entitled Flood Insurance Study, Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Town of Plymouth dated November 6, 1998, with accompanying floodway maps and other supporting data, and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be part of these Regulations;
ii. A zoning permit or subdivision plan approval shall be required in compliance with the provisions of the Zoning Regulations and/or Subdivision Regulations (including these Flood Damage Prevention Regulations) prior to commencement of any development activities;
iii. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and other applicable Regulations;
iv. These Regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where these Regulations and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail;
v. In the interpretation and application of these Regulations, all provisions shall be:
a) considered as minimum requirements;
b) liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and;
c) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes;
vi. The degree of flood protection required by these Regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These Regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These Regulations shall not create liability on the part of the Town or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on these Regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made there under.
3. Administration: Designation of the Flood Plain Prevention Administrator.
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall administer and implement the Flood
Damage Prevention Regulations.

43
6. Standards for Stream without Established Base Flood Elevations and/or Flooding: Obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, including data developed pursuant to these Regulations, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in Zone A on the Towns FIRM meet the standards of these regulations.
When utilizing data other than that provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the following standard applies: Select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principal that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point.
7. Standards for Areas with Established Elevations: In all areas of flood hazard A1-30, AE, AH where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in Section 2 or 4, the following provisions are required:
i. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least to one (1) foot above the level of the base flood elevation;
ii. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure located in Zone A-1-30, AE & AH shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least to one (1) foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
iii. Non-residential structures located in all A-Zones may be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that together with all attendant utilities and sanitary facilities the areas of the structure below the required elevation are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection;
iv. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
a. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria;
1) Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
44
2) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade, and;
3) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of flood waters in both directions;
b. Electrical, plumbing, and other utility connections are prohibited below the base flood elevations;
c. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator);
v. Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 2 are areas designated as floodways on the Towns Flood Boundary and Floodway Map. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply;
a. Prohibit encroachment, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any (0.00) increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge;
b. In A-Zones where base flood elevations have been determined, but before a floodway is designated, require that no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development (including fill) be permitted which would increase base flood elevations more than one (1) foot at any point along the water-course when all anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed development.
8. Standards for Subdivision Proposals: In all special flood hazard areas, the following requirements shall apply:
i. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
ii. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
iii. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards, and;
iv. In Zone A base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals.
45
9. Variance Procedures: The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the Town shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of these Regulations.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Commission in the enforcement or administration of these Regulations.
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals or any person owning land which abuts or is within one hundred feet (100) of the land in question may appeal within fifteen (15) days after such decision to the Superior Court as provided in Section 8-8 of the General Statutes.
i. Specific situation variances  the following general standards shall apply to the granting of variances:
a. Buildings on a Historic Register. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section, provided the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration will not result in the structure losing its historical character;
b. Existing, small lot location. Variance MAY be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level;
c. Floodway prohibition. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
ii. Considerations for granting of variances. In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other Sections of these Regulations, and:
a. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
b. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
c. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
d. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
e. The necessity of the facility to waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility;
f. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the purposed use;
g. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
h. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
46
i. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
j. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters;
k. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of these regulations, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these Regulations.
iii. Conditions for variances shall comply with the following:
a. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief, and in the instance of a historical building, the determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building;
b. Variances shall only be issued upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;
c. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
d. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
iv. Violation of the provisions of these Regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations shall be subject to a fine as provided for by the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut and shall pay all costs and reasonable legal fees involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Town from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
47
D. AQUIFER/WATERSHED PROTECTION REGULATIONS
1. Statutory Authorization; Statement of Purpose: Major sources of Plymouths and Bristols drinking water lie in the northeastern quadrant of the community. A series of
wells operated by the Connecticut Water Company draw from a large stratified drift underlying much of Terryville. The City of Bristol Water Department maintains several surface reservoirs within the Departments extensive landholdings in Plymouth. The separate watersheds areas have been identified. Protection of these resources is vital to ensure adequate supply of safe drinking water. This protection can be best achieved by regulations that control pollution within those areas as authorized by Sec. 22a-354a through 22a-354bb of the Connecticut General Statutes.
2. Area Designation: The Aquifer/Watershed Protection Areas shall be superimposed on existing use districts. The provisions for these areas shall be in addition to all other requirements of the existing use districts. In the event of conflict between any provision of this ordinance and any other regulation, the more restrictive requirement shall apply.
The Aquifer/Watershed Protection Areas shall coincide with those sections of town identified as: the Connecticut Water Company Aquifer Protection Area as mapped by the Central Connecticut Regional Planning Agency; and, the City of Bristol Department Watershed Area as mapped by the Maguire Group.
Where the bounds of this District are in doubt or dispute, the burden of proof shall be on the owners of the land in question to show where they should be located. Such proof shall be in the form of a map, prepared by a professional engineer and land surveyor, at a scale of 1 inch to forty feet, with two foot contours, showing the existing district boundary and that proposed.
3. Permitted Uses: All uses which are permitted in the existing zones are also permitted in the Aquifer/Watershed Protection Areas except as follows.

The Planning & Zoning Commission has determined: that there exists a need within the Town of Plymouth to provide for needed and desired housing opportunities for older persons; together with related facilities and services especially designed to meet the physical and social needs of older persons; that private programs can be implemented to satisfy such need; and, that authority for permitting such development exists pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes, Section 8-2 and 42 U.S.C. Section 3607. Therefore, the purpose of this section is to: promote well planned innovative developments which become aesthetically pleasing senior residential environments; to ensure an adequate supply of affordable housing for older persons in Plymouth, especially multi-family attached, two-family attached, and single-family detached residences; to provide for a greater variety of housing for Plymouths residents; and to foster small developments which can be nestled into neighborhoods with minimal impact on surrounding properties.
2. Upon application of the owner of the land or his duly authorized agent, the Commission may, in appropriate cases and subject to conditions necessary to protect the public health, safety, convenience and property values grant a special permit for a Senior Residence Development (SRD) of multi-family attached, two-family attached, or single-family detached senior residences in the R-20 and R-40 districts subject to and upon the following conditions:
i. All such applications shall conform to the requirements of Section 4.B. (Table of General Use Regulations) and of Section 4.C. (Table of General Use Regulations), except as modified in the SRD regulations.
ii. The SRD tract shall, upon approval, be either a common interest community in compliance with Chapter 828 of the Connecticut General Statutes (Common Interest Ownership Act) or held as a single parcel by one or more entities for the purpose of providing rental apartments. In addition to all other data required by this section, the applicant shall provide at the time of the public hearing the common interest community declaration deed restrictions or restrictive covenants, and a
proposed management and implementation plan assuring that the units set aside as affordable will be made available to those tenants or owners meeting the relevant income criteria. Such documents shall provide for the private processing, monitoring, and certification of tenant or owners meeting the relevant income criteria. Such documents shall provide for the private processing, monitoring, and certification of tenant or owner selection for the affordable units. A proposed contract with a social services agency may be utilized to meet the plan requirements of this section. Such documents shall not include provisions for public management or certification of tenant or owner selection, but shall authorize the Town of Plymouth to enjoin or set aside transfers or leases which do not preserve the units as affordable housing as described in Connecticut General Statutes, Section 8-30g(a) and to recover its actual expenses; including attorney fees, or any such action. Such documents shall also provide for the establishment and continuation of facilities of services as required under 42 U.S.C. Section 3607 and related regulations.
78
iii. The SRD shall meet the requirements of an affordable housing development, as defined in Connecticut General Statutes, Section 8-30g(a).
iv. The only uses permitted by an SRD special permit shall be multi-family attached senior residences, two-family attached senior residences, and single-family residences, as well as accessory uses (e.g., garages, community rooms) which are integral to the senior residence development.
v. The SRD tract shall be a minimum of 10 acres in size at time of application, however as part of a common interest community the tract may be subdivided into lots conforming to the underlying zone, i.e., not less than 20,000 square feet in the R-20 District, and not less than 40,000 square feet in the R-40 District.
vi. The SRD shall not abut another SRD or other affordable housing development as defined in Connecticut General Statutes, Section 8-30g(a), as amended. The Commission may require a minimum separation distance of up to but (not exceeding 1,000 feet) between the nearest points of respective property lines of the proposed SRD and any existing SRD or other affordable housing development, as measure on a straight line, if the Commission finds that without such separation the proposed SRD will cause an unreasonably high level of traffic on all residential streets on which all such developments are located, taking into account data and information, both existing and projected, of average daily vehicle trips, peak hour traffic, adequacy of rights of way and travel ways, existing roadway and intersection capacity, health and public safety and traffic lights and other traffic control devices, on such street or streets. Within the R-40 District, all SRD dwelling units shall be within one mile of Route 6/Main Street and shall be within one mile of a firehouse.
vii. The SRD tract shall have a minimum of 125 feet of frontage on a public street in the R-20 District, and 250 feet of frontage on a public street in the R-40 District. Minimum yards (applicable to the parcel perimeter and individual lots) shall be 25 feet front and 50 feet rear yards, and 15 feet side yards. In the R-40 zone, the side yard shall be 25 feet. Yards are in addition to the required 25 feet landscaped buffer
(effective side setback 50' and effective rear setback 75 feet). Building separation shall be 30 feet. Side and rear yards shall not be applicable to individual lots within a SRD where such lots are under the same ownership and are to be developed in common with the remainder of the SRD.
viii. In the R-20 District, impervious coverage (excluding public streets) shall not exceed 50% of the overall tract. In the R-40 District, impervious coverage (excluding public streets) shall not exceed 35% of the overall tract.

a. sufficient evidence has been presented to the Commission to document that the reduced parking will be adequate to serve the development;
b. The site plan shows the location of the temporarily deferred parking spaces and notes that such spaces may be required to be installed in the future, when, in the sole judgment of the Commission, parking demands at the site require installation.
c. The property owner shall execute a caveat to be recorded on the land records that the owner, or the successor and assigns of the owner, will install as many of the deferred parking spaces as the Commission deems necessary within six (6) months of written notification from the Commission to do so.
xii. At least 10% of the site shall be set aside for active or passive recreational uses. Such uses may include but are not limited to garden areas, picnic areas, nature trails, or community buildings.
xiii. Utilities, streets, sidewalks and related improvements shall be provided and shall conform to Town standards. However, a 24 feet street pavement width may be provided if 1.25 parking spaces or more are constructed for every dwelling unit.
Other standards may be reduced or waived upon recommendation of the Town Engineer in order to reduce development costs provided that sufficient evidence has been presented to the Commission to document that the reduced construction will be adequate to serve the development and will not adversely impact public health or safety and to document that the reduction in development costs is required to develop units as affordable housing units.
xiv. A site plan shall be submitted with the SRD special permit application, portraying all information necessary to properly evaluate the application and conformity with the purpose and letter of these regulations.

xix. No zoning permit or building permit shall be issued for any dwelling unit in the SRD development unless the main utility lines (including power, sanitary sewer, and water) have been extended to the site of such dwelling unit, within the SRD development, and are approved for use. No zoning certificate of use and compliance shall be issued for any dwelling unit in any single phase of SRD development unless all site improvements, excluding building (but including any community or common buildings) have been completed to a stage of construction at which only final surfacing of any road or common driveway remains. In lieu of completion of such work or any part thereof, the Commission may accept a letter of credit, in an amount and with adequate security, surety or conditions satisfactory to its securing to the municipality the actual construction and installation of such improvements. Such security may be reduced by the Commission to reflect the value of completed and accepted work. The project and associated bonding shall be phased. Each phase shall function independently of succeeding phases. Phases shall be delimited on the site plan. Other than in the first phase, no certificate of occupancy and/or certificate of use and compliance shall be issued for any dwelling
unit, until all improvements in the prior phase(s) have been completed. A maintenance bond, i.e., letter of credit, equivalent to 10% of the value of the infrastructural improvements, shall be posted for a period of one year after completion of the site improvements and shall guarantee the improvements installed.
xx. Prior to the issuance of the first building permit, the applicant shall provide the Town with a digital version (GIS compatible) of the site plan portraying the proposed SRDs property lines, dwelling units, streets, sidewalks, utilities, and any community building.

N. OPEN SPACE SUBDIVISION
1. Purpose: The intent of this section is to provide alternatives to residential development permitted in the R-20 and R-40 districts if the Commission finds that the application and the accompanying maps and plans conform to the requirements of these regulations and that it will substantially accomplish the following purposes:
i. To conserve and preserve land to assure that its development will best maintain or enhance the appearance, character, natural beauty and historic interest of an area;
ii. To preserve land for park and recreational purposes, for neighborhood amenities, and for the potential for the siting of community renewable energy systems;
iii. To conserve forest, wildlife, agricultural, water supplies, and irreplaceable natural features located in the tract such as, but not limited to watercourses, significant stands of trees, individual trees of significant size, and rock outcroppings;
iv. To encourage controlled flexibility of design and development in such a way as to promote the most appropriate use of land, considering its particular size and topography, to protect natural drainage systems, scenic vistas, streams, ridge lines, rivers, ponds, wetlands, floodplains, and to properly manage for stormwater and runoff and erosion and sedimentation control;
v. To promote the preservation of space that will benefit the present and future generations of Plymouth including active or passive recreation areas (including hiking trails), farmland of local significance, and/or areas containing significant natural features such as unusual terrain or land forms, vegetation, and wildlife habitats.
vi. To provide for the efficient use of land by providing more flexible road and lot layout resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets and thereby lowering housing, public maintenance, and energy costs;
vii. To provide design and development of a large tract or tracts of land in a manner which have street patterns, building orientations, landscaping, and south-facing slopes that maximize solar energy collection and space heating needs.
2. Special Permit: Upon application of the owner of land or his duly authorized agent, the Commission may, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, prescribed by it, grant a special permit for the open space subdivision of single-family detached residences in R-20 and R-40 districts subject to and upon the following conditions:
i. Number of Building Lots. The maximum number of building lots to be approved shall be computed by reducing the total gross acreage of the tract to exclude all factors defined as minimum buildable land in Article 4, Section A.2.
The total gross acreage shall further be reduced by ten percent (10%) for street rights-of-way and by ten percent (10%) for open space dedication.
82
The remaining area shall be divided by the minimum lot size requirement for the zoning district in which the open space subdivision is to be located.
The number of building lots derived may be increased by up to ten percent (10%) by the Commission based upon: the quantity and quality of open space design; consistency with the Plan of Conservation and Development; and, overall project design features including project specific architectural detailing of public/open spaces and roadways.

10.2 Criteria for Decision. In carrying out the purposes and policies of sections 22a-
36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the CGS, including matters relating to regulating,
licensing and enforcing of the provisions thereof, the Commission shall take into
consideration all relevant facts and circumstances, including but not limited to:
a. The environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or
watercourses.
b. The applicants purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to, the
proposed regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no
environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses.
c. The relationship between the short term and long term impacts of the
proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses and the
maintenance and enhancement of long term productivity of such wetlands or
watercourses.
d. Irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which
would be caused by the proposed regulated activity, including the extent to
which such activity would foreclose a future ability to protect. enhance or
restore such resources, and any mitigation measures which may be
considered as a condition of issuing a permit for such activity including, but
not limited to, measures to (1) prevent or minimize pollution or other
environmental damage, (2) maintain or enhance existing environmental
quality, or (3) in the following order of priority: restore, enhance and create
productive wetland or watercourse resources.
e. The character and degree of injury to, or interference with, safety, health, or
the reasonable use of property which is caused or threatened by the
proposed regulated activity.
f. Impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses
outside the area for which the activity is proposed and future activities
associated with or reasonably related to, the proposed regulated activity
which are made inevitable by the proposed regulated activity and which may
have an impact on wetlands or watercourses.
21
g. Measures which would mitigate the impact of any aspect of the proposed
regulated activity[ies]. Such measures include, but are not limited to, actions
which would avoid adverse impacts or lessen impacts to wetlands and
watercourses and which could be feasibly carried out by the applicant and
would protect the natural capacity of the wetlands or watercourses to support
fish and wildlife, prevent flooding, supply water, control sedimentation,
prevent erosion, assimilate wastes, facilitate drainage, and to provide
recreation and open space.
10.3 A permit shall not be issued for an application which received a public hearing
for a significant activity unless the Commission finds on the basis of the record
that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist. In making this finding the
Commission shall consider the facts and circumstances set forth in subsection
10.2 of this section. The finding and the reasons therefore shall be stated on
the record in writing.
10.4 In the case of an application which is denied on the basis of a finding that there
may be feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated activity
which have less adverse impact on wetlands or watercourses, the Commission
shall propose on the record in writing the types of alternatives which the
applicant may investigate provided this subsection shall not be construed to
shift the burden from the applicant to prove that he is entitled to the permit or to
present alternatives to the proposed regulated activity.
10.5 For purposes of this section, (1) wetlands and watercourses includes aquatic,
plant or animal life and habitats in wetlands or watercourses, and (2) habitats
means areas or environments in which an organism or biological population
normally lives or occurs.
10.6 A municipal inland wetlands commission shall not deny or condition an
application for a regulated activity in an area outside wetlands or watercourses
on the basis of an impact or effect on aquatic, plant or animal life unless such
activity will likely impact or affect the physical characteristics of such wetlands
or watercourses.
10.7 In reaching its decision on any application after a public hearing, the
Commission shall base its decision on the record of that hearing. Documentary
evidence or other material not in the hearing record shall not be considered by
the Commission in its decision. The Commission may seek advice from its
experts on information already in the hearing record, provided that no new
evidence or testimony is offered by these experts. If the Commission seeks the
technical advice of its experts, it should do so only after providing notice to the
applicant (and any other named parties to the proceeding) and providing an
opportunity to hear and/or rebut the comments or opinions of the Commission's
expert.
22
10.8 The Commission may deny a permit for any regulated activity on any building
lot or subdivision lot which does not have contiguous dry land in an amount
equal in size to the minimum building lot specified in the applicable Plymouth
zoning regulations. Said denial, if made, will be based on the criteria set forth
in Section 10.2 of these regulations.
10.9 There shall be no earth-moving, filling, or construction activity within 100 feet of
a watercourse or wetland boundary, unless the applicant can prove that there is
no prudent or feasible alternative.

conditions, limitations or modifications, the applicant may attempt to modify the
proposal to the Commission's satisfaction. The Commission shall determine
whether the proposed modification requires the filing of a new application. The
rejection of a modified or corrected application by the Commission shall be
equivalent to the denial of an application for purposes of appeal.
11.6 If the Commission denies a permit, the application shall not be resubmitted
unless the proposal is modified in a fashion that substantially changes the
impacts which resulted in the denial. Such submittal shall take the form of a

SECTION 12
ACTION BY DULY AUTHORIZED AGENT
12.1 The Commission may delegate to its duly authorized agent the authority to
approve or extend a permit for an activity that is not located in a wetland or
watercourse when such agent finds that the conduct of such activity would
result in no greater than a minimal impact on any wetlands or watercourses
provided such agent has completed the comprehensive training program
developed by the Commissioner of Environmental Protection pursuant to
section 22a-39 of the CGS. Requests for such approval shall be made on a
form provided by the Commission and shall contain the information listed under
Section 7.5 of these regulations and any other information the Commission may
reasonably require. Notwithstanding the provisions for receipt and processing
applications prescribed in Sections 8, 9 and 11 of these regulations, such agent
may approve or extend such an activity at any time.
SECTION 13
BONDS
13.1 Upon approval of the application and before a permit is issued, the applicant
may be required to file a bond with such surety in such amount and in a form
approved by the Commission. The form shall be a regular savings account (not
a surety, first mortgage, special or time account). The following individual's
names will appear on the account: the applicant, the Mayor of the Town of
Plymouth, and the Comptroller of the Town of Plymouth. The account shall be
releasable by a combination of any two of the three individuals named above.
The above conditions shall appear on the account.
13.2 The bond or surety shall be conditioned on compliance with all provisions of
these regulations and the terms, conditions and limitations established in the
permit including notification to the Commission of the start of regulated
activities (Section 11.10f). All erosion controls shall be maintained in a
functional condition and, upon completion of the regulated activity removed
once all disturbed areas have been stabilized. Any damage, sedimentation or
erosion resulting from a failure to maintain or properly install erosion controls
will result in issuance of a cease and desist and steps shall be taken to utilize
the bond to make necessary repairs.
26
Size of the bond shall be estimated by the applicant's engineer or, in the case
of applications which did not require an engineer, by the applicant, and shall not
exceed one hundred twenty five (125%) percent of the fair market estimate of
the possible repairs to bring the area back to order. The size of the bond is
subject to the approval of the Director of Public Works. The minimum bond
required shall be $100.00
13.3 On any construction site containing wetlands or watercourses, bond will not be
released or a certificate of occupancy issued, until the site has been inspected
by the Commission or the designated agent.
SECTION 14
ENFORCEMENT
14.1 The Commission may appoint an agent or agents to act in its behalf with the
authority to issue notices of violation or cease and desist orders and carry out
other actions or investigations necessary for the enforcement of these
regulations. In carrying out the purposes of this section, the Commission or its
duly authorized agent shall take into consideration the criteria for decision
under Section 10.2 of these regulations.
14.2 The Commission or its agent may make regular inspections, at reasonable
hours, of all regulated activities for which permits have been issued with the
consent of the property owner or the authorized agent of the owner during the
life of the permit.
14.3 In the case in which a permit has not been issued or a permit has expired, the
Commission or its agent may make regular inspections at reasonable hours
with the consent of the property owner or the authorized agent of the property
owner.
14.4 If the Commission or its authorized agent finds that a person is conducting or
maintaining any activity, facility or condition which is in violation of the Act or
these regulations, the Commission or its authorized agent may:
a. issue a written order by certified mail, return receipt requested, to such
person conducting such activity or maintaining such facility or condition to
immediately cease such activity or to correct such facility or condition.
Within ten (10) calendar days of the issuance of such order the Commission
shall hold a hearing to provide the person an opportunity to be heard and
show cause why the order should not remain in effect. The Commission
shall consider the facts presented at the hearing and within ten (10) days of
the completion of the hearing, notify the person by certified mail that the
original order remains in effect, that a revised order is in effect, or that the
order has been withdrawn. The Commission shall publish notice of its
27
decision in a newspaper having general circulation in Plymouth. The
original order shall be effective upon issuance and shall remain in effect
until the Commission affirms, revises or withdraws the order. The issuance
of an order pursuant to this section shall not delay or bar an action pursuant
to Section 22a-44(b) of the CGS, as amended;
b. issue a notice of violation to such person conducting such activity or
maintaining such facility or condition, stating the nature of the violation, the
jurisdiction of the Commission, and prescribing the necessary action and
steps to correct the violation including, without limitation, halting work in
wetlands or watercourses. The Commission may request that the individual
appear at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission to
discuss the unauthorized activity, and/or provide a written reply to the notice
or file a proper application for the necessary permit. Failure to carry out the
action(s) directed in a notice of violation may result in issuance of the order
provided in Section 14.3 or other enforcement proceedings as provided by
law.
14.5 The Commission may suspend or revoke a permit if it finds that the permittee
has not complied with the terms, conditions or limitations set forth in the permit
or has exceeded the scope of the work as set forth in the application including
application plans. Prior to revoking or suspending any permit the Commission
shall issue notice to the permittee, personally or by certified mail, return receipt
requested, setting forth the facts or conduct which warrants the intended action.
The Commission shall hold a hearing to provide the permittee an opportunity to
show that it is in compliance with its permit and any and all requirements for
retention of the permit. The permittee shall be notified of the Commissions
decision to suspend, revoke, or maintain a permit by certified mail within fifteen
(15) days of the date of its decision. The Commission shall publish notice of
the suspension or revocation in a newspaper having general circulation in the
municipality.
