PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Tequesta, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code, as supplemented through September 27, 2001, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the village council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mary Wolcott Miles, Village Clerk, John "Skip" Randolph, Village Attorney and other members of the village staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

(a)  The special magistrate, upon notification by the code enforcement officer that an order has not been complied with by the set time or upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this division for each day the violation continues past the date set by the special magistrate for compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code enforcement officer.

Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the village to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the village for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If, after due notice and hearing, the special magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, he may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in subsection (b) of this section. 
(b)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation and shall not exceed $500.00 per day for a repeat violation, and, in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.

(a)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the special magistrate shall consider the gravity of the violation, any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation, and any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(b)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records in the office of the clerk of the circuit court in and for Palm Beach County, and, once recorded, shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists, and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of the state, including a levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed otherwise to be a judgment of a court, except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this division shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until a judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to section 2-189, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine pursuant to this section runs in favor of the village and the village may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this division.

In such circumstances, the village shall bill the property owner or his agent for all charges and expenses incurred, whether incurred by the utilization of village personnel and materials or other outside contractors retained by the village for these purposes. The securing of an outside contractor to perform these services shall be deemed to be the securing of emergency services and shall not require the village to utilize a competitive bid process to select a contractor. Should the bill for such services remain unpaid for a period of 30 days or more, the village may record a claim of lien encumbering the property and thereafter proceed according to law to enforce the lien. 
(h)  The enforcement procedures contained in this section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other enforcement procedures or remedies available to the village for the enforcement of this Code.

DIVISION 3. - SUPPLEMENTAL CRITERIA AND PROCEDURAL RULES 

Sec. 22-81. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Appropriate to surroundings refers to the appearance of a building relative to its surroundings, including into an orderly relationship with landscape and nature, other buildings and open areas. Building scale and composition, related to adjacent properties, is also important. Future surroundings must also be weighed. Advertising signs on buildings must be appropriate to the surroundings in the same way. 
    Honest design construction concerns proper design of all work in its details, the uses of weather resistant materials, etc. The term applies also to advertising. Poorly designed work must always be discouraged. 
    Proper design concepts refers to architectural planning and to the analysis of the whole structure in terms of forms and composition, color, materials, and surface decoration. It includes scale in relationship to adjacent buildings and landscape. It applies to interior character of the individual project. It applies in the same manner to alterations and advertising on the project (building). Proportion means the relation of the parts of a building to each other and to the whole of the building. Proportion is closely tied to the scale of a building. 
    Space means urban or external space, and is defined by the building and the others around it. All objects-bridges, fountains, groups of trees, walls, and in particular, the facades of buildings-are brought into play in the creation of urban space. 
(Ord. No. 11-13, § 1, 7-11-2013) 
Sec. 22-82. - General requirements relative to site plan review. 
    The planning and zoning board shall review, and recommend final action to the village council or take final action itself, pursuant to subsection 22-53(a) and (b). In making such review, the planning and zoning board shall apply the following general requirements: 
    The general requirements are minimum aesthetic standards for all site development, buildings, structures, or alterations within the village except in districts R-1A and R-1. It is required that site development, buildings or alterations, with the sole exception of districts R-1A and R-1, show proper design concept, express honest design construction and be appropriate to the surroundings. 
(1)  Harmony with other buildings. Buildings or structures which are a part of a present or future group or complex shall have a unity of character and design, and a relationship of forms, and the use, texture and color of materials shall be such as to create an harmonious whole. When the area involved forms an integral part of, is immediately adjacent to or otherwise clearly affects the future of any established section of the village, the design and location on the site shall enhance rather than detract from the character, value, and attractiveness of the surroundings. 
(2)  Harmony with surroundings. Buildings or structures located along strips of land or on single sites and not a part of a unified multibuilding complex shall strive to achieve visual harmony with the surroundings. If they are built in undeveloped areas, the three primary requirements shall be met: express honest design construction, show proper design concepts, and be appropriate to the village. 
(3)  Facades. All facades visible to public or adjacent property shall be designed to create a harmonious whole. Materials shall express their function clearly and not appear as a material foreign to the rest of the building. 
(4)  Methods of harmonious design. It is not to be inferred that buildings must look alike or be of the same style to be harmonious. Harmony can be achieved through the proper consideration of proportions, site planning, landscaping, materials and color. 
(5)  Advertisements on buildings. Buildings which are of symbolic design for reasons of advertising and are not compatible to the atmosphere of the village shall not be approved. Symbols attached to the buildings will not be allowed unless they are secondary in appearance to the building and landscape and are an aesthetic asset to the project and neighborhood. 
(6)  Exterior lighting. Exterior lighting may be used to illuminate a building and its grounds for safety purposes, but in an aesthetic manner. Lighting is not to be used as a form of advertising in a manner that is not compatible to the neighborhood or in a manner such that it draws considerably more attention to the building grounds at night than in the day. Lighting following the form of the building or part of the building will not be allowed. All fixtures used in exterior lighting are to be selected not only for functional value, but for aesthetic value. 
(7)  Inappropriate building styles. Buildings of a style or style type foreign to South Florida and/or its climate will not be allowed. It is also to be understood that buildings, even though they have a historical significance to South Florida, that do not conform to the existing or to the evolving atmosphere of the village will not be approved. 
(8)  Garish design. Building surfaces, walls and roofs that are considered garish by the board will be denied approval. 
(9)  Takeout and pickup windows. Takeout or pickup windows of retail or wholesale establishments shall not be located on a building facade that faces a public right-of-way, unless they are designed in such a manner as to be an aesthetic asset to the building and neighborhood. 
(10)  Exterior forms. All exterior forms, attached or not attached to buildings, shall be in conformity to and secondary to the building. They shall be an asset both to the aesthetics of the site and to the neighborhood. 
(11)  Telephones, vending machines, and facilities dispensing merchandise or services. All telephones on private property, vending machines, or any facility dispensing merchandise or a service shall be confined to a space built into the building or enclosed in a separate structure compatible with the main building. 
(12)  Advertisements on amenities. No advertising will be allowed on any exposed amenity or facility such as benches and trash containers. 
(13)  Use of symbolic colors; exterior storage and display of merchandise. The following are added criteria that pertain to but are not limited to gasoline stations. Symbolic colors of the exterior facades or roofs may not be used unless they are harmonious with the atmosphere of the neighborhood. For example, royal blue, which symbolizes a brand of gasoline and other establishments, would not be acceptable in most cases. Exterior display of goods for sale or those designating a service will not be allowed, except that a gasoline station's display of goods and tools of a service may be displayed on the pump island, provided that the island is not considered by the board to be enlarged to take advantage of this provision, and provided that the goods and tools be such that they can be used or installed at the island. For example, an oil rack is acceptable, but a tire display is not. Areas used to store materials such as mufflers, tires, packing crates or cases, refuse and garbage shall be screened from adjacent property and from the public view. 
(Ord. No. 11-13, § 1, 7-11-2013; Ord. No. 7-15, § 1, 6-11-2015) 
Sec. 22-83. - External space. 
    External space of the site should be designed relative to its neighborhood, adjacent properties, buildings, access (roads and pedestrian routes) and its activity. Building facades enclosing a space must be harmonious. Where, because of their use or age, like facades are not possible, consideration should be taken to unify the walls of the space by the application of landscaping, or manmade objects of like design, at modular spacing. The floor of an external space is of primary importance; its materials, texture and color, contour and shadow on it are to be considered, not only in relation to the external space, but to its setting. Natural vistas must be surveyed and planning steps are to be taken to preserve them to the greatest extent. Careful consideration as to future development shall be given to vistas which open into undeveloped areas. 
(Ord. No. 11-13, § 1, 7-11-2013) 
Sec. 22-84. - Landscaping. 
    Landscape plans will be evaluated regarding their relationship to the existing natural landscape, the existing and proposed developed landscape, including those on adjacent properties and street rights-of-way, and the existing and proposed buildings. 
(1)  Preservation of existing natural landscape. The existing natural landscape character should be preserved whenever possible. For example, an area containing a stand of trees should be preserved by the developer to the greatest extent possible and should be further landscaped in a complementary manner, rather than destroy the existing trees and replant with a type of vegetation completely foreign to the immediate natural environment. 
(2)  Paving, benches and similar fixtures. Landscaping includes not only trees and plantings, but paving, benches, fountains, exterior lighting fixtures, fences, and any other item of exterior furniture. All items of the landscape are to be selected not only for their functional value but for their aesthetic value, and must complement the whole. Placement of any such items within the village's right-of-way is prohibited. 
(3)  Screening. One of the basic uses of landscaping will be to screen a particular objectionable area, an accessory use or an otherwise acceptable structure or space. The achievement of this is left to the designer, whether by walls, fences, mounds of earth, or vegetation. Screening shall be employed to mask from the public view or adjacent properties such service areas as trash and garbage areas, outside equipment of an unaesthetic character, and accessory buildings or areas not enhancing or in keeping with the aesthetics of the project or neighborhood. 
(4)  View from other areas. Landscaping shall be designed in such a manner as to impart its aesthetic character when viewed from any area accessible to the public or from adjacent properties. This is to include views from high-rise buildings and bridges. 
(5)  Installation; size of plants. All landscaping and plantings designated on the plans approved by the board shall become effective and/or attain the size or height indicated within one year from the date of the certificate of occupancy of the project. 
(6)  Florida friendly landscaping. All landscaping shall comply with the "Florida Friendly" requirements set forth in chapter 78, article IX, division 4. 
(Ord. No. 11-13, § 1, 7-11-2013) 
Sec. 22-85. - Parking lots. 
(a)  General standards. Parking lots are to be designed as an aesthetic asset to a neighborhood and to the building, group of buildings, or facility the parking lot serves. A parking lot is to be considered an external space, a transitional space which is experienced between the access (such as roads) and the building, group of buildings or other outside spaces which it serves. The responsibility toward beautification and design of the parking lot is the same as that which the homeowner has to his residential lot. The parking lot, because it is viewed from above as well as at eye level, should be designed accordingly. 
(b)  Screening. Parking lots and their parked automobiles are to be effectively screened from the public view and from adjacent property in a manner that is attractive and compatible with safety, the neighborhood, and facilities served. 
(c)  Landscaping. Parking lot landscaping shall comply with the requirements of chapter 78, article IX, division 4. Trees are of primary importance in the landscape. They are not to be minimized in height or in quantity. The tree imparts, especially in a relatively flat area, a sense of three-dimensional space, it casts shadows that reduce the monotony of the expanse of paving, and it creates a refuge from the tropical sun. Signs designating entrances, exits, regulations, etc., in excess of two square feet are to be of a tasteful design. The pavement is to be more than wall-to-wall asphalt. It is recommended that pavement be varied in texture or color designating lanes for automobile traffic, pedestrian walks and parking spaces. Bright colored pavement is to be used only with restraint. In order to create a pleasant atmosphere it is recommended that consideration also be given to sculpture, fountains, gardens, pools and benches. Design emphasis is to be given to the entrances and exits to and from the lot. Trash, refuse and unaesthetic storage and mechanical equipment must be screened from view in accordance with village requirements. 
(d)  Lighting. Lighting is to be designed not only from a standpoint of safety and vandalism, but for visual effect. Low lights of a human scale can be used along with feature lighting emphasizing plants, trees, barriers, entrances, exits, etc. The fixtures are to be selected not only for their functional value but for their aesthetic value.

In addition to posting, the law enforcement officer shall make a reasonable effort to ascertain the name and address of the owner. If such is reasonably available to the officer, he shall mail a copy of such notice to the owner on or before the date of posting. If the property is a motor vehicle as defined in F.S. § 320.01(1) or a vessel as defined in F.S. § 327.02, the law enforcement agency shall contact the state department of highway safety and motor vehicles in order to determine the name and address of the owner and any person who has filed a lien on the vehicle or vessel as provided in F.S. § 319.27(2) or (3) or F.S. § 328.15(1). On receipt of this information, the law enforcement agency shall mail a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner and to the lienholder, if any. If, at the end of five days after posting the notice and mailing such notice, if required, the owner or any person interested in the lost or abandoned article described has not removed the article from public property or shown reasonable cause for failure to do so, the following shall apply: 
(1)  For abandoned property, the law enforcement agency may retain any or all of the property for its own use or for use by the state or unit of local government, trade such property to another unit of local government or state agency, donate the property to a charitable organization, sell the property, or notify the appropriate refuse removal service. 
(2)  For lost property, the officer shall take custody and the agency shall retain custody of the property for 90 days. The agency shall publish notice of the intended disposition of the property, as provided in this section, during the first 45 days of this time period. 
a.  If the agency elects to retain the property for use by the unit of government, donate the property to a charitable organization, surrender such property to the finder, sell the property, or trade the property to another unit of local government or state agency. Notice of such election shall be given by an advertisement published once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county if the value of the property is more than $100.00. If the value of the property is $100.00 or less, notice shall be given by posting a description of the property at the law enforcement agency where the property was turned in. The notice must be posted for not less than two consecutive weeks in a public place designated by the law enforcement agency. The notice must describe the property in a manner reasonably adequate to permit the rightful owner of the property to claim it. 
b.  If the agency elects to sell the property, it must do so at public sale by competitive bidding. Notice of the time and place of the sale shall be given by an advertisement of the sale published once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. The notice shall include a statement that the sale shall be subject to any and all liens. The sale must be held at the nearest suitable place to that where the lost or abandoned property is held or stored. The advertisement must include a description of the goods and the time and place of the sale. The sale may take place no earlier than ten days after the final publication. If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the county, the advertisement shall be posted at the door of the courthouse and at three other public places in the county at least ten days prior to sale. Notice of the agency's intended disposition shall describe the property in a manner reasonably adequate to permit the rightful owner of the property to identify it. 
(c)  If the property is sold at public sale pursuant to subsection (b)(2)b. of this section, the agency shall deduct from the proceeds the costs of transportation, storage, and publication of notice, and any balance of proceeds shall be deposited into an interest-bearing account not later than 30 days after the date of the sale and held there for one year. The agency shall provide a bill of sale clearly stating that the sale is subject to any and all liens. The rightful owner of the property may claim the balance of the proceeds within one year from the date of this stated deposit by making application to the agency. If no rightful owner comes forward with a claim to the property within the designated year, the balance of the proceeds shall be deposited in the general fund. 
(d)  The owner of any abandoned or lost property who, after notice as provided in this section, does not remove such property within the specified period shall be liable to the law enforcement agency for all costs of removal, storage, and destruction of such property, less any salvage value obtained by disposal of the property. Upon final disposition of the property, the law enforcement officer shall notify the owner, if known, of the amount owed. In the case of an abandoned boat or motor vehicle, any person who neglects or refuses to pay such amount is not entitled to be issued a certificate of registration for such boat or motor vehicle, or any other boat or motor vehicle, until such costs have been paid. The law enforcement officer shall supply the state department of highway safety and motor vehicles with a list of persons whose boat registration privileges or whose motor vehicle privileges have been revoked under this subsection. Neither the department nor any other person acting as agent thereof shall issue a certificate of registration to a person whose boat or motor vehicle registration privileges have been revoked, as provided by this subsection, until such costs have been paid. 
(e)  Whoever opposes, obstructs, or resists any law enforcement officer or any person authorized by the law enforcement officer in the discharge of his duties as provided in this section, upon conviction, is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in F.S. § 775.082 or 775.083. 
(f)  Any law enforcement officer or any person authorized by the law enforcement officer is immune from prosecution, civil or criminal, for reasonable, good faith trespass upon real property while in the discharge of duties imposed by this section. 
(g)  The rightful owner shall be liable for the law enforcement agency's costs for transportation and storage of lost or abandoned property and the agency's cost for publication of notice of disposition of lost property. If the rightful owner does not pay such costs within 30 days of making claim to the property, title to the property shall vest in the law enforcement agency.

    Emergency work means work made necessary to restore property to a safe condition following a public calamity or work required to protect persons or property from an imminent exposure to danger. 
    Microbar is a unit of pressure commonly used in acoustics and is equal to one dyne per square centimeter. 
    Period of a periodic quantity means the smallest increment of time for which the function repeats itself. 
    Periodic quantity means an oscillating quantity, the values of which recur for equal increments. 
    Sound level meter means an instrument including a microphone, an amplifier, an output meter, and frequency weighting networks for the measurement of noise and sound levels in a specified manner. 
    Sound pressure level, in decibels of sound, is 20 times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of this sound to the reference pressure, which reference pressure must be explicitly stated.

(1)  All applications for development orders shall ensure that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service in the village. 
(2)  An application for a development permit shall ensure that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service if there exists no development order under which the permit is sought, and no development order is required prior to the issuance of the permit, e.g., a residence on a parcel of unplatted land. 
(3)  The final determination regarding concurrency is at the issuance of the development order. If no development order is required, the latest point to determine concurrency is the first development permit on a site. 
(b)  Exception. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the prescribed levels of service may be degraded during the actual construction of new facilities, if upon completion of the new facilities the prescribed levels of service will be met. 
(Ord. No. 18-13, § 1, 8-8-2013) 
Sec. 62-123. - Determination of available capacity. 
    For purposes of this division, the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by: 
(1)  Adding together: 
a.  The total capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service; and 
b.  The total capacity of new facilities, if any, that will become available on or before the date of occupancy of the development. The capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one or more of the following is shown: 
1.  Construction of the new facilities is underway at the time of issuance of the development order. 
2.  The new facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of the facilities or the provision of services at the time of issuance of the development order. 
3.  The new facilities are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, or an agreement or development order pursuant to F.S. ch. 380. Such facilities shall be consistent with the capital improvements element of the village comprehensive plan. The agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities and services will be in place when the impacts of the development occur. 
(2)  Subtracting from that number the sum of: 
a.  The demand for the service or facility created by existing development as documented in the village comprehensive plan; and 
b.  The demand for the service or facility created by the anticipated completion of other approved developments, redevelopment, or other development activity. 
(Ord. No. 18-13, § 1, 8-8-2013) 
Sec. 62-124. - Action upon failure to show available capacity. 
    Where available capacity cannot be shown, the following methods may be used to maintain adopted levels of service: 
(1)  The owner or developer may provide the necessary improvements to maintain levels of service. In such case, the application shall include appropriate plans for improvements, documentation that such improvements are designed to provide the capacity necessary to achieve or maintain the levels of service, and recordable instruments guaranteeing the construction, consistent with calculations of capacity set forth in section 62-123(1) and (2). 
(2)  The proposed development may be altered such that the projected levels of service are no less than the adopted levels of service. 
(Ord. No. 18-13, § 1, 8-8-2013) 
Sec. 62-125. - Burden of showing compliance to be on developer. 
    The burden of showing compliance with level of service requirements shall be upon the developer. In order to be approved, applications for development approval shall provide sufficient information showing compliance with these standards.

Sec. 62-126. - Reserved. 
Sec. 62-127. - Vested rights. 
    A development order or right may be determined to be vested pursuant to an administrative procedure established by the village council based on the owner's or applicant's demonstration through presentation of competent, substantial evidence that he acted in good faith and in reasonable reliance upon some act or omission of the village and has made a substantial change in position and has incurred extensive obligations or expenses based upon that act or omission. A land use designation in a prior comprehensive plan, or a zoning designation, is not sufficient to constitute an act or omission of the village. The treatment of similar cases by state courts, as reviewed by the village attorney, as well as recommendations of staff, shall be relevant to the determination of the extent vested rights are established, if any. A vested rights determination pursuant to F.S. ch. 163 shall be deemed to be an action taken on a development order and shall be subject to challenge in the manner provided in F.S. § 163.3215.

(Ord. No. 11-19, § 1, 5-9-2019) 
Sec. 63-26. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is: 
(a)  To establish a competitively neutral policy for the use of the village's public rights-of-way by all communications services providers, including wireless service providers, as well as communications facilities providers, wireless infrastructure providers, and pass-through providers, for the placement and maintenance of communications facilities, including wireless communications facilities, and the provision of communications services, including wireless communications services and other utilities, including but not limited to, those defined in F.S. § 337.401, as same may be amended from time to time; and

(Ord. No. 11-19, § 1, 5-9-2019) 
Sec. 63-27. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Abandonment or abandoned means 180 or more consecutive days with the absence of any active communications service providers, including wireless service providers, on a communications facility, including a wireless communications facility. Abandoned communications facilities shall be removed or cured as required by this article. This term shall not include cessation of all use of a communications facility within a physical structure where the physical structure continues to be used for some purpose or use accessory to the communications facility. For example, cessation of all use of a cable within a conduit, where the conduit continues to be used as referenced above, shall not be "Abandonment" of a communications facility. Notwithstanding the foregoing example, if the communications facility is attached to an existing structure that has an independent function, such as a utility pole or the like, said abandonment of the communications facility requires removal of the communications facility only and does not require the removal of the existing structure. The term shall also exclude the temporary cessation of the provision of communications services where the provider intends to re-establish the provision of communications services in the future. For example, cable drops to homes that are deactivated based on competitive alternatives but are maintained for when the customer re-activates service shall not be "Abandonment" of a communications facility. The temporary cessation with intent to re-activate must be documented to the satisfaction of the village. 
    ADA means the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101, et seq., as same may be amended from time to time and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
    Antenna means communications equipment that transmits or receives electromagnetic radio frequency signals used in providing wireless service. 
    Applicable codes means uniform building, fire, electrical, plumbing or mechanical codes adopted by a recognized national code organization, or local amendments to those codes enacted solely to address threats of destruction of property or injury to persons, or local codes or ordinances adopted to implement the Florida Advanced Wireless Infrastructure Deployment Act as set forth at F.S. § 337.401(7), as same may be amended from time to time. The term includes objective design standards that may require a new utility pole that replaces an existing utility pole to be of substantially similar design, material, and color of that may require reasonable spacing requirements concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment. The term includes objective design standards adopted by ordinance that may require a small wireless facility to meet reasonable location context, color, stealth, and concealment requirements; however, such design standards may be waived by the village upon a showing that the design standards are not reasonably compatible for the particular location of a small wireless facility or that the design standards impose an excessive expense. The waiver shall be granted or denied within 45 days after the date of the request. 
    Arterial road means a roadway route providing service which is relatively continuous and of relatively high traffic volume, long average trip length, high operating speed, and high mobility importance, and constitutes the largest proportion of total travel. In addition, every United States numbered highway is an arterial roadway. 
    Authority utility pole means a utility pole owned by the village and located in the village's public right-of-way. The term does not include a village owned utility pole in a right-of-way located within a retirement community that: 
(a)  Is deed restricted as housing for older persons as defined in F.S. § 760.29(4)(b), as same may be amended from time to time; and 
(b)  Has more than 5,000 residents; and 
(c)  Has underground utilities for electric transmission or distribution.

(ii)  For an authority utility pole that does not support an aerial facility used to provide communications services or electric service, the village shall provide a good faith estimate for any make ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested co-location, including necessary pole replacement, within 60 days after receipt of a complete application. Make ready work, including any pole replacement, must be completed within 60 days after written acceptance of the good faith estimate by the applicant. Alternatively, the village may require the applicant seeking to co-locate a small wireless facility to provide a make ready estimate at the applicant's expense for the work necessary to support the small wireless facility, including pole replacement, and perform the make ready work. If pole replacement is required, the scope of the make ready estimate is limited to the design, fabrication, and installation of a utility pole that is substantially similar in color and composition. The village may not condition or restrict the manner in which the applicant obtains, develops, or provides the estimate or conducts the make ready work subject to usual construction restoration standards for work in the village's public right-of-way. The replaced or altered utility pole shall remain the property of the village. 
(iii)  The village may not require more make ready work than is required to meet applicable codes or industry standards. Fees for make ready work may not include costs related to pre-existing damage or prior non-compliance.

    The procedures and standards for the development and subdivision of real estate and for the surveying and platting thereof adopted and prescribed by this chapter are hereby found by the village to be necessary and appropriate in order to provide for economical and sufficient streets with adequate widths and with proper alignment and grades designed to promote the public safety, health and general welfare, to provide for suitable residential neighborhoods with adequate streets and utilities and appropriate building sites to save unnecessary expenditure of public funds by initial proper construction of streets and utilities and to provide proper land records for the convenience of the public and for better identification and permanent location of real estate boundaries. 
(Ord. No. 29-13, § 1, 10-10-2013) 
Sec. 66-2. - Jurisdiction. 
    From and after the date of adoption, the regulations in this chapter shall govern subdivisions of land within the village limits and subdivisions about to be annexed to the village, and no subdivider may proceed with improvement or sale of lots in a subdivision until such subdivision plat shall have been approved and accepted as provided in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 29-13, § 1, 10-10-2013) 
Sec. 66-3. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Building line means a line on a lot, generally, but not necessarily, parallel to a lot line or road right-of-way line, located a sufficient distance therefrom to provide the minimum yards required by chapter 78. The building line delimits the area in which buildings are permitted subject to all applicable provisions of chapter 78. 
    Cul-de-sac means a street having one open end and being permanently terminated by a vehicular turnaround. 
    Dedication means the deliberate appropriation of land by its owner for any general and public uses, reserving to himself no other right than such as are compatible with the full exercise and enjoyment of the public uses to which the property has been devoted. 
    Easement means a right-of-way granted for limited uses of private property for a public or quasipublic purpose. 
    Lot means a tract or parcel of land identified as a single unit in a subdivision and intended for transfer of ownership, use or improvement. 
    Lot split means the subdivision of a single lot or parcel of land into two lots or parcels. 
    Right-of-way means land reserved, used or to be used for a street, alley, walkway, drainage facility or other public purpose. 
    Setback line means the distance between the street right-of-way line and the front wall of the main structure. In chapter 78 this distance is defined as the front yard. (This should not be confused with setback lines sometimes established by ordinance for the purpose of ultimate street widening, measured from the centerline of the right-of-way.) 
    Sight distance means the minimum extent of an unobstructed forward vision (in a horizontal plane) along a street from a vehicle located at any given point on a street. 
    Sketch plan means an informal plan indicating the salient existing features of the site and its surroundings as described in article II of this chapter and the general layout of a proposed subdivision. 
    Street means a public way for vehicular traffic, whether designated as a street, highway, thoroughfare, parkway, throughway, road, boulevard, lane, or place, or however designated. 
(1)  Alley means a minor roadway which is used primarily for vehicular service access to the back or side of properties otherwise abutting on a street. 
(2)  Arterial streets and highways means those which are used primarily for fast movement. 
(3)  Collector or feeder streets means those which carry traffic from minor streets to the major system of arterial streets or highways, including the principal entrance streets for residential development and streets for circulation within such a development. 
(4)  Expressway means a street or highway intended for fast moving and heavy traffic on which points of egress or ingress are limited and grade crossings are separated. 
(5)  Half street means a street generally parallel and adjacent to the boundary of a tract, having a lesser right-of-way width than required for a full width of the type involved. 
(6)  Marginal access street means minor streets which are parallel and adjacent to arterial streets and highways and which provide access to abutting properties and protection from traffic. 
(7)  Minor street means residential streets used primarily for access to abutting property. 
(8)  Parkway means streets with limited access on an exceptional right-of-way permitting marginal parkways for landscaping. 
    Subdivider and developer mean a person who undertakes the activities covered by this chapter, particularly the drawing up of a subdivision plat showing the layout of the land and the public improvements involved therein. Inasmuch as the subdivision plat is merely a necessary means to the end of ensuring a satisfactory development, the term "subdivider" is intended to include the term "developer" even though the persons involved in successive stages of the project may vary. 
    Subdivision means the division of a parcel of land into three or more lots or parcels either by plat into lots and blocks or by metes and bounds description for the purpose of transfer of ownership or development, or, if a new street is involved, any division of a parcel of land. A lot split shall not, for purposes of this chapter, be considered a subdivision. However, if a property becomes the subject of a lot split subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, any subsequent lot split involving the same parcel of land shall be subject to the subdivision requirements set forth in this chapter. Because all development orders and development permits issued by the village must be consistent with the village's comprehensive plan, and since adequate public facilities for transportation, sanitary sewer, potable water, drainage, solid waste disposal and recreation/open space must be available sufficient to maintain the village's adopted levels of service concurrent with the impacts of development, property owners in the village have no assurance that subdivision of lands in the village can be undertaken to the maximum extent that may be allowable under the provisions of chapter 78. 
    Village staff means the various department heads and administrative personnel of the village. 
(Ord. No. 29-13, § 1, 10-10-2013) 
Sec. 66-4. - Penalties. 
    Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances or special exceptions), after notice by a village official, shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided in section 1-14, or by any other lawful means available to the village, including the code enforcement special magistrate. In addition, the person convicted shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.

(d)  The subdivider shall submit to the department of community development, at least two weeks prior to a regular meeting of the village council, the original and ten copies of a sketch plan of the proposed subdivision for preliminary discussion to examine the scope of development contemplated, and its nature, and to explain how it will fit into the development pattern of the village. The sketch plan shall show the following features: 
(1)  The location of the land or site to be subdivided and the approximate area thereof. 
(2)  An indication of such natural features as unusual topography, low or swampy areas, rivers, lakes or waterways, mangroves, and environmentally sensitive land or habitat areas. 
(3)  An indication of the proximity of such utilities as water, sewers, drainage, and electric light and power, and how the subdivision will be served by each. 
(4)  The subdivision of existing lands, if any, surrounding or abutting the proposed site, notably the street pattern and adjacent subdivision lot layout. 
(5)  The relationship of the proposed subdivision to existing community facilities which serve or influence it such as main traffic arteries, railways, waterways, shopping or commercial centers, schools, parks and playgrounds or any other physical features that will enable the village council to determine how the subdivision will fit into the pattern of the community as a whole. 
(6)  Tentative lot and block lines, including proposed lot areas. 
Where a small or irregular tract of land will be created or may remain due to the development of a proposed subdivision, the village council may require that a practical plan for the development of the tract be submitted. Where a practical layout cannot be made, the village council may require revision of the proposed subdivision layout. 
(e)  After review by the village staff, copies of the sketch plan will be forwarded to the village council for consideration. If the sketch plan is disapproved, the village shall retain one copy and instruct the subdivider not to proceed with the subdivision unless and until a plan has been approved by the village council. 
(f)  Following the approval/approval with changes of the sketch plan, the subdivider may proceed to prepare a preliminary plat in accordance with the instructions contained in division 2 of this article. The subdivider may elect to combine the preliminary and final plat procedures.

Sec. 74-31. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Backflow prevention device. The customer is responsible for the installation and testing of all devices pursuant to the utility's backflow and cross connection control manual and water system installation requirements as adopted. 
    Developer means any property owner, business, builder or other entity proposing to develop property and seeking water services for property within the village's service area. 
    Developer agreement means a written agreement setting forth in detail the terms and conditions under which the village will provide water service to developer's property, and setting forth the obligations and requirements of each party to the agreement. 
    Equivalent residential connections (ERC) is a factor used to convert a given average daily flow to an equivalent number of residential connections. For this purpose, the average daily flow of one equivalent residential connection (ERC) is estimated at 350 gallons of water per day. 
(1)  Single-family residential includes detached residences, duplexes, triplexes, townhouses and one-story garden apartments. 
(2)  Multifamily residential includes individual residential units in a multifamily structure of one story and above served by one master meter. 
(3)  Irrigation service means metered connections used for the sole purpose of irrigating lawns and vegetation. Irrigation uses are converted to ERCs by dividing the water demand by 350 gallons of water per day. 
(4)  Nonresidential. All property devoted to industrial, commercial, educational, governmental or other nonresidential categories not covered by subsections (1) through (3) of this definition shall be considered to be nonresidential uses. Capital improvement charges to be paid to the village for nonresidential uses shall be calculated by determining the ERC of each use. The village will use statistical data published by the state department of health or other such agencies concerned with water consumption to determine the pertinent ERC calculations. Based upon such data, the village shall calculate the anticipated water consumption on a daily basis and divide such consumption by 350 gallons per day. The amount from such calculation shall then be multiplied by the capital improvement charge then in effect for single-family residential uses. No nonresidential use shall be less than one ERC. The village may, at its discretion, review consumption for any subsequent 12-month period and adjust capital improvement charges to correspond with that demand. Service may be terminated after due notice upon failure of customer to pay the adjusted capital improvement charge. 
    Village. Unless otherwise specified, the village may also be referred to as "utility."

(a)  Where the village has constructed or plans to construct stormwater facilities which are proposed to be used by a developer in lieu of a facility usually required to be constructed by a developer, the village may accept a capital contribution from the developer and waive certain construction requirements. 
(b)  Procedures and standards developed by the village shall define appropriate means by which to optimize the developer's capital contributions in the construction or refunding of stormwater systems. These capital contributions shall take the form of fee in lieu of or availability charges. Each situation will be analyzed by the village and a specific written decision will be developed. The application of each is defined as follows: 
(1)  The fee in lieu of is applied to a site-specific negotiated procedure, wherein a development's stormwater contribution (quantity and quality) is assessed its share of the capital needs of the facilities required to serve the development in question. This capital contribution would be used for the construction or refunding of village-owned stormwater facilities. The process does not apply where the stormwater facilities are privately held. Each application is evaluated against the village's master plan, or, where the master plan is incomplete, against the cumulative impacts from the development. 
(2)  The availability charge is administered on a site-specific basis identical to the fee in lieu of procedure noted in subsection (b)(1) of this section. The only difference is that the capital investment advanced by the village in implementing a stormwater facility is now recovered through an availability charge. The capital charge is determined on a pro rata share of a capacity used by the new applicant as measured by the cumulative impact from the development upon all impacted facilities applied to the present worth of the original capital expenditure. In the case of a developer constructing stormwater management facilities in excess of the site needs, the village may enter into an agreement with that developer to rebate the fee in lieu of charges paid to the village by other developers utilizing those facilities over a period of time not exceeding seven years from the date of the agreement. 
(c)  All development subject to the provisions of section 74-207 shall pay a fee calculated consistent with section 74-208.

(1)  Hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this chapter or of any ordinance adopted pursuant thereto. 
(2)  Authorize upon application in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. The power to grant any such variance shall be limited by and contingent upon a finding by the planning and zoning board or village council that: 
a.  Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same zoning district. 
b.  The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant. 
c.  Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, buildings or structures in the same zoning district. 
d.  Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the terms of this chapter and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant. 
e.  The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure. 
f.  The grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this chapter and such variance will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
(b)  In granting any variance, the planning and zoning board or village council may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter and any other ordinance enacted by the village council. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. Conditions and safeguards shall be related to the proposed development and shall be roughly proportional to the anticipated impacts of the proposed development. 
(c)  In reviewing matters brought before it pursuant to the provisions of this article, neither the planning and zoning board nor the village council shall exercise authority or jurisdiction over matters which are specifically reserved to other officers, boards or agencies of the village. Where site plan review is necessitated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, no decision of the planning and zoning board or the village council with respect to a variance, or other matter, pertaining to the property in questions shall obviate the necessity for such site plan review. Where a requested building permit has been withheld by the building official for want of compliance with applicable laws and ordinances beyond the jurisdiction of the planning and zoning board or the village council, no building permit shall be issued regardless of any decision of the planning and zoning board or village council until the requirements of such laws and ordinances have been met. 
(d)  Under no circumstances shall the planning and zoning board or the village council grant a variance to permit a use not generally or by special exception permitted in the zoning district involved or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this chapter in the zoning district.

Examples of appropriate commercial uses for a PCD include, but are not limited to, business services and offices, professional services, personal services, restaurants, health and fitness centers, and small-scale specialty retail sales and services. Consideration should be given as to whether a proposed commercial use, which may otherwise be a permitted commercial use in the C-2 zoning district, would be incompatible, inappropriate, and an unsuitable use when joined with residential uses. Only commercial uses, which are permitted by right in the C-2 zoning district, are allowed within a PCD. 
    Commercial uses which are blended with residential uses in a PCD, are intended to serve the residents of the entire village, and not just the residents of the PCD. Commercial uses within a PCD must be open to the general public and shall not be limited to use only by the residents of the PCD. The proposed commercial uses for the PCD must be identified by the time the special exception request is reviewed by village council, and at that time, the petitioner must provide the village council with details concerning the hours of operation of each commercial use, the estimated square footage of each commercial use, the estimated number of employees for each commercial use, the estimated number of consumers or users of each commercial use, the amount of parking to be dedicated to employees and users of the commercial uses, and any other additional information that the village council may reasonably require in their review of the special exception request for approval of a PCD use. 
    The design and architecture of the PCD shall result in a cohesive, innovative structure, with architectural significance, preserving existing trees and other natural features on the site, and integrating open spaces and common areas. The use of open space squares, plazas, passive parks, courtyards, loggias, colonnades, walkways, fountains, connections between buildings, common areas, pedestrian linkages, recreational areas and other public spaces where people may congregate socially and recreationally is encouraged. 
    PCD's shall be designed to promote unimpeded pedestrian circulation and reduce the number and length of vehicular trips. The buildings shall be strategically placed to allow residents and consumers to circulate and access their destinations without having to return to their vehicles to reach each destination within the PCD.

Sec. 78-252. - Applicability of land development regulations to planned commercial developments. 
    Although planned commercial developments produced in compliance with the provisions and requirements in this article and other regulations as set forth and defined in this chapter may, except for dwelling unit density regulations, depart from the strict application of property development regulations for the district in which the planned commercial development is proposed to be located, such developments are to be in compliance with the village's comprehensive development plan, and platted of record in accordance with the procedures for approval of subdivision plats in chapter 66. 
(Code 1977, app. A, § IX-A(B); Ord. No. 605, § 5, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 78-253. - Conflicts with other regulations. 
    Where conflicts exist between the special planned commercial development regulations in this article and general zoning, subdivision, and other applicable ordinance provisions, the special regulations in this article shall apply. 
(Code 1977, app. A, § IX-A(C); Ord. No. 605, § 5, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 78-254. - Special definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. All definitions appearing in section 78-4, shall be applicable to this article except to the extent of inconsistency with any special definitions contained in this section. 
    Planned commercial development (PCD) means a contiguous tract of land which functions as a self-contained and readily identifiable development which accommodates a variety of predetermined commercial and residential uses and/or mix of such uses in well-planned development. An increased use of open space and common areas is encouraged to complement the overall development. Flexibility of site design allows for deviation from standard site development regulations of the zoning district in which the development is located. PCDs not only allow for combining various building types and uses, but also allow for compatible mixed use within buildings and structures through an approved architectural style. The entire land area of a PCD must be under unity of title, and be planned and designed to be developed in a single operation or by a series of prescheduled development phases, according to an officially approved master site plan which is subject to the site plan review process.

In formulating a conceptual plan for a proposed PCD, the special exception petitioner shall strictly comply with the requirements of section 78-370, and at a minimum, the conceptual plan shall address items 1. through 11. of section 78-370(b). In addition, the site plan application content and process by which a PCD shall be reviewed and acted upon by the village council, shall be the same as those provided for in article IX, division 2 of this chapter, together with the applicable portions of this article if additional building height is requested. 
(10)  Platting. Each plat for a PCD shall be in compliance with the provisions of F.S. ch. 177. 
(11)  Development phasing controls. Should a PCD be constructed in phases, in addition to the requirements of article IX, division 2 of this chapter, the following sequence must be adhered to: 
a.  If a residential land area is planned as part of a PCD, it shall not be platted without the platting of any commercial land area. 
b.  If residential dwellings are to be constructed as part of a commercial building in a PCD, the residential dwellings shall be located only within, or as an integral part of the main buildings; however, the residential dwellings shall not be issued a certificate of occupancy prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the commercial occupancy of the main buildings.

Sec. 78-256. - PCD design standards; waivers. 
    Design standards for PCD's are as follows: 
(1)  Waivers. As a basis for the preparation of an application for special exception approval, conceptual plan approval, site plan approval, or any future modifications thereto, which may occur subsequent to the initial review and PCD approval, the development of the PCD shall be guided by the regulations contained in this section, together with the requirements of sections 78-255 and 78-257. However, as part of the site plan review and approval process, the village council may waive regulations for the PCD set forth in this article, except for building height requirements, density requirements, requirements associated with concurrency management, and requirements for the preservation of environmentally sensitive lands provided that the spirit and intent of this chapter are complied with in the total development of the PCD, and community benefits such as architectural design, pedestrian amenities, preservation of environmentally sensitive lands, provision of public parks and open space, or mixed uses result in reduced impacts on village services are demonstrated. For purposes hereof, a waiver is defined as a reduction in a development standard or other land development requirement normally required by this article. 
(2)  Waiver procedure. The grant of a waiver from the requirements applicable to a PCD, shall be made by the village council, following an advisory recommendation by the village planning and zoning board. All requests for waivers must be submitted in writing and accompany a development order application for the PCD.

Secs. 78-336-78-360. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES 

Sec. 78-361. - Purpose. 
    The development and execution of a zoning ordinance is based upon the division of the village into districts, within which the use of land and structures and the bulk and location of structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are certain uses and features which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be distinctly classified or regulated in a particular district without consideration in each case of the impact of such uses and features upon neighboring uses and the surrounding area, compared with the public need for them at particular locations. Such uses and features are therefore treated as special exceptions. A special exception is not the automatic right of any applicant. 
(Code 1977, app. A, § X(J)(1)) 
Sec. 78-362. - Applicability. 
    All initial requests for special exception uses as listed in this chapter, along with their related accessory uses shall be subject to the requirements of this division. In addition, any modification to the use of a previously granted special exception, except for a modification that changes said use to a permitted use as listed in this chapter, shall be subject to the requirements of this division. Requests to expand, enlarge or revise the site of an existing special exception use shall be classified and processed pursuant to the following three categories; 
(1)  Small scale, interior - interior expansion, enlargement or revision of less than ten percent (10%) of the originally approved special exception site square footage and having construction costs of less than $50,000.00, once within any eighteen month period (this category contemplates uses located in existing shopping centers or similar structures, where no change to the overall building footprint is required). 
a.  Applicant shall submit the processing fee in an amount established by resolution of the village council and on file in the village clerk's office. 
b.  Review and approval is provided by the community development director, following which, the applicant may apply for building permits. 
(2)  Small scale, exterior - exterior expansion, enlargement or revision of less than ten percent (10%) of the originally approved special exception site square footage and having construction costs of less than $50,000.00 once within any eighteen month period (this category contemplates a change to the existing structure's footprint, and other site related revisions that flow therefrom). 
a.  Applicant shall submit the processing fee in an amount established by resolution of the village council and on file in the village clerk's office. 
b.  Review and approval regarding the continuing special exception use is provided by the community development director, following which, the applicant shall submit an application for site plan modification. 
When reviewing small scale expansion, enlargement or revision, the community development director shall make a determination that such expansion, enlargement or revision does not result in a violation of the requirements of sections 78-363 or 78-364, or a violation of any previously imposed condition of approval. 
(3)  Large scale - any expansion, enlargement or revision to the site of an existing special exception use that does not qualify as either small scale interior or small scale exterior. Such expansion, enlargement or revision is subject to the requirements of this division. 
(Ord. No. 19-11, § 1, 11-10-2011; Ord. No. 7-19, § 4, 4-11-2019) 
Sec. 78-363. - Criteria. 
    Special exception uses to which this division applies as set forth in section 78-362 shall be permitted only upon authorization of the village council provided that such uses shall be found by the village council to comply with the following requirements:

Sec. 78-364. - Findings required for approval. 
    Before any special exception to which this division applies as set forth in section 78-362 is granted, the village council shall apply the standards set forth in this division and shall determine that satisfactory provision and arrangement of the following factors have been met by the petitioner, where applicable: 
(1)  Compliance with all elements of the village comprehensive plan. 
(2)  Ingress and egress to property and proposed structures thereon with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control, and access in case of fire or catastrophe.

(Ord. No. 39-13, § 1, 2-13-14) 
Sec. 78-394. - Florida-friendly landscaping general provisions; design standards. 
(a)  General provisions. Within the Village of Tequesta the principles of Florida-friendly landscaping shall be incorporated into all landscape designs. These include the following: 
(1)  Preserving existing native trees and vegetation, if appropriate and feasible. Where established natural vegetation is incorporated into the landscape design, irrigation of those areas shall not be required. 
(2)  The plant palette and irrigation system shall be appropriate for site conditions, taking into account that, in some cases, soil improvements can enhance water use efficiency. Drought resistant plants are emphasized. 
(3)  Plants shall be grouped together by irrigation demand. 
(4)  The percentage of landscaped area in irrigated high water use hydrozones shall be minimized. The maximum percentage of irrigated landscape area that may be included in high water use hydrozones, excluding turfgrass, shall not exceed 20 percent. These high water use limits shall not apply to landscaped areas requiring large amounts of turf for their primary functions, e.g., ball fields and playgrounds. 
(5)  Soil improvements are encouraged to improve the soil with organic materials prior to the installation of any irrigation system. 
(6)  An efficient irrigation system shall be required and designed according to the water needs of the planting groups. 
(7)  Reclaimed or non-potable water should be used for irrigation if an acceptable source is determined to be available by the village utilities department. 
(8)  Low impact design principles such as bio-swales, bio-retention areas and other creative stormwater management techniques. 
(b)  Design standards. 
(1)  Site designs and landscape construction documents shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of all applicable Florida Statutes. All landscape and irrigation system design shall be consistent with the standards required under F.S. § 373.228. 
(2)  Site plans for new development shall include riparian buffers adjoining all waters of the state. Such buffers should be native, or if previously disturbed, then constructed to be at least 25 feet, and preferably 50-150 feet wide, to protect water bodies from nonpoint source pollution generated by up gradient development. Riparian buffers shall be designed and managed in accordance with USDA-NRCS conservation practices for riparian buffers and filter strips (codes 390, 391, and 393). Such riparian areas may be included in the gross development area for purposes of determining zoning density. 
(3)  Site plans shall consider natural drainage features to minimize run-off. The use of pervious surfaces and areas is preferred; therefore impervious surface and material within landscaped areas shall be limited to borders, sidewalks, step stones and other similar material and shall not exceed ten percent of the landscaped areas. Use of pervious paving material for driveways and sidewalks is strongly encouraged. A maintenance plan may be required for certain pervious products to ensure that they remain pervious in the long term. Non-living landscape material shall not be used as major landscape ground cover. In no case shall these materials exceed ten percent of the landscape area as they increase the need for herbicide use, have no habitat value, reflect rather than absorb heat and do not produce oxygen like plants. 
(4)  Site plans shall detail, at a minimum, all vegetated areas to be preserved by species. 
(Ord. No. 39-13, § 1, 2-13-14) 
Sec. 78-395. - Shoreline considerations. 
(a)  Grading and design of property adjacent to bodies of water shall conform to federal, state and local regulations which may include, but is not limited to, the use of berms and/or swales to intercept surface runoff of water and debris that may contain fertilizers or pesticides. 
(b)  A voluntary six-foot low maintenance zone is recommended, but not mandated, from any pond, stream, water course, lake, wetland or from the top of a seawall. A swale/berm system is recommended for installation at the landward edge of the low maintenance zone to capture and filter runoff. No mowed or cut vegetative material should be deposited or left remaining in this zone or deposited in the water. Care should be taken to prevent the over-spray of aquatic weed products in this zone. 
(C)  When mowing near the shoreline, direct the chute away from the water body. Riparian or littoral zone plants that do not require mowing or fertilization should be planted in these areas. See the Florida Waterfront Property Owners Guide or the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's Invasive Plant Management Section for more information. 
(D)  Mangrove trimming shall be performed in accordance with F.S. §§ 403.9321-403.9334. 
(Ord. No. 39-13, § 1, 2-13-14) 
Sec. 78-396. - Turf areas and soils. 
(a)  All turf areas shall be sodded using species suitable as permanent lawns in Tequesta. Where appropriate, turf species that require minimum irrigation are encouraged. The type and location of turf areas shall be selected in the same manner as with all other plantings. Irrigated turf areas shall be consolidated and limited to those areas on the site that receive pedestrian traffic, provide for recreational use, provide cover for septic tank drainfields, or provide soil erosion control such as on slopes or in swales; and where turf is used as a design unifier, or other similar practical use. As a matter of public safety, no turf that requires mowing shall be allowed on slopes greater than 4:1 or within six feet of the water's edge, except where adjacent to seawalls and bulkheads or needed to control erosion. Turf areas shall be identified on the landscape plan when a landscape plan is required. 
(b)  Soils vary from site to site and even within a given site. Soil analysis information is needed for proper selection of plants and, if needed, soil amendments. A soil analysis based on random sampling is required and shall be performed by a reputable soil testing lab or University of Florida/IFAS Cooperative Extension facility. Any new soil required shall be similar to the existing soil in pH, texture, permeability and other characteristics, unless convincing evidence is provided that a different type of soil amendment approach is justified. The use of solid waste compost as a soil amendment is encouraged.

Any dead vegetation and landscaping material shall be promptly replaced with healthy, living plantings. Vegetation proximally located to electric utility lines shall also be maintained pursuant to section 74-2. 
(2)  Landscape maintenance for hire shall be performed in accordance with recommendation in the Florida-Friendly Best Management Practices for Protection of Water Resources by the Green Industries. Landscape maintenance by homeowners should be performed in accordance with recommendations of the University of Florida Cooperative Extension Service and Florida Yards and Neighborhoods publications. 
(3)  A regular irrigation maintenance schedule shall be included, but not be limited to, checking, adjusting, and repairing irrigation equipment; and resetting the automatic controller according to the season yearly. 
(4)  Pruning of trees shall be permitted to allow for healthy growth, and to promote safety considerations. Trees which cause a conflict with views, signage or lighting shall not be pruned more than the maximum allowed. The village manager, community development director or building official may suspend the provisions of this section in case of a natural disaster. The removal of any tree shall be pursuant to the applicable provisions of article VII of chapter 50. 
a.  A maximum of one-fourth of tree canopy may be removed from a tree within a one-year period, provided that the removal conforms to the standards of crown reduction, crown cleaning, crown thinning, crown raising, vista pruning, and crown restoration pruning techniques. All pruning shall comply with the American National Standards Institute, ANSI 300 (Tree, Shrub and other Woody Plant Maintenance), as amended. 
b.  If other than the mature height and spread is desired for any required tree, the size and shape shall be indicated on an approved landscape plan. Shaping of a tree shall be permitted if the tree is to be used as an accent, focal point or as part of an overall landscape design. A maintenance commitment shall be clearly outlined on the approved landscape plan to explain the care and upkeep of a shaped tree. 
c.  Hatracking (tree topping), as defined in this division, is strictly prohibited. 
d.  The following shall be exempt from the requirements of the above tree pruning regulations; however, removal of any such tree shall be pursuant to the applicable provisions of article VII of chapter 50: 
i.  Trees affected by FAA and airport safety regulations. 
ii.  Trees which interfere with safe site triangles, utility lines, or utility structures. Electric utilities shall prune trees in proximity to overhead power lines pursuant to section 74-2.

DIVISION 5. - WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS AND ANTENNAS; AND SATELLITE DISHES 

Sec. 78-441. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to establish general guidelines for the siting and construction of wireless communications towers, satellite dishes and antennas. The goals of this division are to: 
(1)  Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers, satellite dishes and antennas; 
(2)  Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas; 
(3)  Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community; 
(4)  Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; 
(5)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; 
(6)  Encourage users of towers, satellite dishes and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
(7)  Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently; 
(8)  Consider the public health and safety of communication towers; and 
(9)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures. 
    In furtherance of these goals, the village shall give due consideration to the village's comprehensive plan, zoning map, existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of towers and antennas.

(f)  Nonprofit enterprises. 
(1)  The village may issue non-profit permits to any person or organization for the conduct or operation of occasional sales and/or fundraising projects held by nonprofit enterprises, either regularly or temporarily, when the applicant signs an affidavit that the applicant operates without private profit, for a civic, public, charitable, youth, service, educational, literary, fraternal, or religious purpose.

Sec. 78-771. - Title. 
    This article and these regulations shall be known as the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance of the Village of Tequesta. 
(Ord. No. 9-12, § 1, 11-8-2012) 
Sec. 78-772. - Scope. 
    The provisions of this article shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area within the Village of Tequesta, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(Ord. No. 9-12, § 1, 11-8-2012) 
Sec. 78-773. - Intent. 
    The purposes of this article and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22.

(Ord. No. 9-12, § 1, 11-8-2012) 
Sec. 78-775. - Warning. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article and the Florida Building Code, as amended by the Village of Tequesta, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on the flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of Title 44 C.F.R., Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring the Village of Tequesta to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this article. 
(Ord. No. 9-12, § 1, 11-8-2012) 
Sec. 78-776. - Disclaimer of liability.

Subdivision 2. - Applicability 

Sec. 78-777. - General.

(1)  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this article or the required elevation standards; 
(2)  Determination by the building board of adjustment that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

Sec. 78-870. - Authority. 
    This code is enacted under the home rule power of the Village of Tequesta, in the interest of the health, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of the Village of Tequesta, hereinafter the "village". 
(Ord. No. 15-14, § 2, 10-9-2014) 
Sec. 78-871. - Scope. 
    This adult entertainment code shall be in effect throughout the village. 
(Ord. No. 15-14, § 2, 10-9-2014) 
Sec. 78-872. - Purpose and intent. 
    The intent of the Village of Tequesta Council in adopting this code is to establish reasonable and uniform regulations for the adult entertainment industry that will protect the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the village. It is not the intent of the Village of Tequesta Council to legislate with respect to matters of obscenity. These matters are regulated by federal and state law, including Chapter 847 of the Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 15-14, § 2, 10-9-2014) 
Sec. 78-873. - Findings of fact. 
    Based on the evidence and testimony presented at the public hearings before the village council and on the findings incorporated in the United States Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986), "A Summary of a National Survey of Real Estate Appraisers Regarding the Effect of Adult Bookstores on Property Values," conducted by the division of planning, department of metropolitan development, City of Indianapolis, January, 1984, the village council hereby finds the following: 
(a)  Uses exist or may exist within nearby unincorporated Palm Beach County or other nearby cities where books, magazines, motion pictures, prints, photographs, periodicals, records, novelties and/or other devices that depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities are possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold. 
(b)  Adult entertainment establishments exist or may exist within the village and other nearby cities or counties where dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical area; or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers. 
(c)  The activities described in subsections (a) and/or (b) occur at adult entertainment establishments which operate for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the village in the interest of health, safety, economy, property, values, and general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the village. A major industry which is important to the community's economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to visit attractions who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere. 
(d)  When the activities described in subsections (a) and/or (b) above are presented, other activities that are illegal, immoral or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and land. 
(e)  When the activities described in subsections (a) and/or (b) above are present, they tend to blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower property values, promote crime, and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(f)  The concurrence of the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (a) and/or (b) leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community. 
(g)  The concurrence of the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (a) and/or (b) creates additional hazards to the health and safety of persons in attendance and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life, tone of commerce, and community environment. 
(h)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the village, it is necessary and advisable for the village to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages at adult entertainment establishments where the activities described in subsections (a) and/or (b), occur. 
(i)  There is a direct relationship between the activities described in subsections (a) and/or (b) above and an increase in criminal activities, moral degradation and disturbances of the peace and good order of the community, and the occurrence of these activities is hazardous to the health and safety of those persons in attendance and tends to depreciate the value of adjoining land and harm the economic welfare of the community as a whole. These secondary effects are adverse to the public's interest and quality of life, the tone of commerce and the community environment in the Village of Tequesta. 
(j)  Based upon these findings, it is in the interest of the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the Village of Tequesta that adult entertainment uses are regulated pursuant to the following standards.

Section 1. - [Grant of franchise.] 
    There is hereby granted to Florida Power & Light Company, its successors and assigns (hereinafter called the "Grantee"), for the period of 30 years from the effective date hereof, the nonexclusive right, privilege and franchise (hereinafter called "franchise") to construct, operate and maintain in, under, upon, along, over and across the present and future roads, streets, alleys, bridges, easements, rights-of-way and other public places (hereinafter called "public rights-of-way") throughout all of the incorporated areas, as such incorporated areas may be constituted from time to time, of the Village of Tequesta, Florida, and its successors (hereinafter called the "Grantor"), in accordance with the Grantee's customary practice with respect to construction and maintenance, electric light and power facilities, including, without limitation, conduits, poles, wires, transmission and distribution lines, and all other facilities installed in conjunction with or ancillary to all of the Grantee's operations (hereinafter called "facilities"), for the purpose of supplying electricity and other services to the Grantor and its successors, the inhabitants thereof, and persons beyond the limits thereof. 
Section 2. - [Grantee facilities.] 
    The facilities of the Grantee shall be installed, located or relocated so as to not unreasonably interfere with traffic over the public rights-of-way or with reasonable egress from and ingress to abutting property. To avoid conflicts with traffic, the location or relocation of all facilities shall be made as representatives of the Grantor may prescribe in accordance with the Grantor's reasonable rules and regulations with reference to the placing and maintaining in, under, upon, along, over and across said public rights-of-way; provided, however, that such rules or regulations (a) shall not prohibit the exercise of the Grantee's right to use said public rights-of-way for reasons other than unreasonable interference with motor vehicular traffic, (b) shall not unreasonably interfere with the Grantee's ability to furnish reasonably sufficient, adequate and efficient electric service to all of its customers, and (c) shall not require the relocation of any of the Grantee's facilities installed before or after the effective date hereof in public rights-of-way unless or until widening or otherwise changing the configuration of the paved portion of any public right-of-way used by motor vehicles causes such installed facilities to unreasonably interfere with motor vehicular traffic. Such rules and regulations shall recognize that above-grade facilities of the Grantee installed after the effective date hereof should be installed near the outer boundaries of the public rights-of-way to the extent possible. When any portion of a public right-of-way is excavated by the Grantee in the location or relocation of any of its facilities, the portion of the public right-of-way so excavated shall within a reasonable time be replaced by the Grantee at its expense and in as good condition as it was at the time of such excavation. The Grantor shall not be liable to the Grantee for any cost or expense in connection with any relocation of the Grantee's facilities required under subsection (c) of this Section, except, however, the Grantee shall be entitled to reimbursement of its costs from others and as may be provided by law. 
Section 3. - [Indemnification of grantor.] 
    The Grantor shall in no way be liable or responsible for any accident or damage that may occur in the construction, operation or maintenance by the Grantee of its facilities hereunder, and the acceptance of this ordinance shall be deemed an agreement on the part of the Grantee to indemnify the Grantor and hold it harmless against any and all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense which may accrue to the Grantor by reason of the negligence, default or misconduct of the Grantee in the construction, operation or maintenance of its facilities hereunder. 
Section 4. - [Rates, rules, and regulations.] 
    All rates and rules and regulations established by the Grantee from time to time shall be subject to such regulation as may be provided by law. 
Section 5. - [Fees and charges.] 
    As a consideration for this franchise, the Grantee shall pay to the Grantor, commencing 90 days after the effective date hereof, and each month thereafter for the remainder of the term of this franchise, an amount which added to the amount of all licenses, excises, fees, charges and other impositions of any kind whatsoever (except ad valorem property taxes and non-ad valorem tax assessments on property) levied or imposed by the Grantor against the Grantee's property, business or operations and those of its subsidiaries during the Grantee's monthly billing period ending 60 days prior to each such payment will equal 6.0 percent of the Grantee's billed revenues, less actual write-offs, from the sale of electrical energy to residential, commercial and industrial customers (as such customers are defined by FPL's tariff) within the incorporated areas of the Grantor for the monthly billing period ending 60 days prior to each such payment, and in no event shall payment for the rights and privileges granted herein exceed 6.0 percent of such revenues for any monthly billing period of the Grantee. 
    The Grantor understands and agrees that such revenues as described in the preceding paragraph are limited, as in the existing franchise Ordinance No. 331, to the precise revenues described therein, and that such revenues do not include, by way of example and not limitation: (a) revenues from the sale of electrical energy for Public Street and Highway Lighting (service for lighting public ways and areas); (b) revenues from Other Sales to Public Authorities (service with eligibility restricted to governmental entities); (c) revenues from Sales to Railroads and Railways (service supplied for propulsion of electric transit vehicles); (d) revenues from Sales for Resale (service to other utilities for resale purposes); (e) franchise fees; (f) Late Payment Charges; (g) Field Collection Charges; (h) other service charges. 
Section 6. - [Agreement.] 
    As a further consideration, during the term of this franchise or any extension thereof, the Grantor agrees: (a) not to engage in the distribution and/or sale, in competition with the Grantee, of electric capacity and/or electric energy to any ultimate consumer of electric utility service (herein called a "retail customer") or to any electrical distribution system established solely to serve any retail customer formerly served by the Grantee, (b) not to participate in any proceeding or contractual arrangement, the purpose or terms of which would be to obligate the Grantee to transmit and/or distribute, electric capacity and/or electric energy from any third party(ies) to any other retail customer's facility(ies), and (c) not to seek to have the Grantee transmit and/or distribute electric capacity and/or electric energy generated by or on behalf of the Grantor at one location to the Grantor's facility(ies) at any other location(s). Nothing specified herein shall prohibit the Grantor from engaging with other utilities or persons in wholesale transactions which are subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act. 
    Nothing herein shall prohibit the Grantor, if permitted by law, (i) from purchasing electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other person, or (ii) from seeking to have the Grantee transmit and/or distribute to any facility(ies) of the Grantor electric capacity and/or electric energy purchased by the Grantor from any other person; provided, however, that before the Grantor elects to purchase electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other person, the Grantor shall notify the Grantee. Such notice shall include a summary of the specific rates, terms and conditions which have been offered by the other person and identify the Grantor's facilities to be served under the offer. The Grantee shall thereafter have 90 days to evaluate the offer and, if the Grantee offers rates, terms and conditions which are equal to or better than those offered by the other person, the Grantor shall be obligated to continue to purchase from the Grantee electric capacity and/or electric energy to serve the previously-identified facilities of the Grantor for a term no shorter than that offered by the other person. If the Grantee does not agree to rates, terms and conditions which equal or better the other person's offer, all of the terms and conditions of this franchise shall remain in effect. 
    If during the term of this Franchise Agreement the Grantee enters into a franchise agreement with any other municipality or county government located in St. Lucie, Martin, Palm Beach or Broward County, where the number of Grantee's active electrical customers is equal to or less than the number of Grantor's active electrical customers within the incorporated areas of Grantor, the terms of which provide for the payment of franchise fees by the Grantee at a rate greater than 6.0 percent of the Grantee's billed revenues, less actual write-offs, from the sale of electrical energy to residential, commercial and industrial customers (as such customers are defined by FPL's tariff), under the same terms and conditions as specified in Section 5 (the "triggering franchise"), then the Grantee, upon written request from the Grantor, shall negotiate and enter into a new franchise agreement with the Grantor in which the percentage to be used in calculating monthly payments as specified in Section 5, using the same terms and conditions as specified in Section 5, shall be the greater rate provided in the triggering franchise; provided, however, that if the triggering franchise contains additional benefits given to the Grantee in exchange for the increased franchise rate, and such additional benefits are not contained in this Franchise Agreement, then the Grantee shall have discretion to include within such new franchise agreement with the Grantor the additional benefits found within the triggering franchise. 
Section 7. - [Intent to terminate.] 
    If the Grantor grants a right, privilege or franchise to any other person or otherwise enables any other such person to construct, operate or maintain electric light and power facilities within any part of the incorporated areas of the Grantor in which the Grantee may lawfully serve or compete on terms and conditions which the Grantee reasonably determines are more favorable than the terms and conditions contained herein, the Grantee may at any time thereafter terminate this franchise if such terms and conditions are not remedied within the time period provided hereafter. The Grantee shall give the Grantor at least 90 days advance written notice of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the Grantee herein, advise the Grantor of such terms and conditions that it reasonably considers more favorable. The Grantor shall then have 90 days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the more favorable terms and conditions complained of by the Grantee. If the Grantee reasonably determines that such terms or conditions are not remedied by the Grantor within said time period, the Grantee may terminate this franchise agreement by delivering written notice to the Grantor's Clerk and termination shall be effective on the date of delivery of such notice. 
Section 8. - [Legislative consequence.] 
    If as a direct or indirect consequence of any legislative, regulatory or other action by the United States of America or the State of Florida (or any department, agency, authority, instrumentality or political subdivision of either of them) any person is permitted to provide electric service within the incorporated areas of the Grantor to a customer then being served by the Grantee, or to any new applicant for electric service within any part of the incorporated areas of the Grantor in which the Grantee may lawfully serve, and the Grantee determines that its obligations hereunder, or otherwise resulting from this franchise in respect to rates and service, place it at a competitive disadvantage with respect to such other person, the Grantee may, at any time after the taking of such action, terminate this franchise if such competitive disadvantage is not remedied within the time period provided hereafter. The Grantee shall give the Grantor at least 90 days advance written notice of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the Grantee herein, advise the Grantor of the consequences of such action which resulted in the competitive disadvantage. The Grantor shall then have 90 days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the competitive disadvantage. If such competitive disadvantage is not remedied by the Grantor within said time period, the Grantee may terminate this franchise agreement by delivering written notice to the Grantor's Clerk and termination shall take effect on the date of delivery of such notice. 
Section 9. - [Forfeiture.] 
    Failure on the part of the Grantee to comply in any substantial respect with any of the provisions of this franchise shall be grounds for forfeiture, but no such forfeiture shall take effect if the reasonableness or propriety thereof is protested by the Grantee until there is final determination (after the expiration or exhaustion of all rights of appeal) by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Grantee has failed to comply in a substantial respect with any of the provisions of this franchise, and the Grantee shall have six months after such final determination to make good the default before a forfeiture shall result with the right of the Grantor at its discretion to grant such additional time to the Grantee for compliance as necessities in the case require. 
Section 10. - [Failure to comply.] 
    Failure on the part of the Grantor to comply in substantial respect with any of the provisions of this ordinance, including but not limited to: (a) denying the Grantee use of public rights-of-way for reasons other than unreasonable interference with motor vehicular traffic; (b) imposing conditions for use of public rights-of-way contrary to Florida law or the terms and conditions of this franchise; (c) unreasonable delay in issuing the Grantee a use permit, if any, to construct its facilities in public rights-of-way, shall constitute breach of this franchise and entitle the Grantee to withhold all or part of the payments provided for in Section 5 hereof until such time as a use permit is issued or a court of competent jurisdiction has reached a final determination in the matter. The Grantor recognizes and agrees that nothing in this franchise agreement constitutes or shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of the Grantee's delegated sovereign right of condemnation and that the Grantee, in its sole discretion, may exercise such right. 
Section 11. - [Record examination.] 
    The Grantor may, upon reasonable notice and within 90 days after each anniversary date of this franchise, at the Grantor's expense, examine the records of the Grantee relating to the calculation of the franchise payment for the year preceding such anniversary date. Such examination shall be during normal business hours at the Grantee's office where such records are maintained. Records not prepared by the Grantee in the ordinary course of business may be provided at the Grantor's expense and as the Grantor and the Grantee may agree in writing. Information identifying the Grantee's customers by name or their electric consumption shall not be taken from the Grantee's premises. Such audit shall be impartial and all audit findings, whether they decrease or increase payment to the Grantor, shall be reported to the Grantee. The Grantor's right to examine the records of the Grantee in accordance with this Section shall not be conducted by any third party employed by the Grantor whose fee, in whole or part, for conducting such audit is contingent on findings of the audit. 
    Grantor waives, settles and bars all claims relating in any way to the amounts paid by the Grantee under the Current Franchise Agreement embodied in Ordinance No. 331. 
Section 12. - [Severability.] 
    The provisions of this ordinance are interdependent upon one another, and if any of the provisions of this ordinance are found or adjudged to be invalid, illegal, void or of no effect, the entire ordinance shall be null and void and of no force or effect.
