PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Citronelle. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1962 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1962 Code, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-1.1, 3-1.2 and 3-1.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of B. Meade White, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Diane D. Barnett, CMC, City Clerk, and Norman J. Gale, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(5)	Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-7. - Altering Code.

(6)	Population composition of districts by race (1990 U.S. census data). 
District Total White Nonwhite Percent Nonwhite 1 706 208 498 71 2 752 685 67 8 3 716 689 27 3 4 755 718 37 4 5   742   627 115 12 Total 3,671 2,927 744 20  
(7)	Methodology of population allocation by district. The 1990 U.S. census of population figure of three thousand six hundred seventy-one (3,671) for the city was used as the base population number. This total was divided by five (5), the number of single-member city council districts to obtain the average number of persons to be allocated per district. 
3,671 divided by 5 = 734 persons per district 
This number seven hundred thirty-four (734) ;pm; five (5) percent deviation allowed by the U.S. Justice Department, was then used as the goal for re-establishment of the single-member districts. Thus, the ideal district would have seven hundred thirty-four (734) people in it, but could have as few as six hundred ninety-seven (697) or as many as seven hundred seventy-one (771) and be within the limits of deviation. The maximum difference in number of persons between the highest permissible number per district and the lowest permissible number per district is seventy-four (74).

Section K101 of the building code is amended to read as follows: 
"(1)	General: For all construction, whether residential or commercial a permit fee of four dollars and twenty-five cents ($4.25) per one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) of estimated value shall be applied. An additional charge shall be made at the rate of two dollars ($2.00) per external outlet for gas, electrical and plumbing outlets. The estimation of value shall be determined as follows: 
Residential construction 
(frame, brick, etc.) $10.00 per sq. ft. living area 
  5.00 per sq. ft. carports, patios, garages & porches  
Example: 
1,000 sq. ft. living area × $10.00 = $10,000.00 
200 sq. ft. carport × $5.00 = $1,000.00 
200 sq. ft. patio × $5.00 = $1,000.00 
Total value = $12,000.00 
*Assuming one each external outlet for gas, electrical and plumbing, the permit cost would be: 
$12,000.00 × $4.25 per 1,000 value + $6.00 (outlet charge) = $57.00 permit cost 
Commercial buildings: 
Same as above except $20.00 sq. ft. or the contractor price whichever is the greater. 
(2)	Open air buildings: Permit fees for commercial open air buildings such as pavilions and other such structures that are not fully enclosed are to pay a permit fee of ten dollars ($10.00) per square foot (one-half (1/2) the normal commercial rate). The determination as to whether the proposed construction meets the criteria for commercial open air construction permitting is to be made solely by the city. 
(3)	Roofing inspection: There is hereby established a fee for the inspection of the roofing of new construction or the reroofing of existing construction, whether it be commercial or residential, so as to assure that the roofing is in accordance with the building code, such fee to be calculated as follows: seven dollars and fifty cents ($7.50) residential, ten dollars ($10.00) commercial. 
(4)	Drawings; contractor requirements: In the case of residential or commercial construction the contractor shall furnish drawings such that a determination can be made as to the square footage under construction and shall be required to show such receipts for utility connections as may be required by the city. Further, the contractor must be licensed in the city. It is understood that the square footage of the construction area used to determine the estimation of value will be calculated from drawings submitted by the contractor, and the city will have the option to increase the building permit fee if it is determined that the actual construction exceeds or varies in any extent from the blue print and drawing submitted for the original estimation. When the permit is issued, the city will have the right to issue a building inspection card to the contractor and to require the contractor to post such card in a visible location at the building site. The city will have the right to make any and all reasonable demands upon any contractor of a residential or commercial site which will reasonably assist the city in seeing that this chapter is in all respects complied with."

Cross reference- Flood hazard districts, App. A, § 2.5. 

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 5-70. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Alabama has in Title 11, Chapter 19, Sections 1-24, Chapter 45, Sections 1-1-1, Chapter 52, Sections 1-84, and Title 41, Chapter 9, Section 166 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of Citronelle Alabama, does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. 1237, art. 1, § A, 6-11-09) 
Sec. 5-71. - Findings of fact. 
(1)	The flood hazard areas of Citronelle, Alabama, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 1237, art. 1, § B, 6-11-09) 
Sec. 5-72. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(5)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(Ord. No. 1237, art. 1, § C, 6-11-09) 
Sec. 5-73. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)	To protect human life and health; 
(2)	To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)	To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)	To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)	To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)	To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)	To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 1237, art. 1, § D, 6-11-09) 
DIVISION 2. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 5-74. - Lands to which this article applies.

Sec. 5-75. - Basis for area of special flood hazard. 
    The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated April 13, 2009, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS and data for (*unincorporated county*) are hereby adopted by reference. Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. (*Identify specific areas here*.) 
(Ord. No. 1237, art. 2, § B, 6-11-09) 
Sec. 5-76. - Establishment of development permit.

Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the City of Citronelle or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 1237, art. 2, § G, 6-11-09) 
Sec. 5-81. - Penalties for violation.

(Ord. No. 1237, art. 2, § H, 6-11-09) 
Sec. 5-82. - Savings clause. 
    If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this article is for any reason held to be noncompliant with 44 Code of Federal Regulations 59-78, such decisions shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 1237, art. 2, § I, 6-11-09)

(c)	Any person aggrieved by the decision of the zoning board of adjustments may appeal such decision to the circuit court as provided by law. 
(d)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)	In reviewing such requests, the zoning board of adjustments shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(h)	Conditions for variances: 
(1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
(i)	A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
(iii)	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)	The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)	The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs/Office of Water Resources upon request. 
(i)	Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the zoning board of adjustments may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this article, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the start of construction commenced after June 11, 2009, and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure (i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for community participation in the (NFIP)) and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after June 11, 2009 (i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community). 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
a.	Built on a single chassis; 
b.	Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
c.	Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
d.	Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the structure before the damages occurred. 
    Section 1316. No new flood insurance shall be provided for any property which the administrator finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body, to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations or ordinances which are intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in floodprone areas. 
    Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the structure before the damages occurred. (Optional) 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the building should be: 
(a)	The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
(b)	In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
    For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: 
(a)	Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(b)	Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 44, § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) and corresponding parts of this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(Ord. No. 1237, art. 4, § B, 6-11-09) 
Sec. 5-90. - Floodways. 
(1)	Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-75, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(a)	The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point; 
(b)	Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the adopted regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
(c)	A community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of Section 65.12 [of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations], and receives the approval of the administrator. 
(d)	Require, until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. 
(e)	Only if subsection (b), (c) or (d), above are satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4. 
(Ord. No. 1237, art. 4, § C, 6-11-09) 
Sec. 5-91. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations (approximate A zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-75, where streams exist but no base flood data has been provided (approximate A zones), the following provisions apply: 
(1)	When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 5-75, then the building inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions of subsections (2) and (4) shall apply: 
(2)	No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty-five (25) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. (Optional.) 
(3)	All development in zone A must meet the requirements of section 5-88, and subsections 5-89(1) through (4). 
(4)	In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Also, in the absence of a base flood elevation, a manufactured home must also meet the elevation requirements of subsection 5-89(3)(b)(ii) in that the structure must be elevated to a maximum of sixty (60) inches (five (5) feet). (Optional) Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 5-88(4), elevated buildings. The building inspector shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(Ord. No. 1237, art. 4, § D, 6-11-09) 
Sec. 5-92. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-75, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)	All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 5-88(4), elevated buildings. The building inspector shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)	New construction and the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level or two (2) feet (if no map elevation is listed), above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsection 5-86(1)(c) and (2). 
(3)	Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

Sec. 10-20. - Duties of owner. 
    It shall be the duty of the owner of any real property located within the city to maintain property so that any nuisance is abated and prevented and maintain any grass or weeds growing upon said property in such a manner as not to constitute a nuisance. The duties and obligations of the owner extend to and include any real property situated within a dedicated right-of-way or easement burdening the property, except to the extent that it may be impracticable to do so because of public facilities located thereon. Such right-of-way and easements must be maintained by the owner in a manner consistent with the maintenance of the owner's remaining property and within the requirements in this article, except to the extent it may be impracticable to do because of public facilities located thereon. For purposes of this article, the duties and responsibilities of an "owner" should also apply to any tenant or other person or entity (corporate or otherwise) in control of the real property. Any enforcement officer shall have authority to cite any owner, tenant, or other person in control of the property, simultaneously or separately. 
    The dedication of and existence of a right-of-way for a public road or of an easement for drainage or for public utilities represents the grant of only a limited interest in property and does not change the actual ownership of the property upon which the right-of-way or easement is located. The public authority maintains rights-of-way and easements only to the extent necessary to maintain the public facility and to maintain safety. The owners of the burdened property continue to control the property, except to the extent that such control interferes with the public use. The public authority does not cut grass, weeds, and other growth upon rights-of-way or easements, except to the extent necessary for operations and safety purposes. All other maintenance is the responsibility of the owner of the property upon which the right-of-way or easement is located.

It shall be the responsibility of that person to promptly advise the enforcing official of any change in ownership or interest in the property. It shall be unlawful to knowingly fail to notify the enforcing official of any such change of ownership or interest. 
The notice shall require the owner to complete abatement of any nuisance within thirty (30) days from the date of notice, provided the enforcing official may stipulate additional time, but in no case more than a total of one hundred fifty (150) days. 
If an owner has been notified within the preceding twelve (12) months that the growth of grass or weeds violates this article, the enforcing official is authorized to give written notice to the owner to appear in court at a time and place to be fixed in the notice and then and there show cause why the growth of grass and weeds should not be declared a nuisance. The enforcing official is authorized to proceed to cut and remove the grass and weeds to the extent of the violation. 
(b)	Service. The notice provided for in subsection (a) shall be served upon the owner of the property or the person having charge of the property, as the case may be.

The enforcing official shall notify the owner by personal service or by first class mail of the determination of the municipal judge. If the municipal judge determines that a nuisance exists, the owner must comply with the initial order to abate issued by the enforcing official, with such modifications as may be made by the municipal judge. 
(d)	Abatement procedure. If the owner or person having charge of any premises whereon there exists a nuisance in violation of this article, shall fail to abate the same within the period prescribed in the notice or the five (5) days after the abatement thereof has been ordered by the municipal judge, the city shall enter upon the premises and at the expense of such person, shall proceed to abate the nuisance, and the officer in charge of the work is hereby directed to keep an account of the expense of abating the nuisance, and to certify the same monthly to the council.

(e)	Assessment of costs. At intervals to be determined by the city council, it shall cause to be made a list showing the names of the owners or persons who have in charge the premises from which nuisances have been removed or abated at the expense of such persons as hereinbefore provided, together with a description of the property from which the nuisance has been removed, and the statement of the amount of the expense (as reported by the officer overseeing the abatement) of removing the nuisance from each such piece of property. If the names of the owners of the property are not known, same may be stated as unknown. The council shall set a time and place when such persons may appear and show cause, if any they can, that the expense should not be assessed against them and their respective premises, and shall cause such notice to be published one (1) time in some newspaper published in the city, the publication to be made at least ten (10) days in advance of the date fixed for such hearing. At the time and place fixed for the hearing, the city council shall proceed to hear and determine any objections that may be interposed to such assessments and unless good cause shall be shown against the right of the city to assess the same, shall proceed to levy an assessment against the persons and their respective premises (from which the nuisance was abated) for the expense of such, and the assessment so made shall be final, and the city shall have a charge and claim against the owner or such persons and a lien on the property so assessed, for the amount of the respective assessments, which shall be filed in the office of the judge of probate of the county and recorded as other liens are recorded.

(Code 1962, § 718) 
Sec. 15-5. - Regulation of repair, servicing, operating, etc., oil and gas wells. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to drill in, repair, rework, produce oil or gas from or operate any well for oil and/or gas within the city limits, without first having fully complied with the following provisions and requirements: 
(1)	All such wells drilled, when being completed shall be equipped with an adequate master gate of standard manufacture, to be installed upon the casing of such well and such master gate to be maintained with proper fittings and valves as permanent equipment upon such well and to remain during the life and operation of the well. 
(2)	A suitable steel rod extension, not less than thirty (30) feet in length shall be securely fastened or attached to the stem of the master gate provided for in subsection (1) and the hand wheel for the operation of such master gate shall be securely fastened and remain in place on the end of such extension so that in the event of fire or other emergency, the master gate upon the casing may be operated at a distance of not less and at least thirty (30) feet from the casing head. 
(3)	A suitable master gate of standard manufacture shall be also installed upon the tubing to be placed in such well. 
(4)	All tubing installed in such well, or wells, shall be run or pulled through a suitable "blow-out preventer" of standard manufacture. 
(5)	All tubing shall be plugged while being run in the well. 
(6)	While the foregoing provisions apply expressly to the wells drilled and completed within the city limits after the effective date of the 1962 Code, it is the express purpose and provision of this section to ultimately require such protective measures to be installed upon all wells operating within the city; for which purpose, it is further provided that, should any person pull or remove the tubing now in place in any present producing well within the city, before doing so, such person shall give notice to the city clerk of such intention and secure a permit therefor; and thereupon, the foregoing subsections shall likewise apply to all present wells from and after the time the tubing may be pulled or removed from same; that when such tubing is pulled, the operator shall install the master gate upon the casing and tubing as provided in the foregoing subsections, together with the extension on the casing and master gate, and such rods shall be pulled through an adequate "blow-out preventer" of standard manufacture and said operator shall use some customary approved method of preventing the oil from flowing through the tubing in the withdrawal or installation of same. 
(7)	All pumping wells shall be equipped with a removable standard valve or tubing bleeder in order that the oil contained in the tubing above the standing valve can drain back into the hole rather than be brought to the surface. All rods shall be pulled through a rod wiper in order that the flow of oil through the tubing and around the rods may be restricted and prevented from spilling, overflow or escaping and thus form a fire hazard. Such rod wiper shall be in the nature of a blowout preventer for the rods on such equipment of standard manufacture as will prevent the oil from flowing between the rods and the tubing. 
(8)	All permits for the drilling and completion of future wells within the city as well as all permits for the reworking of wells and pulling of tubing on present producing wells within the city shall be in the nature of a separate ordinance and contract between such operator, as applicant, and the city. All such permits and individual ordinances shall contain the material provisions of this chapter, all of which shall be strictly complied with. 
(9)	The fire marshal of the city or other designated representative of the city shall have access to all wells now operating or to be hereafter drilled in the city for the purpose of inspecting same and to ensure full compliance with the terms and provisions of this chapter. In the event any owner or operator of present producing wells or future wells, should fail or refuse to strictly comply with the provisions of this chapter, the city council, at its discretion, may cancel any drilling or operating permits heretofore granted to such owner or operator and such well not equipped and operated as herein provided shall be closed and taken off production until compliance with all of the foregoing provisions. 
(10)	All pumping wells now located within the corporate limits of the city shall be enclosed in a substantial metal fence, of chain link construction, and of standard manufacture, and such fences shall be six (6) feet in height. The corner metal posts used for such fences shall have a two and one-half-inch inside dimension, and the metal posts used as line posts shall have a two-inch inside dimension, and the gate frames for such fences shall have a one-inch inside dimension. Where desired, a good grade line pipe may be used for such posts, provided, however, that such pipe shall be finished with at least one (1) undercoat of red lead and at least one (1) outcoat of aluminum paint, to be applied at the time of construction. Each fence shall be constructed with a tubular, galvanized iron railing, having a one-inch inside dimension, which shall be attached with the posts and shall be two (2) inches below the exposed upper edges of the posts. The galvanized fencing material used in such fences shall be of two-inch mesh and shall be constructed of not less than eleven (11) gauge wire. Such fences shall be completed with a galvanized metal gate of the same design and manufacture, which gate shall be kept locked with a substantial locking device except where access to the well is made under direction and authority of the owner of such well. All pumping wells drilled and completed in the future, within the corporate limits of the city, shall likewise be enclosed with a fence as above specified. This provision shall also apply to any equipment in operation at or in connection with any pumping well within the city where such pumping equipment is not actually located at the well.

Sec. 1.3. - Short title. 
    These regulations shall be known and may be cited as "The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Citronelle, Alabama." 
ARTICLE II. - ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS 

Sec. 2.1. - [Purpose.] 
    The City of Citronelle, Alabama, is hereby divided into zoning districts as listed and described below and as shown on the official zoning district map, for the purpose of: 
2.11 Providing a residential environment free of incompatible uses, safe from natural and man-made hazards; 
2.12 Promoting, where possible, planned residential, commercial, and industrial areas in appropriate locations, with appropriate standards and minimum service cost to local government; 
2.13 Providing a compact, convenient urban pattern for urban areas; 
2.14 Providing a level of flexibility of control sufficient to promote innovation and creativity in community development, to encourage maximum living comfort and convenience at lowest cost; and, 
2.15 Promoting the comprehensive plan for the city. 
Sec. 2.2. - Residential districts. 
2.21  R-1 Low Density Single-Family Residential District: This district is provided to afford opportunity for choice of low density suburban residential environment consisting of single-family homes on large parcels of land. 
2.22  R-2 Medium Density Residential District: This district is intended as a medium density single-family urban residential district and two (2) to four (4) family units to a building structure with lots of moderate size. 
2.23  R-3 High Density Residential District: The intent of this district is to provide opportunity, within a general protected residential environment, for the highest residential district density considered as appropriate to the environmental character of the city. Within this district it is also considered suitable to include other uses of a type considered not incompatible with a quality high density living environment and providing for needed community services. Public or community water and sewer facilities are required. 
2.24  R-4 Manufactured Home District: The intent of this district is to provide the opportunity for affordable dwelling units and to allow construction of single-family housing that is an alternative to "stick-built" homes. All manufactured homes, mobile homes, manufactured home developments, or manufactured home spaces, are limited to the "R-4 Manufactured Home" district, and no provision of the zoning regulations of the city should be construed otherwise. Such allowance shall be in accordance with the following considerations by the planning commission. Notwithstanding compatibility comparison requirements, nothing herein shall be considered or construed as a requirement that the commission allow manufactured homes, mobile homes, said developments, or said home spaces, in the said district. 
In order to qualify as a single-family residential dwelling, a manufactured home must be approved for compatibility by the planning commission. The manufactured home shall be compared to site-built and other housing in the immediate general area within the same district. A manufactured home shall be reviewed by the planning commission for compatibility standards set forth in this section. Approval shall be granted upon the finding that the manufactured home is substantially similar in size, siding material, roof material, foundation and general aesthetic appearance to existing development or proposed development in the same zoning district, and upon a finding that the approval does not materially affect the value of property or homes in the immediate or general area. 
(1)	Shape and appearance. The general shape and appearance of the manufactured home shall conform to housing in adjacent or nearby locations to ensure compatibility of site-built houses and manufactured housing. 
(2)	Roof pitch, roof overhang, roofing materials. The general shape and appearance of the roof of the manufactured home shall be compatible with the exterior appearance of the roofs of the housing in adjacent or nearby locations. Any roofing material may be used that will be compatible with other housing in adjacent or nearby areas. 
(3)	Exterior finish. Any material may be used for exterior finish that is generally used in areas near the location where the manufactured home is to be sited. 
(4)	Site orientation. Manufactured homes shall be placed on lots in a manner compatible with and reasonably similar in orientation to other structures in the area. 
(5)	Garages, carports. Garages and/or carports for manufactured home shall be compatible with the manufactured home and site-built garages and/or carports of site-built house in adjacent or nearby locations. 
(6)	Underpinning. The type of material and method used for underpinning shall be consistent with and compatible to the underpinning for site-built houses in adjacent or nearby locations. 
(7)	Electrical hook-ups. Electrical service may be supplied to a manufactured home by means of a service pole so long as the planning commission gives prior approval. In considering whether to grant approval, the planning commission will consider both the proposed location and the style and appearance of the service pole to assure compatibility with adjacent or nearby locations. 
(8)	The planning commission may consider the effect the manufactured home may have on the value of surrounding property, and surrounding homes in the general area. 
(Ord. No. 1192, § 1, 9-14-06) 
Sec. 2.3. - Business districts. 
2.31  B-1 Local Shopping District: This district is intended to provide for limited retail convenience goods and personal services establishments in residential neighborhoods and to encourage the concentration of these uses in one (1) location for each residential neighborhood rather than in scattered sites occupied by individual shops throughout a neighborhood. 
2.32  B-2 General Business District: This district is intended to provide opportunity for activities causing noise and heavy traffic, not considered compatible in the more restrictive business district. These uses also serve a regional as well as local market and require location in proximity to major transportation routes. Recreational vehicle parks, very light production and processing activities are included. 
Sec. 2.4. - Industrial districts. 
2.41  M-1 Light Industrial District: The purpose of this light industrial district is to provide a suitable protected environment for manufacturing, research and wholesale establishments which are clean, quiet and free of hazardous or objectionable emissions, and generate little industrial traffic. Industrial parks should be encouraged. Locations should be in accordance with comprehensive plans. 
2.42  M-2 General Industrial District: It is the intent of this district to provide opportunity for the location of industrial, manufacturing, processing, warehousing, or research and testing operations that, due to employment of heavy equipment or machinery or to the nature of the materials and processes employed, require special location and development safeguards to prevent pollution of the environment by noise, vibration, odors or other factors, and may also require extensive sites for storage and parking, may require extensive community facilities or generate heavy motor traffic. Access to major transportation facilities is usually needed. Locations should be in accordance with comprehensive plans and special review is required for some. 
Sec. 2.5. - Flood hazard districts. 
2.51  FH-1 Flood Hazard District: This designation places the boundaries of flood hazard district "FH-1" determined as specified in this ordinance hereunder, over all other districts. The boundaries of this district are shown on the flood insurance rate map, which is hereby incorporated for reference. It is the intent of this district to provide protection from the hazards and financial loss caused by flooding to the residents, businesses and industries and public uses of the community, and to protect sensitive natural environments that might be damaged by improper use of the floodway and floodway fringe. 
Cross reference- Flood insurance rate map, § 5-76. 
Sec. 2.6. - The official zoning map. 
2.61  Incorporation of the zoning map: The official zoning map, with all notations, references and other information shown thereon shall be the official zoning map and is hereby made a part of this ordinance. The official zoning map is hereby made a public record and shall be kept permanently in the office of the city clerk, where the map will be accessible to the general public. 
2.62  Identification of the official zoning map: The official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor, attested by the city clerk, signed and dated at the time of adoption of the ordinance. 
2.63  Map amendment: If, in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance, changes are made in the district boundaries or other information portrayed on the official zoning map, changes shall be made on the map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the city council. Unauthorized alterations of the official zoning map shall be considered a violation of this ordinance and subject to penalties as prescribed under "Penalties." 
ARTICLE III. - APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS 

Sec. 3.1. - Application of regulations. 
    Except as hereinafter provided: 
3.11  Use. No building, structure, or land shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in conformity with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located. 
Sec. 3.2. - Rules for determining boundaries. 
3.21 Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
(a)	Unless otherwise indicated, the district boundaries are indicated as approximately following property lines, land lot lines, center lines of streets, highways, alleys, shorelines of streams, reservoirs, or other bodies of water, or civil boundaries, and they shall be construed to follow such lines. 
(b)	Where district boundaries are approximately parallel to the center lines of streets, highways, or railroads, streams, reservoirs, or other bodies of water, or said lines extended, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance there from as indicated on the official zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the official zoning map. 
(c)	Where a district boundary line as appearing on the official zoning map divides a lot which is in single ownership at the time of this enactment, the use classification of a larger portion may be extended to the remainder by the council without recourse to amendment procedure. 
(d)	In case the exact location of a boundary cannot be determined by the foregoing methods, the board of adjustment shall upon application, determine the location of the boundary. 
3.22  Flood Hazard District: The boundaries of the flood hazard districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the flood insurance rate map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the rate map (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions), the board of adjustment shall make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires. 
Sec. 3.3. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood and erosion protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur. This ordinance does not imply that areas outside the flood hazard districts boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts shall be free from flooding flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
Cross reference- Similar provision, § 5-80. 
Sec. 3.4. - Nonconformance. 
3.41  Nonconforming building and uses: It is the intent of this ordinance to recognize that the elimination of existing buildings and structures or uses that are not in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance is as much a subject of health, safety and general welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses that would violate the provisions of this ordinance. It is also the intent of this ordinance to administer the elimination of nonconforming uses, buildings, and structures so as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established private property rights. Therefore, any structure or use of land existing at the time of the enactment of this ordinance, and amendments thereto, not in conformity with its use, regulations and provisions, may be continued subject to the following provisions: 
3.411  Unsafe structures: Any structure or portion thereof described unsafe by an authority may be restored to a safe condition, providing the requirements in this section are met.

(b)	Should a nonconforming building be moved, all nonconforming yard areas shall be eliminated. 
3.413  Extension: A nonconforming use of land shall be restricted to the lot occupied by such use as of the effective date of this ordinance. A nonconforming use of a building or buildings shall not be extended to include either additional buildings or land after the effective date of this ordinance. 
3.414  Restoration of damaged buildings : A nonconforming building, structure, or improvement, which is thereafter damaged or destroyed, may be restored. If, however, in the opinion of the building inspector [building official] [codes inspector], the restoration exceeds fifty (50) percent of the fair market value of the nonconforming structure, the matter will be referred to the planning commission prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
3.415  Change in use: A nonconforming use which is changed to a conforming use shall not be permitted to revert to the original or a less restrictive use. 
3.416  Discontinuance: A nonconforming use which becomes such after the adoption of this ordinance and which has been discontinued for a continuous period of six (6) months shall not be re-established and any future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. 
3.417  Adjacent land: The presence of a nonconforming use in a zoning district shall not be allowable as legal grounds for the granting of variances for other surrounding properties by the board of adjustment. 
3.418  Access to public streets: Access to public streets shall be maintained in accordance with the following requirements: 
(a)	Each principal use shall be placed on a lot or parcel which provides frontage on a public street having a right-of-way of not less than thirty (30) feet. 
(b)	Any additional dwelling shall have access to a public street by means of a passageway open to the sky at least fifteen (15) feet in width.

3.420  Land use: Where a lot, tract or parcel of land has an area or width that does not conform to the requirements of the district in which it is located, said lot may be used for a single-family dwelling except in the M-1 and M-2 Industrial Districts. A single-family dwelling may be constructed in an R-1, R-2 or R-3 Residential District, provided the lot to be so used has a minimum area of four thousand (4,000) square feet and a minimum lot width at the building line of forty (40) feet, provided it is located on a public sewer. 
3.421  Replatting: When two (2) or more adjoining and vacant lots with continuous frontage are in a single ownership at the time of application and such lots have a frontage or lot area less than is required by the use district in which they are located, such lots shall be platted or reparcelled so as to create one (1) or more lots which conform to the minimum frontage and area requirements of the use district. 
3.422  Improvements: Buildings or structures located on substandard lots of record may be improved only when the addition of adequate plumbing is required by the laws and ordinances of the city.

3.4233  Side yard requirements: The side yard requirements for substandard lots of record may be reduced for each side yard at the rate of one (1) foot for each four (4) foot by which the lot width lacks fifty (50) feet, provided in no event shall such side yard be reduced to less than five (5) feet on each side. 
3.4234  Front and side yard setbacks for dwellings: 
(a)	The setback requirements for side yards on corner lots and/or front yards shall not apply to any lot where the average setback on residentially developed lots located, wholly or in part, one hundred (100) feet on each side of such lot and within the same block and zoning district and fronting on the same streets as such lot, is less than the minimum required setback. In such cases, the setback on each lot may be less than the required setback, but not less than the average of the existing setbacks on the existing developed lots. 
(b)	On corner lots the front and side yard setbacks shall be determined by the proposed location of the structure on the lot. 
3.43  Nonconforming mobile homes: Nonconforming mobile homes existing in any zoning district prior to the adoption of this ordinance may remain. If the mobile home has to be moved in case of an emergency or is destroyed or damaged, said unit may be replaced or returned to its original location.

3.44  Special exemption: As regards establishing the location of setback lines for new construction in developed areas, the zoning officer shall have the authority to establish the location based on the average setback lines that are used by the existing structures on the same street and city block, without board of adjustment approval. A variance appeal to the board of adjustment may still be made if the zoning officer's decision is not satisfactory to the builder or if the zoning officer deems an application hearing is necessary. 
3.45  Setback lines-Location of street and road right-of-ways: For purposes of determining the location of setback lines for any new construction begun on or after the first day of September, 1996, and subject to the special exemption contained in Sec. 3.44, the following location of street and road right-of-ways shall be used:

4.88  Warning and disclaimer of liability: The degree of flood protection required by these regulations are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as bridge openings restricted by debris. These regulations do not imply that areas outside the flood hazard area boundaries or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. These regulations shall not create liability or flood damages. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the City of Citronelle or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on the regulations or any decision lawfully made thereunder.

Sec. 8. - Procedure. 
    Classification of subdivisions: The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision by the planning commission ultimately results in the approval and recording of a final plat of the subdivision. The procedure consists of basically one (1) step for a minor subdivision and two (2) steps for a major subdivision: 
(1)	Minor subdivision: 
a.	Presentation and approval of the preliminary plat (optional). 
b.	Presentation, approval, and recording of the final plat. 
(2)	Major subdivision: 
a.	Presentation and approval of the preliminary plat (optional). 
b.	Presentation and approval of the engineering plan. 
c.	Presentation, approval, and recording of the final plat. 
(a)	Preliminary plat: The preliminary plat is intended to be a relatively simple "sketch" or "drawing" of the proposed subdivision, submitted so that the subdivider may begin the approval process by meeting with and discussing the feasibility of the proposal with the planning commission prior to incurring engineering and surveying costs. 
(1)	Preparation: The preliminary plat must contain at least the following; 
a.	Location Map. A diagram showing the location and ownership of the land proposed to be subdivided, noting the location of all adjoining property, its ownership and the nature of its improvements, and the location and name of all existing public streets providing direct access to the land proposed to be subdivided. A diagram showing the proposed subdivision, the location and size of all lots, the location and proposed names of all streets, the location, size and nature of any intended building, the location, size, and proposed use of any lot or other piece of land not intended for building, and the location, size, and nature of all easements. 
b.	Certificates. A certificate signed by the chief of police of the city stating that the proposed plat is acceptable with regard to considerations of public safety and traffic flow and containing any suggestions or comments the chief deems appropriate. A certificate signed by the director of South Alabama Utilities stating that the proposed plan provides adequately for the delivery of water, sewer, and gas and stating whether these utilities are planned for immediate or future delivery, and containing any suggestions or comments the inspector deems appropriate. 
(2)	Presentation for approval. The subdivider shall present three (3) copies of the preliminary plat and accompanying documents at a regular meeting of the planning commission, and shall be present either personally or through a representative in order to discuss, answer questions, and explain the submission. As noted above, the requirements stated for preparation of the preliminary plat are minimal requirements. The more detailed the preliminary plat, then the more likely it is that the planning commission will fully understand and appreciate the proposal at the first regular meeting at which it is presented. In the event that the planning commission needs further information in order to properly consider the preliminary plat, then it may reject the presentation until the further information is provided, and may consider the preliminary plat as being presented at the meeting at which the additional information is provided. The planning commission shall act on the preliminary plat at the meeting at which it is presented, either by granting approval as submitted or with changes required by the planning commission that shall become a part of the preliminary plat, or by disapproving the preliminary plat. The action of the planning commission shall be reduced to writing and mailed to the subdivider at the address given by the subdivider for delivery of the notice. The notice shall contain a statement of any required changes that have become a part of the preliminary plat, or a statement of the planning commission's reasons in the event of a disapproval. The failure of the planning commission to act on the preliminary plat at the meeting at which it is presented shall be an approval of the preliminary plat. However, the planning commission may carry over the consideration of the preliminary plat to a date set for a special meeting or until the next regular meeting, whichever is nearer in time, but in no event for more than thirty (30) days. The consideration of the preliminary plat may be carried over in this manner only one (1) time. In the event that there is not a quorum present at the regular meeting at which the preliminary plat is first presented, then consideration of the preliminary plat shall be carried over in the same manner as previously provided. In the event that the preliminary plat is disapproved, then the planning commission shall state its reasons on the record. The presentation of a preliminary plat is not a submission of a plat with the meaning of section 11-52-32 of the Code of Alabama. 
(b)	Engineering plan: The engineering plan is intended to be a detailed presentation covering the engineering plans for the construction of all streets and improvements. 
(1)	Preparation: The engineering plan must contain at least the following:

c.	Utilities. The location, size, and invert elevations of existing and proposed sanitary sewerage and water lines, providing at a minimum for the immediate construction of those portions of sanitary sewerage or water lines that will be beneath the subdivision street, the location and results of soil percolation tests if individual sewage disposal systems are proposed, and any other data on utilities that may be necessary to allow completion of the installations. 
d.	Other improvements. Data sufficient for the construction or installation of any other proposed improvements, and in the case of buildings, including residences, a copy of all protective covenants and building restrictions.

S. Corps of Engineers, etc. 
(2)	Presentation for approval: Three (3) copies of the engineering plan and accompanying documents shall be submitted to the city clerk who shall make it available for review by members of the planning commission, and who shall place it on the agenda for presentation at the regular meeting that is scheduled at least two (2) weeks from its submission to the city clerk. As noted above, the requirements stated for preparation of the engineering plan, then the more likely it is that the planning commission will fully understand and appreciate the proposal at the first regular meeting at which it is presented. In the event that the planning commission needs further information in order to properly consider the engineering plan, then it may reject the presentation until the further information is provided, and may consider the engineering plan as being presented at the meeting at which the additional information is provided. Following presentation, the planning commission shall act on the engineering plan in the same manner as required for action following the presentation of the preliminary plan. The presentation of an engineering plan is not a submission of a plat within the meaning of section 11-52-32 of the Code of Alabama. 
(c)	Final Plat: The final plat is the document that, when recorded, completes the subdivision process. The final plat must be completed in strict conformity with these regulations, and shall provide an accurate record of street and property lines and other elements being established on the land and the conditions of their use.

Sec. 13. - Variances. 
13.1	Variances: Variances, modifications and waivers may be granted under the following conditions: 
13.1.1	Hardship - Where the planning commission finds that extraordinary hardship may result from strict compliance with these regulations due to unusual topographic or other conditions beyond the control of the subdivider, it may vary the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the interest secured; provided, however, that such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the purpose and intent of the regulations, the zoning ordinance or the comprehensive plan. Any variance granted must be entered upon the minutes and the reason for the variance specified therein. 
13.1.2	Experimental subdivisions - The planning commission may waive, vary or modify the standards and requirements of these regulations if, in its judgment, an unusual or experimental subdivision might prove of considerable merit toward: 
a.	The use of unusual materials in constructing required improvements, or: 
b.	A new or untried concept in the area which appears promising. 
13.1.3	Sale or exchange - The sale or exchange between or among owners of adjoining lots is exempt from these regulations provided that no new lots are thereby created and that no lot is reduced below the minimum size otherwise required by the provisions herein or by provisions of the zoning ordinance. 
13.2	Conditions: In granting variances and modifications provided herein, the commission may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure the objectives and interest of the city. 
Sec. 14. - Minimum design standards and required improvements. 
14.1	Suitability of land: The planning commission shall not approve the subdivision of land if, from adequate investigations conducted by all public agencies concerned, it has been determined that in the best interest of the public the site is not suitable for platting and development purposes of the kind proposed. The design and improvements of all subdivisions and developments shall meet all state and county health department requirements and proof thereof shall be submitted. 
14.2	Land subject to flooding: Land subject to flooding or inadequately served by drainage facilities will not be acceptable for subdivision unless the subdivider agrees to make such improvements as will render the land fit for occupancy in conformity with the national flood insurance program. Fill may not be used to raise land in areas subject to flood and/or excessive erosion, unless the fill proposed does not restrict the natural flow of water, advance erosion, and unduly increase flood heights. 
14.2.1	To insure proper development in flood-prone areas, the commission shall require the subdivider to provide elevation and flood profiles sufficient to demonstrate that the sites will be free from the danger of flooding. 
14.2.2	If a stream flows through or adjacent to the proposed subdivision, the plat shall provide for an easement or right-of-way along the stream for a floodway. For the smaller streams, the plat shall also provide for channel improvement to enable them to carry all reasonable floods within banks. The floor elevations of houses shall be high enough to be above the regulatory flood. The floodway easement shall be wide enough to provide for future enlargement of the stream channel as adjacent areas become more highly developed and runoff rates are increased. 
14.2.3	Approval will not be given for streets within a subdivision which would be subject to excessive inundation or flooding. 
14.3	Conformance with existing plans: Proposed improvements in all subdivision developments within the Citronelle planning jurisdiction shall be in conformance with existing approved plans, maps, ordinances, and design standards of the City of Citronelle and/or the Citronelle planning commission. 
14.4	Planned unit developments: A comprehensive group development including the large scale construction of housing units together with necessary drives and ways of access, may be approved by the planning commission although the design of the project does not include standard width of streets, lots and other subdivision arrangements if the departure from the required standards contained herein can be made without destroying their intent. A master plan for such comprehensive group development shall be submitted to the commission for approval, provided that approval of the master plan shall not constitute approval of individual plats for phased development of the master plan over a period of years. 
14.5	Streets: All proposed streets in any subdivision or PUD, including apartments, townhouses, condominiums, patio homes, etc., whether such streets shall be private or dedicated for public use, shall be paved and adequately drained. This requirement is not subject to modification by the planning commission. The subdivider shall construct streets in the subdivision in conformance with good engineering practices to the standards prescribed herein or by the state or county highway department, whichever is more restrictive. The planning commission may require the posting of a maintenance bond on all street improvements for a period of two (2) years. This bond shall be in an amount equal to ten (10) percent of the total street improvements in the subdivision or of specified street improvements in the subdivision.

14.6	Blocks. Blocks shall be arranged to assure maximum use of the topographic features of the land. 
14.6.1	Blocks shall not be less than four hundred (400) feet nor more than twelve hundred (1200) feet in length, except as the planning commission considers necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired features of street patterns. In blocks over eight hundred (800) feet in length, the planning commission may require one or more public cross walks of not less than ten (10) feet in width to extend entirely across the block at locations deemed necessary. 
14.6.2	Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two (2) tiers of lots of minimum depth, except where fronting on major streets, limited access highways, railroads or where prevented by topographical conditions or size of the property, in which case the planning commission will approve a single tier of lots of minimum depth. 
14.7	Lots. The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be such as the planning commission deems appropriate for the type of development and use contemplated and shall properly relate to the topography of the land and character of the surrounding development. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. Each lot must front upon an existing or proposed street or road which has a right-of-way not less than fifty (50) feet in width. 
14.7.1	Where central water and sanitary sewer systems are reasonably accessible, the subdivider shall connect to such systems and provide connections to each lot.

14.7.2	Size of properties reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. Platting of individual lots should be avoided in favor of an overall design of the land to be used for such purposes. 
14.8	Other requirements. Due consideration shall be given to the allocation of areas suitably located and of adequate size for playgrounds, parks for local or neighborhood use and other public service areas. In all subdivisions due regard shall be shown for all natural features such as large trees, water courses, historical spots, and similar community assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the property. 
14.8.1	In subdivisions of fifty (50) or more lots or twenty (20) or more acres in size, the subdivider shall provide suitable recreation land of at least five (5) percent of the total area of land to be subdivided. In the event the subdivision is to be developed in sections, appropriate agreement shall be made with the planning commission to assure the dedication of the required land. 
14.8.2	Where public sites have been set aside within an element of the Citronelle community development plan or when such features are recommended as essential by the local governing body or planning commission, such sites shall be reserved in written agreement by the subdivision for acquisition by the proper public body by purchase or other means for a period of one (1) year from the date of the recording of the subdivision after which if the acquisition has not been accomplished, the reservation shall become null and void. 
14.8.3	Reserve strips and/or easements controlling the access to streets shall be prohibited except where this control is definitely placed in the hands of the city under conditions approved by the planning commission. 
14.8.4	Easements having a minimum width of ten (10) feet and located along the side or rear lot lines shall be provided as is necessary for utility lines and underground mains and cables. Where subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream there shall be provided a stormwater or drainage right-of-way of adequate width to accommodate normal runoff. 
14.8.5	Whether it is provided by means of open ditches, closed storm drains, or curbs and gutters, the subdivision shall have an adequate stormwater collection system. 
Storm sewers and drainage structures shall be designed and installed as required in accordance with good engineering practice. The minimum pipe diameter of storm drains shall be fifteen (15) inches. In no case shall stormwater empty into the sanitary sewer system. 
Where a storm sewer system is reasonably accessible to the subdivision, the subdivider shall connect with such network and install all drainage structures necessary to convey the water to the storm drainage system. 
Where a storm drainage system is not accessible, the subdivider shall install all drainage structures necessary to convey the water to a location acceptable to the city. All open drainage ditches shall either be paved with a material acceptable to the city or be designed and stabilized in a manner acceptable to the city engineer. 
14.8.6	Water, sewer and gas utilities shall be installed underground in the street right-of-way by the subdivider before any street base is applied unless special conditions require otherwise. 
14.8.6.1	Water mains for both domestic use and fire protection shall be properly connected with a central water system or with an alternate water supply approved by the county health officer. The line shall be constructed in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots shown on the subdivision plat. 
Where a public water supply is within reasonable distance of the subdivision, as determined by the planning commission, the subdivider shall connect with same. The design and specifications of the distribution system shall meet the city water system requirements. If a well is required for each lot, the location, construction, and use of such well shall also meet the county health department requirements. If a well is to serve more than one lot, a public water system shall be required. The design and specifications of such distribution system shall meet the county health department specifications, and shall be installed under inspection of the utilities department. 
Fire hydrants shall be installed along each street at a maximum interval of six hundred (600) feet, or at the ends and center of each block. The water supply and pressure shall be sufficient to provide adequate fire protection as well as the future needs of the intended land use. 
14.8.6.2	A public sanitary sewer system shall be installed when the cost of installing such a system does not exceed two hundred (200) percent of the cost of installing individual septic tanks on all lots in the subdivision. Where lots cannot be economically connected with a sewerage system, they must contain adequate area for the installation of septic tank and disposal fields as approved by the county health officer. 
Where a public sanitary sewer system is not available, and a private system is installed, it shall be constructed in accordance with requirements of a public system and with appropriate permits from the Alabama department of environmental management. If septic tanks are installed, special approval must be obtained from the county health department. Lot size shall not be less than the minimum standard and of satisfactory size for the proper installation of a septic tank sewage system as indicated by percolation tests. 
14.8.6.3	When gas mains and/or electric lines are connected with central distribution systems, the lines shall be installed in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots shown on the subdivision plats. 
14.8.7	Street lighting shall be installed at all intersections. If additional lighting consistent with safety and other community needs is deemed necessary, the planning commission may require the subdivider to present a street lighting plan developed in conjunction with the utility company having jurisdiction within the area. 
14.8.8	Appropriate permanent type street name signs shall be placed at all intersections within the subdivision. The developer may select signs which will be in keeping with the theme of the development subject to approval of the building inspector. 
14.8.9	Right-of-way and property line monuments shall be placed in each subdivision. 
14.8.9.1	Concrete monuments three and one-half (3 1/2) inches square and two (2) feet long shall be driven flush with the grade at the intersection of all street rights-of-way and radius points. 
14.8.9.2	Iron pins one-half (1/2) inch in diameter and two (2) feet long shall be driven flush with the grade at each lot corner and at each point where the property line changes direction. 
14.9	Inspection of improvements. The subdivider is required to install or construct the improvements herein described prior to having released the bond or other surety which guarantees installation of such required improvements. All improvements required shall be constructed in accordance with the standards set forth in these regulations, or as required by the building inspector or his duly authorized representative, the state or county highway department, and the department of the respective utility. 
All water mains, sanitary sewers and laterals, and storm sewers shall be installed as necessary to prevent the future cutting of the pavement of any street, sidewalk, or other required pavement. 
When all required improvements are installed, the subdivider shall call for a final inspection. The building inspector or his duly authorized representative shall inspect the site to determine if the required improvements are satisfactorily installed according to the plans and specifications. To determine if the streets are installed to minimum design standards, the city shall select an independent testing laboratory to make the necessary tests. These tests shall be conducted at the expense of the subdivider. 
Sec. 15. - Adoption of amendments. 
    The adoption of any amendment to these subdivision regulations shall be by resolution of the planning commission carried by the affirmative votes of a majority of the members of the commission.
