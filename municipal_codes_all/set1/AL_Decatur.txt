PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Decatur, Alabama of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1956 Code, as supplemented through June 5, 1978, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1956 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 4 is numbered 4-1 and the third section of Chapter 9 is 9-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-1 and 4-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-1.1, 4-1.2 and 4-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 3 and 4, it will be designated as Chapter 3.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Milton E. Lefkoff, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. A. J. Coleman, Corporate Counsel, and Mr. Herman H. Marks, Jr., City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

Licenses issued under this chapter may not be assigned or transferred without prior consent of the city subject to the provisions of this chapter. The city is hereby authorized to allow the address for the licensed premises to be changed from one place to another within the city, as the city may determine appropriate; but shall not allow the transaction of business at a place for which the license could not originally have been issued lawfully. 
(b)  In the event of a change of ownership of a licensed establishment, the current licensee shall be required to file a written statement with the revenue department indicating this occurrence prior to either completing the sale of the licensed business, or relinquishing management or financial control of the business operation, whichever occurs first; and additionally, the party to whom the licensed establishment is to be sold must file with the city a complete application for an alcoholic beverage license within twenty (20) days of notification to the city of the intent to sale, transfer, or assign the establishment. Upon request of the revenue department, any applicant may be requested to produce records of the business or the transaction surrounding the sale of the business to determine the parties involved or the effective date of the transaction. These records include, but are not limited to, lease agreements, land sale agreements, bank statements, stock transfers, minutes of corporate board meetings, and/or purchase invoices. Any failure to produce the requested records, or a determination by the city that the transaction is not in compliance with the requirements specified herein will result in an immediate forfeiture of the city alcoholic beverage license upon notification of this determination and an opportunity for public hearing by the city council. 
(c)  Licenses issued by the city shall be deemed to expire, terminate, or otherwise be void when there is a substantial change in ownership in a licensed establishment, or when a licensed establishment is leased, rented, or abandoned, or when possession is otherwise surrendered to another party or parties. Provided, however, that an applicant for a new license at a currently licensed establishment may be allowed to operate the establishment for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days if said applicant is in compliance with subparagraph (b) of this section.

In the event the temporary closing is due to any renovation, remodeling, or repair to the licensed premises, the licensee shall provide written evidence of compliance with applicable building, fire, and health codes to the revenue department prior to the release of the license. 
(e)  For the purposes of this section, and to assist in defining a substantial change in ownership, the sale or transfer of twenty-five (25) percent or more of a corporation's stock shall constitute a substantial change in ownership of the licensee.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 00-3610, § 1, adopted June 19, 2000, amended the Code by adding a new chapter to read as herein set out. The ordinance included sections to be numbered 2.6-15 and 2.6-16.

Sec. 2.6-1. - Purpose. 
    Whereas, sexually oriented businesses in the incorporated area of a city require special supervision from public safety and health agencies of the city in order to protect and preserve the health, safety and welfare of the patrons of such businesses and the citizens of the city; and 
    Whereas, from review of other city studies and surveys and testimony from citizens, there is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both existing businesses and the surrounding residential areas, causing among other adverse secondary effects, increased crime and downgrading of property values; and 
    Whereas, it is recognized that sexually oriented businesses, due to their nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, thereby contributing to crime, lower property values, urban blight and downgrading of the quality of life in the adjacent area; and 
    Whereas, the city council finds that sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaison of a casual nature; and 
    Whereas, increased crime and unhealthy conduct tend to accompany, concentrate around and be aggravated by sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to prostitution, pandering, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession and distribution of obscene materials and child pornography, possession and sale of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons and property; and 
    Whereas, concern over sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS, is a legitimate health concern of the city which demands regulations of sexually oriented businesses in order to protect the health and well being of the citizens; and 
    Whereas, the city recognizes the possible harmful effects on children and minors exposed to the effects of such businesses and the resulting deterioration of respect for family values; and 
    Whereas, the city recognizes the importance of the avoidance of such businesses, which confront children walking through or visiting in the immediate neighborhood of such business; and 
    Whereas, the city council finds that there would be a deterioration in the quality of businesses which choose to operate in and around such sexually oriented businesses; and 
    Whereas, the city council desires to minimize and control these adverse secondary effects and thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and businesses; deter the spread of urban blight and protect against the threat to health from the spread of communicable and social diseases; 
    Therefore, the city council hereby declares it to be the purpose and intent of this chapter to support and uphold the Alabama Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1989 (section 13A-12-200.1 et seq.) Code of Alabama, 1975 as amended by legislation and court proceedings and to establish community standards and regulate materials and actions that are deemed harmful to the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city.

Sec. 4-40. - Requirements. 
(a)  Prior to the adoption of an animal from the animal shelter the city approved adoption agreement must be completed. The director or his representative has the right to deny the request to adopt an animal if he or she feels that the person is unable to provide a suitable home to care for the animal properly and prevent it from becoming a nuisance. 
(b)  Upon approval to adopt an animal from the animal shelter, the required adoption agreement must be signed. Failure to agree to the terms of the adoption agreement shall be grounds for disqualification of that person to adopt an animal. 
(c)  All dogs and cats which are adopted through the animal shelter shall be surgically altered to prevent reproduction of that animal, before the animal can go home with its adopter. The fee for spaying or neutering animals will be collected according to the fee schedule set by the director or shelter manager. This fee is in addition to the established adoption fee and any rabies vaccination fee. The animals will be transported by Decatur Animal Services Personnel to and from a local veterinarian for sterilization and rabies vaccination. 
(d)  An adoption fee will be collected according to the fee schedule set by the director or shelter manager. In addition to the adoption fee, if a dog or cat is not currently vaccinated, the adopting person shall pay a fee for the rabies vaccination according to the fee schedule set by the director or shelter manager. The issuance of the receipt from the Decatur Animal Services for the payment of the fees shall serve as proof of payment for the veterinarian's knowledge. The adopting person shall present the animal and the receipt to a veterinarian within 45 days for the rabies vaccination, or the receipt becomes null and void. 
(e)  The director or shelter manager has the right to waive the adoption fee for a legitimate 501(c)(3) rescue organization that has veterinarian references, and that fills out any required forms to be filed and maintained at the shelter. If the animal has not been spayed or neutered, there will be a fee charged for the sterilization of said animal according to the fee schedule set by the director or shelter manager; and also a fee will be charged for a rabies vaccination before the animal will be released to the rescue organization. After an animal is placed on the adoption floor it must remain there thirty (30) days before it is eligible to be removed for the use of a legitimate rescue organization.

Chapter 6.5 - BINGO OPERATIONS 

Sec. 6.5-1. - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter, unless the context requires otherwise, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
    Bingo. The game of bingo is a game of chance that is played by groups of people seated in a duly authorized and permitted location. Balls bearing a combination of one (1) of five (5) letters (B-I-N-G-O) and a number between one (1) and seventy-five (75) are randomly drawn, usually from a wheel, and announced by a "caller." The game is played on flat pieces of cardboard or disposable paper containing twenty-five (25) squares arranged in five (5) vertical columns and five (5) horizontal rows (i.e., a five-inch by five-inch square matrix). The letters B-I-N-G-O are printed above the five (5) vertical columns, with one (1) letter appearing above each column; the center space on the square matrix may be marked "Free," and one (1) of the seventy-five (75) numbers with which the game typically is played is pre-printed in each of the remaining twenty-four (24) squares. The distribution of the seventy-five (75) numbers commonly corresponds to the following arrangement on the pre-printed card: 1 to 15 in the "B" column; 16 to 30 in the "I" column; 31 to 45 in the "N" column; 46 to 60 in the "G" column; and, 61 to 75 in the "O" column. As balls are randomly drawn and the marked letter/number combination announced by the caller, each player covers (with a poker chip, "daub" of paint, or some other marking device) any square on his or her Bingo card that corresponds to the announced letter/number combination. Players compete against each other to be the first to achieve a specified winning pattern (typically, five (5) contiguous squares covered vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) announced by the caller before the beginning of each game, and a winner is required to call out the word "Bingo!" to alert other players and the caller to a possible win. Bingo cards are not cleared and a new game begun until it has been confirmed that each space covered on the putative winner's card was, in fact, randomly drawn and announced by the caller during the course of that game. This definition may not be construed to include the operation of the game of bingo by the use of any electronic or electrical equipment or device, computer, or related equipment, telecommunication or data transmission, storage, or receiving equipment. 
    Bingo session. A series of consecutive games held during a period of time not to exceed five (5) hours in a given day, not to extend beyond the hour of 11:30 o'clock p.m., nor to exceed one (1) day in a calendar week, with the exclusion of Sunday. Games will be considered to be consecutive when they are continuous except for a break of no more than fifteen (15) minutes between games. 
    Committee. The bingo review committee. 
    Equivalent value. The fair market value of the gift on the date the gift is given as the prize in a bingo game. 
    Location. A single building, hall, enclosure, or outdoor area used for the purpose of playing bingo pursuant to a permit or license issued under this chapter. Multiple permits may not be issued for the same location. 
    Net proceeds. The gross proceeds of each bingo session less the cost of prizes and the cost of purchase and/or repair of bingo machines and monitors. In addition to the cost of prizes and the purchase and/or repair of bingo machines and monitors, the actual specific expenses incurred as a reasonable expense of each bingo session for bingo game sheets, janitorial services, security, bookkeeping or accounting services, trash pick-up (dumpster) services, insurance, utilities, return check fees and license fees which are directly related to the operation of the bingo session may be deducted from gross proceeds to determine net proceeds. Said additional expenses must be directly related to the operation of bingo sessions and the deduction for such additional expenses may not during a calendar year exceed, in aggregate, seven (7) percent of the gross proceeds of all bingo sessions during that particular calendar year. 
    Permit. A permit issued by the city clerk pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Said permit is in addition to, and not in lieu of any business or privilege license which may be required by the city's licensing code. 
    Permit holder. A qualified organization or qualified club which holds a current permit or license pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
    Person. Any human being, corporation, association or other legal entity. 
    Reasonable expenses. Includes customary and usual business overhead expenses. 
    Qualified organization. A bona fide religious, educational, service, senior citizens, fraternal or veteran's organization which, by its charter, certificate of incorporation or constitution, operates without profit to its members and which qualifies as an exempt organization under Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, provided that the principal location of each such organization (defined as being where a majority of the organization's assets are located) shall have been in existence continuously as that organization within that area of the corporate limits of the city which lie within Morgan County for a period of three (3) years and which has owned or leased real property within the city limits which lie within Morgan County for at least three (3) years immediately prior to making application for a bingo permit.

Chapter 9.5 - EMERGENCY ALARM SYSTEMS 

Sec. 9.5-1. - Purpose. 
(a)  It is declared to be the public policy of the city to prevent and discourage the incidence of false alarms to the greatest extent possible. This public policy declaration is in recognition of the fact that due to their frequency, false alarms endanger the lives of the citizens and emergency service personnel to an even greater degree than the incidence of actual emergencies. 
(b)  In addition to the hazards presented by emergency travel, the allocation of police personnel, fire personnel and equipment to a false alarm removes these resources from service, thus endangering lives and property in the event of an actual police or fire emergency. Experience has proven that the number of valid alarms is very low, while the services provided to alarm owners is frequent. The expectation that the alarm may be false is high, creating an extremely dangerous condition for police and fire personnel and an apathetic response by the public when the alarms are heard or otherwise encountered. 
(c)  For the foregoing reasons it is the policy of the city that limited police and fire resources must be maintained and monitored in a manner that insures that false alarms will be kept to an absolute minimum. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish requirements for the use of emergency alarm systems to summon the police and fire personnel in the city so as to achieve this goal. 
(Ord. No. 00-3587, § 1, 3-6-00)

    False security alarm. The activation of any alarm not caused by fire, forced entry, attempted forced entry, robbery or other crime which results in an official response of the police and/or fire departments and which is caused by the negligent use or misuse of the system by the owner or his employees or servants. A presumption exists that the alarm was false if the police or fire personnel responding to the alarm find no evidence of criminal activity, attempted criminal activity, fire or other emergency at the premises. 
    Fee. The assessment of a monetary charge payable to the city pursuant to this section. 
    Generated revenue. Any revenue collected from fees, permits or other fees derived from alarm sources. These fees will be placed in a fund and used for the enforcement and maintenance of any section of this chapter.

In the absence of the specific assignment of responsibility for the alarm, the person or persons occupying and/or controlling the premises on which the alarm is located will be held liable; however, if the false alarm occurs in an apartment building or other multi-family structure, the responsibility shall lie with the manager or owner of the premises and not the tenants. 
(b)  When responding to an alarm, false or otherwise, at which there is no persons on the premises, a police department official or fire department official will contact the authorized representative(s) who shall respond to the premises within thirty (30) minutes for the purpose of conducting a security check of the premises and resetting the alarm system.

During the month of January following the initial licensing the licensee will provide the actual gross receipts of the business, vocation, occupation or profession to the city for the preceding year. In addition to licensing for the then current year, the actual gross receipts and corresponding license amount for the preceding year will be compared to the initial estimate or projection of gross receipts and its corresponding license amount which was paid and the current year license will be adjusted to reflect any difference whether that be in the form of a reduction or increase to the current year license. 
Gross receipts, for a business, vocation, occupation or profession not maintaining a physical place of business or the facilities to conduct business within the corporate limits or its police jurisdiction shall mean only the entire receipts from sales or services rendered to its customers within the corporate limits and police jurisdiction.

Said notice shall give the date, time and place of the hearing before the city council, and the licensee shall be given the opportunity at such time and place to be heard, and may appear and may have the benefit of counsel. If the licensee fails to appear either in person or through his attorney, the suspension or revocation shall be made final by the city council, and if such licensee shall appear by himself or through his counsel, or both, the city council shall proceed to hear evidence which may be presented for and against such suspension or revocation. Said council may, in its discretion, either continue the hearing for good cause shown, or may enter an order making the suspension or revocation final or may permit the licensee to retain his license so long as he does not violate any penal law of the state or of the city. Whenever a license is suspended or revoked and the suspension or revocation is made final by the city council, written notice of such action shall be given by the city clerk to said licensee.

(b)  Mere delivery of the taxpayer's merchandise by common carrier shall not allow the municipality to assess a business license tax against the taxpayer, but the gross receipts derived from any sale and delivery accomplished by means of a common carrier shall be counted against the seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) limitation described in the preceding section if the taxpayer also during the same license year sells and delivers into the taxing jurisdiction using a delivery vehicle other than a common carrier. 
(c)  A common carrier, contract carrier, or similar delivery service making deliveries on behalf of others shall not be entitled to purchase a delivery license. 
(d)  The delivery license shall be calculated in arrears, based on the related gross receipts during the preceding license year.

(f)  Unless revoked sooner, permits issued pursuant to this division shall be valid for the dates and times specified on the application, provided, however, no permit issued hereunder shall be valid for more than a consecutive twelve-month period of time.

(2)  The solicitor conducts solicitation activities in violation of any provision of this article. 
(b)  Action against master. 
(1)  Should more than one (1) complaint be received that solicitors for any one (1) master solicitor have violated any of the provisions of this article; the city clerk-treasurer may suspend or revoke all solicitor permits for such master solicitor and notify the permit holders of such action. 
(2)  Should more than one (1) complaint be received that solicitors who are soliciting under a master permit have violated any of the provisions of this article, the city clerk-treasurer may suspend or revoke the master permit and notify the master solicitor, which shall have the effect of revoking all the solicitor's permits issued under the master permit without the need of further action by the city or notification of each solicitor. 
(3)  Upon any action being taken to suspend or revoke a master permit, all solicitor's permits issued under the master permit shall be included in such action and the right to appeal the action shall be solely that of the master solicitor. 
(c)  Upon revocation or suspension, the city clerk-treasurer shall immediately provide written notice to the permit holder stating the action and the reasons supporting such action.

(d)  The city clerk treasurer shall have the authority to seize any and all permits and photo identification tags possessed by persons conducting business as a solicitor while the official notification process and any appeals process is underway if the basis for the action is the existence or occurrence of a disqualifying factor or if the chief of police finds that there is an immediate threat to the public health or safety if the soliciting is allowed to continue. Upon seizure of the permit and tag all solicitation activities conducted under the authority of that permit shall cease.

Sec. 18-23. - Design guidelines. 
    The following guidelines are the Secretary of the Interior's "Standards for Rehabilitation" and should serve as general guidelines for the district and should be consistently followed by the historic preservation commission if possible. 
(1)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose. 
(2)  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. 
(3)  All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged. 
(4)  Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
(5)  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
(6)  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
(7)  The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken. 
(8)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to any project. 
(9)  Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood or environment. 
(10)  Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired. (Ord. No. 90-2882A, § 6, 2-5-90) 
Cross reference- Guidelines and criteria for certificates of appropriateness, § 18-86.

Expedited review procedures shall waive the requirements for submission of an application for a certificate of appropriateness and for consideration at a public meeting. (Ord. No. 90-2882A, § 7, 2-5-90) 
Sec. 18-25. - Determination of economic hardship. 
(a)  Each application for removal or demolition shall be considered, taking into account economic hardship. The commission may solicit expert testimony or require that, at the expense of the applicant, submissions be made concerning any or all of the following information before it makes a determination on the application: 
(1)  Estimate of the cost of the proposed redevelopment, alteration, demolition, or removal and an estimate of any additional cost that would be incurred to comply with the recommendations of the commission for changes necessary for the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness.

(4)  In the case of a proposed demolition, an estimate from an architect, developer, real estate consultant, appraiser, or other real estate professional experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of the existing structure on the property. 
(b)  The commission shall review all of the evidence and information required from applicant and make a determination within thirty (30) days of receipt of application whether the denial of a certificate of appropriateness has deprived, or will deprive, the owner of the property of reasonable use of, or economic return on, the property. Reasonable return shall be considered an annual return of a minimum of six (6) percent of the value of the property. This percentage has been established as a reasonable rate of return on properties where economic hardship has been litigated before the United States Supreme Court. The commission may extend the review process an additional thirty (30) days if so desired. Written notice of the determination shall be provided to the owner and the owner shall have the right of appeal to the city council within fifteen (15) days from date of written notification.

(1)  Upon every person who is the occupant of a dwelling unit containing usual and ordinary kitchen facilities, other than apartments and multifamily dwellings classified as business establishments by section 19-1 of this chapter, the sum of sixteen dollars and fifty cents ($16.50) per month per dwelling unit; and upon every person operating a business establishment as designated by the public works director or designee pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the sum of thirty-six dollars and ninety-six cents ($36.96) per month per business establishment. Each dwelling unit using more than the base number of two (2) containers (one (1) for garbage and one (1) for leaves, grass, and shrubbery trimmings) shall be charged seven dollars and forty-three cents ($7.43) per month for each additional container used. This charge shall be paid in the same manner as the base service fee is paid. Each dwelling unit or approved business establishment receiving residential collection or other collection of garbage, trash, rubbish and other refuse by the city using an alley, except for a townhouse dwelling served by a concrete alley, shall be charged the additional sum of five dollars ($5.00) per month to be paid in the same manner as the base service fee. 
Effective October 1, 2015, and each subsequent October 1 thereafter each of the above listed fees will increase or be adjusted annually in an amount equal to the CPI trailing twelve-month index as of June 30 of that current year. Where electric service is furnished to a dwelling unit or business establishment by the electric department, the terms "occupant" and "person operating" shall be taken to refer it to the person in whose name such service is subscribed, regardless of whether or not such person resides in such dwelling unit or operates such business establishment. 
(2)  The above provision notwithstanding, any occupant who can show documentation to the city that the occupant's household has as its sole source of income only social security benefits shall be exempt from the payment of the monthly service fee for that dwelling unit. In order to continue to pay no monthly service fee, the occupant must at least every twelve (12) months present to the city the documentation described immediately above. It shall be the responsibility of the occupant to make sure that the documentation is presented timely or otherwise the provisions of subparagraph (1) shall apply to such occupant. 
(3)  If a dwelling unit containing usual and ordinary kitchen facilities, other than apartments and multifamily dwellings classified as business establishments by section 19-1 of this chapter, remains vacant for sixty (60) consecutive days, the occupant as defined above may file with Decatur Utilities a sworn statement stating that the dwelling unit has been vacant for sixty (60) consecutive days and that the dwelling unit has not generated any garbage, trash, rubbish, and other refuse for sixty (60) consecutive days. The statement should also state that the occupant agrees that once the dwelling unit is occupied, Decatur Utilities will be notified immediately. After receipt of the required sworn statement by Decatur Utilities, there shall be no monthly service fee charged to the occupant for that dwelling unit for the next succeeding month and each month thereafter until such time as the dwelling unit is occupied; and then accordingly the provisions of subparagraph (1) above shall apply. 
(c)  All bills for service shall be rendered monthly on the same statement rendered by the electric department for electric service. Each bill shall be due when rendered and shall become delinquent if not paid within ten (10) days thereafter. If any such bill shall not be paid within five (5) days after it becomes delinquent, the furnishing of refuse service shall thereupon be discontinued to the dwelling or business establishment with respect to which such bill is so delinquent. The above service fee is net, the gross being ten (10) percent higher. In the event the current monthly bill is not paid within ten (10) days from the date of bill, the gross fee shall apply. The electric department is hereby designated as the agent for collection of said refuse fees, and said department shall remit the same to the city clerk periodically as they are collected. Provided however, that where the person liable for the fees prescribed has no electric service furnished to him by said department such shall be paid to the office of the city clerk on a quarterly basis, such quarterly payments to be an advance deposit for the service to be rendered for the succeeding three-month period, such payments to become due and payable on the first day of October, January, April and July of each year and shall be delinquent after the tenth day of each such month. Where service is instituted within the quarterly period, such payment and deposit shall be prorated for the partial quarter. 
Failure to pay the charges herein provided shall constitute a violation of this chapter and shall be unlawful. 
(d)  The public works director or designee is authorized, in his discretion, to include within the residential service provided under this chapter those business establishments located on normal residential pickup routes, provided such establishments do not generate more than two (2) cubic yards of refuse per week. In no wise shall the business establishment be issued more than two (2) carts for garbage and refuse collection. In the event of such authorization, the person operating such establishment shall pay the business establishment rate as provided above and in the manner prescribed above. Any such authorization shall be revocable by the public works director or by the city.

The minimum commercial rate for businesses without dumpster is seven dollars ($7.00) per month. Additional charges of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) are to be billed for extra pickups beyond scheduled service. 
(2)  The superintendent of sanitation shall determine the size container and the number of pickups per week needed for each business establishment in order to keep the premises clear and sanitary, and to handle all refuse generated by such business establishment upon which the monthly charge shall be based. Any person aggrieved by the determination of service needed by the superintendent of sanitation shall have the right to appeal to the council, or to a committee which may be established by the council for the purpose of hearing such appeals, by filing with the city clerk a written application requesting resurvey of the refuse generated by such establishment and the service needed. Upon receipt of such application, it shall be the duty of the superintendent of sanitation to promptly resurvey the premises and report his findings to the council or designated committee. The council, or the designated committee established for such purpose, may make such adjustments as it may determine from the evidence shall be necessary, provided however, that no refund or extra charge shall be made for the month in which said application is filed. The superintendent of sanitation shall have the right at any time to recheck and resurvey any premises, and to reduce or increase the size container needed and the number of pickups required for the following months according to the volume of refuse found to be produced or accumulated upon said premises. Where electric service is furnished to a business establishment by the electric department, the user of refuse service shall be taken to refer to the person in whose name such service is subscribed, regardless of whether or not such person actually owns or operates such business establishment. 
(3)  The superintendent of sanitation is authorized to allow, in specific instances, the sharing of containers by groups of business establishments, where in his judgment, such promotes economy and does not impede the performance of service provided for in this chapter. In the event of such container sharing, the superintendent of sanitation shall fix and determine the proportion of the aforesaid service fee due to be paid by each such participating business establishment, which sum shall be billed and collected as provided in this chapter. Except as otherwise provided in this section, containers furnished by the city shall be used only by the business establishment designated for use thereof. 
(c)  All bills for service shall be rendered monthly on the same statement rendered by the electric department for electric service. Each bill shall be due and rendered and shall become delinquent if not paid within ten (10) days thereafter. If any such bill shall not be paid within five (5) days after it becomes delinquent, the furnishing of both electric service and refuse service shall thereupon be discontinued to the business establishment with respect to which such bill is so delinquent. The above service fee is net, the gross being ten (10) percent higher. In the event the current monthly bill is not paid within ten (10) days from date of bill, the gross fee shall apply. 
    The electric department is hereby designated as the agent for collection of said refuse fees, and said department shall remit the same to the city clerk periodically as they are collected. Provided however, that where the person liable for the fees prescribed has no electric service furnished to him by said department, such shall be paid to the office of the city clerk on a quarterly basis, such quarterly payments to be an advance deposit for the service rendered for the succeeding three (3) month period, said payments to come due and payable on the first day of October, January, April and July of each year, and shall be delinquent on the tenth day of each such month. When service is instituted within the quarterly period, such payment and deposit shall be prorated for the partial quarter.

Sec. 19.5-7. - Discharge prohibitions. 
    No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any material, including, but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. 
(1)  Exceptions to illegal discharge prohibition. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited, except for the discharges described as follows: 
a.  Water line flushing or other potable water sources; 
b.  Landscape irrigation or lawn watering; 
c.  Diverted stream flows; 
d.  Rising ground water; 
e.  Ground water infiltration to storm drains; 
f.  Uncontaminated pumped ground water; 
g.  Foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems);

(3)  The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made prior to the date this chapter was adopted, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4 or allows such a connection to continue beyond the date of enactment of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 05-3824, § 1, 4-18-05) 
Sec. 19.5-8. - Suspension of MS4 access. 
(a)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The city engineer may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent or substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city engineer may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(b)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city engineer will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city engineer for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if, without the prior approval of the city engineer, the person reinstates MS4 access to premises to which access has been terminated pursuant to this chapter.

Sec. 19.5-9. - Industrial or construction activity discharges. 
    Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the city engineer prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(Ord. No. 05-3824, § 1, 4-18-05) 
Sec. 19.5-10. - Monitoring of discharges. 
(a)  Applicability. This chapter applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity related thereto. 
(b)  Access to facilities. 
(1)  The city engineer shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance herewith. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the city engineer. 
(2)  Facility operators shall allow the city engineer ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
(3)  The city engineer shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city engineer to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
(4)  The city engineer has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the city engineer and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
(6)  Unreasonable delay in allowing the city engineer access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the city engineer reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter. 
(7)  If the city engineer has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the city engineer may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

Sec. 19.5-11. - Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices. 
    The city will adopt requirements identifying BMPs for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide and bear the expense of reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise which the city engineer determines to be the source of an illicit discharge may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this chapter. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(Ord. No. 05-3824, § 1, 4-18-05) 
Sec. 19.5-12. - Watercourse protection. 
    Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(Ord. No. 05-3824, § 1, 4-18-05) 
Sec. 19.5-13. - Notification of spills. 
    Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person who is responsible for a facility or operation or who is responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which the city engineer determines to be causing or which may cause illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system or waters of the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the city engineer in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city engineer within three (3) business days of the original notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials originates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator or such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3) years. 
(Ord. No. 05-3824, § 1, 4-18-05)

(Ord. No. 05-3824, § 1, 4-18-05) 
Sec. 19.5-18. - Injunctive relief. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 23-111. - Purpose and policy. 
    This article sets forth uniform requirements for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Decatur. This article regulates all direct and indirect contributors of non-domestic wastewater into the wastewater collection and treatment system owned by the city and operated by the municipal utilities board of the city (the board); enables the board to ensure compliance with all applicable state and federal laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR, Parts 401 et seq., including amendments) and includes, pursuant to those authorities and the laws of the state, the establishment of local limits and controls to address impacts to the wastewater collection and treatment system, provide for its safe and effective operation, and prevent pass through of pollutants or interference with the treatment system which could potentially impact human health, safety, welfare, and the environment. 
    This article authorizes the board and general manager to regulate persons or owners who are direct and indirect contributors of non-domestic wastewater to the board's wastewater system, referred to as "contributors" or "users" of the wastewater collection and treatment system. Regulation is provided through the written authorization of certain non-domestic users through permits, contracts, or other appropriate mechanisms, and through enforcement of and compliance with general and specific requirements for users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires user reporting, sampling and analysis, establishes administrative review procedures, assumes that existing customer's lawful capacity will not be preempted except as provided in this article, provides for maximum strength and load of contributions, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein. 
    This article shall apply to all users both within and outside the city limits who discharge or contribute to the board's wastewater collection and treatment system. Any user that discharges wastewater into the board's wastewater system, shall comply with the terms and conditions established in this article, as well as any permits, orders or other conditions issued hereunder. Except as otherwise provided herein, the general manager of the board or his designees shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article. Any powers granted to or duties imposed upon the general manager may be delegated by the general manager to other board personnel. 
    Except as specifically provided in this article, this article is not applicable to discharges of wastewater comprised solely of human excrement and/or household gray water.

(2)  Alternative grease removal system. In certain cases, the installation of the required size outdoor FOG interceptor may be impractical due to limited space or other factors. A FSF may request a variance by submitting a proposed alternative grease removal system. The general manager, upon request, may review an alternative grease removal system as proposed by the FSF for attaining FOG protection for the sewer system. For an alternative grease removal system to be considered, the FSF must first demonstrate that the proposed alternative system, its overall design, including size and location, will satisfy and result in compliance with the intent and discharge requirements of the wastewater ordinance. The design plans must be signed and sealed by an Alabama licensed professional engineer with experience in interceptor design to effectively remove grit, oil, sand and/or FOG as required. The proposed alternative grease removal system must be approved by the general manager. If approved, the design professional must certify that the site plan and the alternative grease removal system design meets the intent and discharge requirements of this wastewater ordinance and shall meet the provisions of the duly adopted Code of Decatur, Alabama, chapter 7, article IV, Code sections 7-71 to 7-120. 
(3)  For facilities other than eating establishments. All grit, oil and sand interceptors used in conjunction with facilities other than eating establishments shall have a capacity that will provide not less than ten (10) minutes nor more than thirty (30) minutes retention time at the peak eight (8) hour flow rate. Flow-through velocities shall not exceed one (1) foot per second at the peak eight (8) hour flow rate. 
All grit, oil and sand interceptors shall be of a sufficient size to handle the specified loading for the intended use and cleaned and inspected regularly and shall meet all discharge requirements as specified in the wastewater ordinance and the provisions of the duly adopted Code of Decatur, Alabama, chapter 7, article IV, Code sections 7-71 to 7-120 where such parameters have not been otherwise set forth herein. 
(c)  Maintenance. 
(1)  All grit, oil, sand and FOG interceptors shall be maintained by the user/FSF at their expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times. 
(2)  In the maintaining of these interceptors, the user/FSF shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material, and shall maintain records of the dates, and means of disposal which are subject to review by the general manager. The frequency of removal shall be such as to ensure that no overflow of grit, oil, sand and/or FOG enters the wastewater system. 
(d)  Proper disposal of collected materials. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by the user/FSF employees must be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms. Under no circumstances shall the collected materials be returned to the wastewater system.

Secs. 23-135.3-23-135.10. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - PRETREATMENT PROCEDURES (PERMITTING, COMPLIANCE TRACKING, AND ENFORCEMENT) 

Sec. 23-135.11. - General. 
    It shall be unlawful for any user, discharger or contributor subject to this article to discharge to the board's wastewater collection or treatment system without a wastewater discharge permit, authorization, and/or contract as provided herein, except as authorized by the city in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 08-3954, § 1, 7-7-08) 
Sec. 23-135.12. - Pretreatment and user program. 
    The board's pretreatment program consists of four (4) major elements: 
(1)  The identification and categorization of dischargers into user groupings, below, and determination of pretreatment requirements; 
(2)  The issuance of permits or other authorization for discharge, including contracts as specified in this article; 
(3)  The tracking of dischargers to ensure compliance; and 
(4)  The enforcement of this article. 
The purpose of this division 3 is to describe the procedures for meeting the requirements of the four (4) areas listed above. The intent of these procedures is to establish the administrative mechanism to allow the efficient and effective implementation of the board's non-domestic sewer use ordinance to meet the purposes set forth in section 23-111. 
(Ord. No. 08-3954, § 1, 7-7-08) 
Sec. 23-135.13. - Identification and categorization of users and determinations of requirements. 
(a)  Identification of users and dischargers. All dischargers of non-domestic waste are subject to this article and must be reviewed to evaluate applicability of pertinent requirements. 
(1)  Existing users, dischargers, or contributors. The primary tool for identifying existing dischargers who may be subject to the board's pretreatment requirements is a preliminary screening questionnaire (industrial wastewater survey) and accompanying letter of transmittal. All existing dischargers will be required to respond to the industrial wastewater survey and provide the information specified. The industrial wastewater survey questionnaire and letter will be sent to any known or suspected discharger for which the board and general manager do not have sufficient information on file to implement the provisions of this article. The industrial wastewater survey differs for each category of discharger set forth below. The function of the questionnaire is to obtain sufficient information to determine what further action will be required to categorize the discharger and establish appropriate authorization pursuant to the provisions of this article. 
Should there be no response from the recipient to the questionnaire, a second questionnaire will be sent with a letter of transmittal detailing the eventual consequence of non-response. Should the second questionnaire elicit no response, the name of the discharger will be referred for follow-up under enforcement procedures. 
(2)  New users, dischargers, or contributors. New dischargers making application to discharge to the wastewater collection and treatment system of the board shall complete the industrial wastewater survey and permit application. The function of the questionnaire is to obtain sufficient information for the board to determine appropriate authorization pursuant to the provisions of this non-domestic sewer use ordinance. 
(3)  The industrial wastewater survey may include any information as provided in Ala. Admin. Code r. 335-6-5-.13, information characterizing such waste or wastewaters that is available to or has been provided to the user or proposed user, and any such other information as is necessary to develop the appropriate permit or other authorization and necessary conditions and limitations at the discretion of the general manager. Where any user or proposed user fails to provide complete, accurate and truthful information to the general manager, board, or its representatives or agents, sewer service shall be denied, and/or any permit, contract or other authorization for that user shall be terminated, suspended, or revoked. 
(b)  Categorization. Upon receipt of the required information, each user will be placed into one of the following categories for program management. Categorization will be made in as fair and equitable manner as possible. General guidelines for identifying category placement are given below. 
    Category 1: Those users which have no discharge other than normal sanitary wastewater, or whose non-sanitary discharge has no significant effect on the board's wastewater collection and treatment system, shall be placed in this category. The businesses so designated will be maintained in the board's inventory in case a change in status is required in the future. For those businesses designated category 1, no permit, authorization, or contractual arrangement between the board and user will be required, except by designation by the general manager as provided below. 
    Category 2I: Users with wastewater discharges that do not fall under state or federal industrial pretreatment guidelines or the provisions of 40 C.F.R. Part 401 et seq.; and therefore, are not required to obtain a permit from said agencies. However, businesses, with discharges that contain some constituent of concern to the board, or whose discharge may have the potential to pass through or interfere with the operation and maintenance of the board's wastewater collection and treatment system will be subject to control by the board and general manager. Following receipt of complete information as required by this article, the general manager will make a determination regarding the issuance of a permit or other authorization delineating specific requirements for the discharge. Where appropriate, a permit or other authorization will be issued by the board through the general manager for users designated category 2I. In addition, the user will be subject to the board's compliance tracking program. 
    Category 2FS: Users that prepare and/or serve food commercially and are not required to obtain a state indirect discharge (SID) permit are placed in category 2FS. A business so categorized will be subject to the board's compliance tracking program and monitored for oil/grease and any other constituents that, in the general manager's judgment, may pass through or interfere with the operation and maintenance of the board's wastewater collection and treatment system. Following receipt of complete information as required by this article, the general manager will make a determination regarding the issuance of a permit or other authorization delineating specific requirements for the user. Where appropriate, a permit or other authorization will be issued by the board through the general manager for dischargers designated category 2FS. 
    Category 3: Users that are subject to state and federal industrial pretreatment rules and regulations and are required to obtain a SID permit will be placed in this category. Generally, in accordance with state requirements, a business discharging a wastewater with one or more of the following characteristics will be placed in category 3: 
a.  The discharge of more than 25,000 GPD of process wastewater; 
b.  The discharge in significant quantities of one or more of the EPA designated categories of wastes or wastewaters set forth in the categorical pretreatment standards; 
c.  The discharge in significant quantities of a prohibited or potentially prohibited waste or wastewater. 
Users in this category must obtain permit authorization under division 3, subsection 23-135.14. of this article and comply with this article, any federal, state or local requirements including permits issued pursuant to those authorities, and must comply with all requirements of 40 C.F.R. Part 401 et seq. users in this category will be subject to the board's compliance tracking program. Following receipt of complete information as required by this article, the general manager will make a determination regarding the issuance of a permit or other authorization delineating specific requirements for each discharger in this category. Where appropriate, a permit or other authorization will be issued by the board through the general manager for users designated category 3. Where necessary to achieve the purposes of this article, category 3 users may be required to enter into a contract for discharge. 
    Category 3A: Users with high strength wastewater, or that treat or recover hazardous or non-hazardous industrial metal-bearing waste, oily waste, and organic-bearing waste from off-site, or any user with high strength wastewater. 
a.  EPA has determined that users that treat or recover hazardous or non-hazardous industrial metal-bearing waste, oily waste, and organic-bearing waste from off-site discharge wastewater which may contain very high pollutant concentrations and are unusually difficult to treat and should be recognized as a separate category. EPA has established the combined waste treatment (CWT) point source category for such users and determined that few facilities in the CWT industry achieve optimum pollutant removals. 
b.  The board has determined that the wastewater collection and treatment system may not be able to accommodate all users discharging high strength wastewater or CWT wastewater or all volumes of such discharges. 
c.  Authorization of discharges for this category requires additional analysis and may require additional conditions to ensure that such users do not over utilize or otherwise adversely affect the board's collection and treatment system capacity. Category 3A users are required to provide information regarding waste streams, wastewater quality, wastewater quantity, source of wastewater, treatment facilities and removal and treatment efficiencies, and other information necessary to properly assess the potential discharge and affect on the board's wastewater collection and treatment system and establish appropriate conditions or limitations for a permit or other authorization. Any user which meets the definition of CWT at 40 C.F.R. Part 437, treats or recovers any hazardous or non-hazardous industrial metal-bearing waste, oily waste, and organic-bearing waste from off-site, or any user that discharges or proposes to discharge high strength wastewater is subject to the requirements for category 3 and 3A. 
d.  High strength wastewater is defined as: 
Parameter Concentration or Load Constituting High Strength Wastewater 2 pH Greater than 9.0 BOD 5 Greater than 1000 mg/l or 4,000 lb/day COD Greater than 1,000 mg/l or 8,000 lb/day TSS Greater than 3,000 mg/l Oil and grease Greater than 100 mg/l TKN Greater than 60 mg/l Ammonia Greater than 200 mg/l Phosphorus Greater than 20 mg/l Sulfates Greater than 800 mg/l Chlorides Greater than 1,000 mg/l Chlorine demand Greater than 15 mg/l Molybdenum Greater than 1 mg/l Total toxic organics Greater than 5 mg/l  
2 Daily maximum values. 
Any user with at least one discharge exceeding one or more of the concentrations set forth above, or proposing to discharge wastewater exceeding one or more of the concentrations set forth above, is deemed a user with high strength wastewater and subject to category 3 and 3A. 
e.  Following receipt of complete information as required by this article, the general manager will make a determination regarding the issuance of a permit or other authorization delineating specific requirements for each user in this category. Where appropriate, a permit or other authorization will be issued by the board through the general manager for users designated category 3 and 3A. 
f.  The issuance of a permit, authorization and/or contract to users designated category 3A is at the sole discretion of the general manager. A permit, authorization, and/or contract issued to a category 3A user is revocable at any time for cause. Cause includes but is not limited to non-compliance, lack of plant capacity existing or contemplated in the future, failure to remit surcharges or fees, or such other cause as is determined by the general manager. 
    Category 4: All other discharges. users who are determined to not meet the criteria of any of the other categories are deemed category 4. Following receipt of complete information as required by this article, the general manager will make a determination regarding the issuance of a permit or other authorization delineating specific requirements for each user in this category. Where appropriate, a permit will be issued by the board through the general manager for users designated category 4. 
Designation by the general manager: The general manager may determine on a case-by-case that any user requires permit or other authorization pursuant to this article based upon the quantity, quality, rate, or characteristics of an existing or proposed discharge to the board's wastewater collection and treatment system. Upon the general manager's designation, such user will be required to apply for and obtain permit authorization to discharge. Failure to make application and obtain authorization may result in suspension, termination, or revocation of sewer service. 
(Ord. No. 08-3954, § 1, 7-7-08) 
Sec. 23.135.14. - Permits, authorizations and contracts. 
    The basis for regulating discharges from category 3, 3A, and where necessary and appropriate category 2I, 2FS and 4 to the board's wastewater collection and treatment system will be through permits, authorization letters, or contracts between the user and the board. SID permits will be issued and enforced by ADEM but are not directly controlled by the board, however, the general manager may incorporate by reference SID permits or their limits or conditions into a permit, authorization, or contract. The general manager may establish local limits which shall be incorporated into SID permits for users in accordance with the procedures established by ADEM and EPA pursuant to the federal pretreatment regulations. 
    Where the board or general manager determines that a contract is necessary or appropriate to meet the purposes of this article, the board will execute contracts with users. These contracts will specifically identify all pretreatment requirements to be enforced by the board that the user must meet and will provide the board and general manager with authority to require the user to comply with all provisions of this article including all federal, state and other provisions incorporated by reference. Users may be subject to other state and federal or local pretreatment or other requirements not included in the board's contract. 
    Should a user be required to construct a pretreatment facility to meet the purposes of this article, such a requirement and a schedule for completion of such facility will be included as an enforceable portion of the user's permit, authorization, or contract. Failure to meet such requirement and schedule is grounds for termination of a contract, injunction, damages, or such other remedies as provided by law, and, where it may constitute a violation of this article, enforcement, injunction, or other relief. 
(1)  Application. 
a.  Application information.

A minimum of one hundred eight (180) days prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit, the user shall apply for renewal of the contract. The terms and conditions of the contract may be subject to modification by the board during the term of the contract as limitations or requirements as identified in division 2 are modified or other just cause exists. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his permit at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a time schedule for compliance. 
(4)  Transfer. Permits, authorizations and contracts are issued to a specific user for a specific operation and discharge. A wastewater discharge permit, authorization or contract shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed operation without the express written approval of the board. users must notify the general manager of a change in ownership (e.g. transfer of ownership, assets, acquisition) in writing and may be required to resubmit application information. Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of the existing contract until such time as board has issued a new permit, authorization or contract to the succeeding owner or user. 
(5)  Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the board that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. 
When so requested by the person furnishing a report and upon justification of such claim, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the NPDES, the SID and/or pretreatment programs or as otherwise required by law; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other factual information provided by any user regarding wastewater or its impact the wastewater collection and treatment system will not be recognized as confidential information. 
The board shall not transmit to any governmental agency or to the general public information accepted by the board as confidential, until and unless a ten-day notification is given to the user or as otherwise provided by law. 
(6)  Monitoring facilities. Category 2I, 3 and 3A users shall provide and operate, at the user's own expense, all required monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage system and any monitoring facilities as may be required pursuant to a permit, authorization, or contract. The monitoring facility shall normally be situated in the user's premises, but the board may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area with the required, appropriate permission from the city and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. The monitoring facility shall normally be situated in the right-of-way or easement area. Upon a determination by the general manager, category 2FS and 4 users may be required to provide monitoring facilities as specified in this subsection at their own expense. 
(7)  Inspection and sampling. The board may inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the user is complying with all requirements and the purpose of this article is being met. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the board or its representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. The board and the approval authority shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the board, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(8)  Determination of pretreatment requirements, conditions, and other limitations. After the user is placed in one of the categories previously described, requirements for category 2I, 3, 3A, and 4 users must be determined. The general manager will make such determinations considering the information provided by the user or proposed user, or other information which may be available to the board. If available, the determination will consider actual data from analysis of plant influent and effluent, sludge analysis, and the characteristics of the water body receiving the plant effluent; pollutant loadings from all significant industrial discharges and best professional judgment based on literature search and/or EPA published estimates. Where appropriate the determination will be made in coordination with ADEM. Effluent limits for priority/categorical pollutants will be in accordance with those promulgated by EPA and ADEM, unless more stringent or additional limits and/or conditions, management and operational practices are necessary to protect the board's wastewater collection and treatment system, to prevent pass through, interference, or otherwise satisfy the purposes of this article. 
(Ord. No. 08-3954, § 1, 7-7-08) 
Sec. 23-135.15. - Appeal procedures for requirements, conditions, and other limitations. 
    Determinations concerning pretreatment requirements, conditions, and other limitations for the use of the board's wastewater collection and treatment system, permits or other authorizations issued to users, or other determinations or actions under this article will be made by the general manager of the system. Should the user or proposed user object to the general manager's determination regarding pretreatment requirements, conditions, and other limitations, or any person be aggrieved by a determination under this article, the procedures listed below are applicable: 
(1)  Written notice of the objection and appeal and the reasons therefore must be made to the general manager of the board within thirty (30) calendar days of notification of the requirement. The notice of objection and appeal must identify with reasonable specificity the requirement, condition, or limitation that is the source of the objection, any facts relevant to the disposition of the written notice of objection and appeal, facts believed to be in error in the general manager's determination, all applicable legal or regulatory provisions, and any proposed alternative requirement, condition, or other limitation. The general manager will reply to the objection within thirty (30) calendar days. The general manager may reply in a manner provided under this article. Where insufficient information has been provided to the general manager by the entity providing notification under this subsection, the general manager may request that additional information be provided within five (5) days. Failure of such entity to provide adequate information is cause for dismissal of the appeal. Decisions by the general manager may be appealed to the board, or to a committee that the board for the purpose of hearing such appeals may establish. Decisions by the board are final except in cases where ADEM must also concur. 
(2)  Any written appeal submitted and received by the board, which is not addressed within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt, or set for hearing, is considered granted to the user or entity filing such appeal except where the general manager has, upon review of the written appeal, determined that additional information is necessary and has made a written request for additional information. 
(3)  The thirty-day period within which the user or proposed user can appeal may be waived by the general manager if extenuating circumstances so justify. 
(4)  The user or proposed user submitting written notice of objection and appeal will be given the time, date and place of the hearing, and may present said objection in his behalf at said hearing. 
(5)  The board may conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may designate any of its members or any officer or employee to: 
a.  Issue in the name of the board notices of hearings requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings; 
b.  Take the evidence; 
c.  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the board for action thereof. 
(6)  At any hearing held pursuant to this article, testimony taken may be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof. 
(7)  After the board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user or proposed user upholding the general manager's determination; requiring additional requirements, conditions or limitations; directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate devices or other related appurtenances are installed on existing treatment facilities, and such devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated and maintained, ordering any payments of surcharges, fees, or other amounts as provided in this article, or requiring any action as provided in this article. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued. 
(8)  Failure to timely file a written notice of objection and appeal, or failure to comply with these appeal procedures, constitutes a waiver of any right to appeal or otherwise contest or seek review of the permit, authorization, contract to discharge, or any other determination or action under this article. 
(9)  In the case of a permit or authorization for a new user, or an existing user seeking increased volume, concentration, loading or frequency of discharge or other change from normal operations, the permit or authorization shall be stayed pending appeal, provided however that upon petition filed by a user or proposed user, the board may temporarily allow discharge under the conditions set forth in the permit or authorization under appeal during the pendency of the appeal. The following actions shall not be stayed by appeal: suspensions, terminations, or revocations, temporary authorizations, letter or order establishing conditions and limitations to address non-compliance, harm or potential harm to the wastewater collection and treatment system; or suspensions, terminations, or revocations, temporary authorizations, letter or order establishing conditions and limitations to address pass through or interference with the POTW. 
(10)  This subsection does not limit any legal procedures applicable to the establishment of requirements, conditions, or limitations otherwise provided by law. 
(Ord. No. 08-3954, § 1, 7-7-08) 
Sec. 23-135.16. - Modification of program requirements for users. 
    Periodically, changes in requirements, conditions or limitations of existing users may be appropriate. When such changes are deemed necessary, the procedures listed below are applicable: 
(1)  The users will be notified in writing of the proposed change and of the basis for the change. 
(2)  Included in the notice of change will be any draft permit or contractual requirements, if appropriate. 
(3)  The proposed change in user requirements will be effective thirty (30) days after notice. Should a user object to the change, such objection must be registered with the board as provided in subsection 23-135.15 above within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice of proposed change. 
(4)  The filing of a request by the user for a permit modification does not stay any condition of its existing contractual agreement. 
(Ord. No. 08-3954, § 1, 7-7-08) 
Sec. 23-135.17. - Compliance and reporting program. 
    The purpose of the compliance and reporting program is to insure all category 2I, 2FS, 3, 3A, and as appropriate category 4, users are meeting the terms of their permits, authorizations, and/or contracts for the protection of the wastewater treatment system, human health, safety and the environment. There are four major components of the compliance and reporting program: 
(1)  Self monitoring reports. 
a.  Self-monitoring reports are required for users in category 2I, 3, 3A, and as appropriate category 2FS and 4. Self-monitoring reports shall contain information necessary to determine compliance with conditions and limitations of the user's permit, authorization or condition. Reports may include the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass, where requested by the board or general manager, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards or this article. The frequency of monitoring and reporting shall be prescribed in the permit, authorization, or contract and will reflect applicable pretreatment standard, other wastewater discharge permit and/or as otherwise prescribed by the approval authority. Copies of self-monitoring reports and all information and documents utilized for their preparation, including laboratory analyses, bench sheets, and quality assurance/quality control information must be kept by the user for a period of five (5) years. 
b.  All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the approval authority pursuant to section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the approval authority. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the approval authority. 
c.  Discharge monitoring reports. Users who are required to submit a self-monitoring (DMR) report, either monthly or quarterly, to ADEM as designated in their SID permit must submit a copy of the DMR report to the general manager so that it is received no later than the twenty-eighth day following the monitoring period covered. 
d.  Category 2FS users are not required to submit a monthly, self-monitoring report unless required to do so by the board. 
e.  Any other user may be required to submit self-monitoring reports in a frequency established by the general manager and containing such information as the general manager or board may deem necessary and appropriate. Reporting frequency and parameters may be set forth in any permit, authorization, or contract. 
f.  Failure to submit such report will be a breach of the executed contract and could result in enforcement action. 
(2)  Compliance evaluation inspections. All users are subject to compliance evaluation inspections (CEI). The purpose of CEIs is to insure compliance with applicable conditions and limitations in permits, authorizations, or contracts, representative sampling, sampling and analysis in accordance with requirements of 40 C.F.R. Part 136, and the proper operation of any pretreatment facilities specified for any user in category 2I, category 2FS and category 3, category 3A and category 4 users, as appropriate. These inspections are a "walk-through" type and do not involve effluent sampling. These inspections should confirm that all required facilities are in place and being properly operated. A CEI may be done concurrently with the compliance sampling inspection (CSI) described below. All category 3, 3A, 2I, 2FS and 4 facilities will receive a CEI, and/or CSI, annually. 
(3)  Compliance sampling inspection. 
a.  The purpose of the compliance sampling inspection (CSI) is to insure that the provisions of this article are being complied with, and to protect the board's sewer and wastewater system. Compliance sampling inspection is necessary to determine the nature of constituents discharged by users to the board's sewer and wastewater system. 
b.  Any user is subject to a CSI. A CSI for those industrial users in specific categories may be required in cases of interference, pass through, or upset at the board's wastewater treatment plant. 
c.  Users will be contacted by a representative of the board or general manager at the inception of a CSI. 
d.  For category 3, 3A or 2I users, the user will be required to take samples from the user's wastewater discharge and conduct or obtain laboratory analysis for the sample at a frequency specified by the general manager and for parameters specified by the general manager. 
e.  All sampling and analysis must meet applicable technical and professional standards. For wastewater sampling and analysis, all activities must meet the requirements of 40 C.F.R. Part 136, which is incorporated by reference into this article. Analytical parameters will include all parameters contained in the user's permit, authorization, or contract, if one exists; parameters addressed in this article, and any other parameter which is: 
1.  Contained in the priority pollutant scan referred to in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and Clean Water Act National Pollutant Discharge Elimination system (NPDES) application requirements; 
2.  Which the board or general manager reasonably believes may be present in the user's wastewater, or 
3.  Which may have caused or have the potential to cause pass through or interference or other upset of the board's wastewater treatment system. 
f.  The board or general manager may require respirometry testing as part of the sampling and analysis. Respirometry testing may utilize the POTW biomass as control while determining the affect of the proposed waste stream on the oxygen uptake rate of the control in accordance with Part 2710 B., Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 18th edition, 1992, American Public Health Association, 1015 15th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005. 
g.  The board or general manager reserves the right to split samples and run an independent confirmatory laboratory analysis of the user's wastewater. Nothing in this section affects the board and general manager's right to conduct random sampling of a user's discharge. 
h.  All costs of CSI sampling will be borne by the user. The board and general manager will be responsible for any random sampling or split samples taken at the user's facility. 
i.  CSIs are anticipated to involve multiple samples over a one month period to ensure compliance in light of variability of processes and wastewater discharges. 
j.  Representatives of the board or general manager shall be permitted reasonable access to all user facilities for the purpose of conducting activities relating to the CSI, which may include observation and inspection of processes, treatment facilities, materials handling, monitoring and laboratory facilities, and related records and other information in the user's possession. 
k.  Representatives of the board or general manager may submit written questions or requests for information from any user relating to compliance with the user's permit, authorization, or contract, any requirement of this article, or any state or federal law relating to wastewater discharge. 
l.  Copies of CSI reports and all information and documents utilized for their preparation, including laboratory analyses, bench sheets, and quality assurance/quality control information must be kept by the user for a period of five (5) years. 
(4)  Compliance tracking program. 
a.  The purpose of the compliance tracking program (CTP) is to insure that the provisions of this article are being complied with, and to protect the board's sewer and wastewater system, and obtain additional information regarding users with multiple exceedences, instances of noncompliance, or with wastewater high in strength for pollutants which could harm the board's wastewater plant. Compliance tracking is necessary to determine the nature of constituents discharged by users to the board's sewer and wastewater system over a longer period of time. 
b.  Any user in non-compliance with its permit, authorization, contract, or this article is subject to the CTP. Additionally, users which have the potential to discharge constituents which could alone or in conjunction with other discharges cause or contribute to pass through, interference, or upset at the board's wastewater treatment plant are subject to the CTP. 
c.  Users will be contacted by a representative of the board or general manager at the inception of a CTP. 
d.  Upon being placed on the compliance tracking program, users must establish compliance. The user will be sampled monthly for a period of time up to three (3) consecutive months. If non-compliance continues, the user may be continued on the CTP for a subsequent three-month period. If there has been no significant non-compliance with any discharge parameter, the user will be sampled only once in the next quarter. If the user continues in compliance, it will be sampled once during the following six (6) months. If the user is in compliance at this sampling, it will revert to the sampling frequency established in the permit, authorization, or contract so long as compliance is maintained. If at any time, sample results indicate a significant non-compliance situation, the user will be placed on a monthly CSI schedule and may be required to repeat the CTP again and shall be required to establish compliance through the procedure described above. 
e.  Results of self monitoring may also be used in determining compliance so long as sampling and analytical methods meet the requirements of this article. 
f.  Copies of CTP reports and all information and documents utilized for their preparation, including laboratory analyses, bench sheets, and quality assurance/quality control information must be kept by the user for a period of five (5) years. 
g.  Nothing in this subsection affects the board and general manager's authority to bring enforcement actions or seek such other relief as provided by law against a user. 
(5)  Significant non-compliance. Any user that meets one or more of the following criteria shall be considered in significant noncompliance: 
a.  Chronic exceedence of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of all the measurements taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the same parameter. 
b.  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of all the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC=1.4 for fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other parameters except pH). 
c.  Any other exceedence of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum or longer-term average) that the control authority determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public). 
d.  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare, or to the environment, or has resulted in the POTW exercising its emergency authority under paragraph 40 CFR Part 403.8(f)(l)(vi)(B) to halt or prevent such a discharge. 
e.  Acute exceedence of a wastewater discharge limit by greater than twice the concentration or mass loading established by a permit, authorization, or contract. 
f.  Exceedence of the maximum allowable concentration for pollutants identified in section 23-135. 
g.  Failure to comply with any condition of a permit, authorization, or contract for three (3) consecutive reporting periods or greater. 
h.  Any discharge to the wastewater collection and treatment system without a permit, authorization, or contract where such permit, authorization, or contract is required by this article. 
i.  Failure to operate, maintain, or implement treatment, management practices, or other activities necessary to controlling pollutants in the discharge to the board's sewer and wastewater treatment system. 
j.  More than one (1) instance of non-compliance as set forth in subsection (6) below. 
Provided, however, that the general manager may determine based upon the totality of circumstances that an event or events which would otherwise constitute significant non-compliance as set forth herein does not warrant categorization as significant non-compliance. 
(6)  Noncompliance. Any other failure to meet any requirement of this article or any permit, authorization, or contract issued pursuant to this article. Noncompliance includes but is not limited to the following: 
a.  Failure to meet a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance. 
b.  Failure to provide any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules. 
c.  Failure to meet any condition or limitation of any permit, authorization or contract. 
d.  Failure to accurately report noncompliance. 
e.  Any other violation(s) which the board and/or general manager determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the board and/or general manager's pretreatment program. 
f.  Any exceedence not defined as significant-non-compliance. 
Provided, however, that the general manager may determine based upon the totality of circumstances that an event or events which would otherwise constitute compliance as set forth herein does not warrant categorization as non-compliance.

a.  The board or general manager may order any user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge or discharges in violation of, exceeding, or in non-compliance with any requirement of this article or any permit, authorization, or contract pursuant to this article to show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the city regarding the violation, exceedence, or non-compliance, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause before the city why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation.

    The schedules of rates for gas and services furnished from the Municipal Utilities Board of Decatur, Morgan County, Alabama, doing business as Decatur Utilities (also referred to herein as "the city"), are hereby established as provided in this division. Within this division, "Decatur Utilities" shall be understood to mean the General Manager of Decatur Utilities or his designee authorized to act for the Decatur Utilities Gas System.

b.  A demand charge per one thousand (1,000) cubic feet (MCF) based on the city's average demand cost (see paragraph (5)). 
c.  A commodity charge per MCF based on the city's average commodity cost [see paragraph (5)]. 
d.  A mark-up of $1.4173 per MCF, which may be adjusted from time to time, as hereinafter provided. 
(3)  Minimum bill. The minimum monthly bill under this rate schedule shall be equal to the access fee. 
(4)  Rules and regulations. All gas rendered shall be subject to the rules and regulations from time to time promulgated and adopted by the municipal utilities board. 
(5)  Adjustment of rates; contracts for future delivery of gas. The rate at which the customer is billed will be increased or decreased in proportion to any increase or decrease in the cost of natural gas purchased by the city from its suppliers. 
Any such adjustment shall be effective beginning with bills rendered on or after the effective date of such increase or decrease in the charges to the city for natural gas purchased by it from its suppliers. 
The average demand cost shall be the city's total gas supply demand cost less any contract pass through calculated as follows. The initial base average demand shall be defined as the total demand costs from pipelines for the period November 1, 2016 through October 31, 2017 less any contract pass through which said initial base average demand amount shall equal two million six hundred sixty-seven thousand dollars ($2,667,000.00). For each year thereafter, when the average demand is less than the average demand of the base year, the calculated difference will be placed in a gas enhancement fund as more fully defined in subdivision (H) below. If the average demand in any subsequent year is higher than that of the then current base average demand, the higher amount shall become the new base average demand. The total amount in the gas enhancement fund shall not exceed ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00). Any excess funds above the ten million dollar-limit may be credited to the deferred accounts maintained by the city or used to reduce rates. 
The average commodity cost shall be the city's total gas purchase costs consisting of commodity charges, transportation charges, and charges for losses, divided by the total volume of gas purchased by the city. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, subject to such limitations as to price and volume as the city council of the city may impose, the municipal utilities board of the city, in its discretion, and from time to time, may enter into contracts to purchase gas for future delivery to or for the use and benefit of a particular customer, a particular class of customers, or particular classes of customers; and, for the purpose of any adjustment of rates under this division, the cost of such gas purchased for future delivery may, at the board's discretion, be used to calculate the adjusted rate of only that customer or class or classes of customers for which such gas was purchased. 
(6)  Accounting for variances in demand and commodity costs. The city's actual costs of gas vary each month because of its demand/purchase ratio and purchase contract cost adjustment clauses. Any differences in the actual and calculated average demand and commodity costs will be debited or credited each month to deferred accounts maintained by the city for that purpose. Refunds and adjustments from the city's suppliers may be credited to the deferred accounts maintained by the city, used directly in the operation and maintenance of the city's gas system, applied to capital projects, or used to reduce rates.

Any such adjustment shall be effective beginning with bills rendered on or after the effective date of such increase or decrease in the charges to the city for natural gas purchased by it from its suppliers. 
The average demand cost shall be the city's total gas supply demand cost less any contract pass through calculated as follows. The initial base average demand shall be defined as the total demand costs from pipelines for the period November 1, 2016 through October 31, 2017 less any contract pass through which said initial base average demand amount shall equal $2,667,000.

a.  A monthly access fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00), which may be adjusted from time to time, as hereinafter provided. 
b.  A demand charge per one thousand (1,000) cubic feet (MCF) based on the city's average demand cost (see paragraph (5)). 
c.  A commodity charge per MCF based on the city's average commodity cost (see paragraph (5)). 
d.  A mark-up of $1.3048 per MCF, which may be adjusted from time to time, as hereinafter provided. 
(3)  Minimum bill. The minimum monthly bill under this rate schedule shall be equal to the access fee. 
(4)  Rules and regulations. All gas service rendered shall be subject to the rules and regulations from time to time promulgated and adopted by the municipal utilities board. 
(5)  Adjustment of rates; contracts for future delivery of gas. The rate at which the customer is billed will be increased or decreased in proportion to any increase or decrease in the cost of natural gas purchased by the city from its suppliers. 
Any such adjustment shall be effective beginning with bills rendered on or after the effective date of such increase or decrease in the charges to the city for natural gas purchased by it from its suppliers. 
The average demand cost shall be the City's total gas supply demand cost less any contract pass through calculated as follows. The initial Base Average Demand shall be defined as the total demand costs from pipelines for the period November 1, 2016 through October 31, 2017 less any contract pass through which said initial Base Average Demand amount shall equal two million six hundred sixty-seven dollars ($2,667,000). For each year thereafter, when the average demand is less than the average demand of the base year, the calculated difference will be placed in a gas enhancement fund as more fully defined in subdivision (h) below. If the average demand in any subsequent year is higher than that of the then current base average demand, the higher amount shall become the new base average demand. The total amount in the gas enhancement fund shall not exceed ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00). Any excess funds above the ten million dollar-limit may be credited to the deferred accounts maintained by the city or used to reduce rates. 
The average commodity cost shall be the city's total gas purchase costs consisting of commodity charges, transportation charges, and charges for losses, divided by the total volume of gas purchased by the city. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, subject to such limitations as to price and volume as the city council of the city may impose, the municipal utilities board of the city, in its discretion, and from time to time, may enter into contracts to purchase gas for future delivery to or for the use and benefit of a particular customer, a particular class of customers, or particular classes of customers; and, for the purpose of any adjustment of rates under this division, the cost of such gas purchased for future delivery may, at the board's discretion, be used to calculate the adjusted rate of only that customer or class or classes of customers for which such gas was purchased. 
(6)  Accounting for variances in demand and commodity costs. The city's actual costs of gas vary each month because of its demand/purchase ratio and purchase contract cost adjustment clauses. Any differences in the actual and calculated average demand and commodity costs will be debited or credited each month to deferred accounts maintained by the city for that purpose. Refunds and adjustments from the city's suppliers may be credited to the deferred accounts maintained by the city, used directly in the operation and maintenance of the city's gas system, applied to capital projects, or used to reduce rates. 
(7)  Payment. Bills under this rate schedule will be rendered monthly. Any amount of bill unpaid after due date specified on bill may be subject to additional charges under the city standard policy. 
(b.1)  Firm sales service: Large commercial-Class 45. 
(1)  Applicability. This schedule shall apply to large commercial customers whose monthly consumption equals or exceeds eight hundred (800) MCF for any three (3) months of a twelve (12) consecutive month period commencing with the first month in which use equals or exceeds eight hundred (800) MCF; this rate shall become effective as of the first day of the month following the third month that the customer's consumption equaled or exceeded eight hundred (800) MCF within a period of twelve (12) consecutive month period. Customer will remain in this class a minimum of twelve (12) successive months, or until they become classified in a higher use classification. Gas service under this schedule shall be firm. 
(2)  Monthly rate. The monthly charge shall be the sum of the following components: 
a.  A monthly access fee of thirty dollars ($30.00), which may be adjusted from time to time, as hereinafter provided. 
b.  A demand charge per one thousand (1,000) cubic feet (MCF) based on the city's average demand cost (see paragraph (5)). 
c.  A commodity charge per MCF based on the city's average commodity cost (see paragraph (5)). 
d.  A mark-up of $0.8384 per MCF, which may be adjusted from time to time, as hereinafter provided. 
(3)  Minimum bill. The minimum monthly bill under this rate schedule shall be equal to the access fee. 
(4)  Rules and regulations. All gas service rendered shall be subject to the rules and regulations from time to time promulgated and adopted by the municipal utilities board. 
(5)  Adjustment of rates; contracts for future delivery of gas. The rate at which the customer is billed will be increased or decreased in proportion to any increase or decrease in the cost of natural gas purchased by the city from its suppliers. 
Any such adjustment shall be effective beginning with bills rendered on or after the effective date of such increase or decrease in the charges to the city for natural gas purchased by it from its suppliers. 
The average demand cost shall be the city's total gas supply demand cost less any contract pass through calculated as follows. The initial base average demand shall be defined as the total demand costs from pipelines for the period November 1, 2016 through October 31, 2017 less any contract pass through which said initial base average demand amount shall equal two million six hundred sixty-seven dollars ($2,667,000). For each year thereafter, when the average demand is less than the average demand of the base year, the calculated difference will be placed in a gas enhancement fund as more fully defined in subdivision (h) below. If the average demand in any subsequent year is higher than that of the then current base average demand, the higher amount shall become the new base average demand. The total amount in the gas enhancement fund shall not exceed ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00). Any excess funds above the ten million dollar ($10,000,000.00) limit may be credited to the deferred accounts maintained by the city or used to reduce rates. 
The average commodity cost shall be the city's total gas purchase costs consisting of commodity charges, transportation charges, and charges for losses, divided by the total volume of gas purchased by the city. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, subject to such limitations as to price and volume as the city council of the city may impose, the municipal utilities board of the city, in its discretion, and from time to time, may enter into contracts to purchase gas for future delivery to or for the use and benefit of a particular customer, a particular class of customers, or particular classes of customers; and, for the purpose of any adjustment of rates under this division, the cost of such gas purchased for future delivery may, at the board's discretion, be used to calculate the adjusted rate of only that customer or class or classes of customers for which such gas was purchased. 
(6)  Accounting for variances in demand and commodity costs. The city's actual costs of gas vary each month because of its demand/purchase ratio and purchase contract cost adjustment clauses. Any differences in the actual and calculated average demand and commodity costs will be debited or credited each month to deferred accounts maintained by the city for that purpose. Refunds and adjustments from the city's suppliers may be credited to the deferred accounts maintained by the city, and may be used directly in the operation and maintenance of the city's gas system, applied to capital projects, or used to reduce rates. 
(7)  Payment. Bills under this rate schedule will be rendered monthly. Any amount of bill unpaid after due date specified on bill may be subject to additional charges under the city standard policy. 
(c)  Firm sales service: Industrial-Class 50; and firm transportation service: Industrial-Class 51. 
(1)  Applicability. This schedule applies to industrial customers that use a minimum annual average of eight hundred (800) MCF per month. Service under this rate shall be supplied through a single delivery and metering point. Service can be firm sales service, transportation service, or a combination. If a combination, a letter agreement shall be executed establishing transportation quantity of gas and providing that gas supplied hereunder shall be the first gas through the customer metering point each month. Under transportation service, the customer shall pay others for the purchase of gas. Any customer to which this schedule applies may, with prior written approval of Decatur Utilities, elect to contract for pass through of the city's firm interstate pipelines transportation demand cost; however, any such customer must pay the appropriate monthly rate as provided in paragraph (c)(3)b.2. below. 
(2)  Curtailment of deliveries. Service under this rate schedule is subject to curtailment as provided in the rules and regulations of the city utilities gas system. 
(3)  Monthly rate. The monthly charge shall be the sum of the following components: 
a.  A monthly access fee of four hundred fifty dollars ($450.00), which may be adjusted from time to time, as hereinafter provided. 
b.  Demand charge, either: 
1.  Annualized demand. A demand charge per one million (1,000,000) BTU (dekatherm) of total gas use, whether purchased from or transported by the city, based on the city's average demand cost (see paragraph (8)), or 
2.  Contract pass-through demand. A demand charge per one million (1,000,000) BTU (dekatherm) of total gas used, whether purchased from or transported by the city, based on actual cost as paid by the city to the pipeline(s). Minimum term is one (1) year, and minimum daily contract quantity is fifty-one (51) dekatherms. 
c.  As appropriate to the customer, either: 
1.  A commodity charge per dekatherm of gas purchased from the city based on the city's average commodity cost (see paragraph (8)); or 
2.  If a customer requests the city to purchase for and deliver to it a specific package of gas that exceeds one hundred (100) MCF/day, and such request is approved by Decatur Utilities, a commodity charge calculated on a dekatherm basis equal to the cost of such gas delivered to the city distribution system. 
d.  A mark-up of $0.2017 per dekatherm or $0.20815 per MCF of total gas use, whether purchased from or transported by the city, which may be adjusted from time to time, as hereinafter provided. 
(4)  Unauthorized overrun penalty. If on any day or days a customer should take, without the city's advance approval, a volume of gas in excess of the maximum daily contract volume as stated in the executed gas sales contract, or should a customer take during any curtailment period a volume of gas in excess of the curtailment period quantity entitlement applicable to such customer, said volume shall constitute unauthorized overrun volume, and the customer shall be assessed a penalty as follows: 
a.  Demand penalty. Should customer's overrun result in or cause the city to exceed its current "maximum daily demand" under its contract with its supplier, customer shall be assessed a penalty in the amount of any actual cost incurred by the city as a result of the maximum daily demand violation for which customer was accountable. This demand penalty shall be in addition to the normal charge for the gas and shall be billed at a rate equal to the current demand rate paid by the city to its supplier. The demand penalty shall remain in effect for whatever length of time the city's increased demand is attributable to such customer. 
b.  Contract penalty. Should customer's overrun result in or cause the city to exceed its current maximum daily contract with its supplier, customer shall be assessed a penalty in the amount of any actual cost incurred by the city as a result of such overrun for which customer was accountable. This penalty shall be in addition to the normal charge for the gas and any penalty assessed under a. above, if a. is applicable. 
c.  Curtailment period quantity entitlement penalty. For any gas taken during any "period of curtailment" in excess of the curtailment period quantity entitlement, customer shall be assessed a penalty in the amount of any actual cost incurred by the city as a result of the curtailment violation by the customer. This penalty will be in addition to the normal charge for the gas and any penalty assessed under a. or b. above, if applicable. The city, at its discretion, may waive any penalty created hereunder for minor unauthorized overruns; however, the city may require a written statement from customer explaining circumstances that made overruns necessary. 
(5)  Payment. Bills under this rate schedule will be rendered monthly. Any amount of bill unpaid after due date specified on bill may be subject to additional charges under the city standard policy. 
(6)  Rules and regulations. All gas service rendered shall be subject to the rules and regulations from time to time promulgated and adopted by the municipal utilities board. 
(7)  BTU determination. The heating value of the gas delivered (British thermal units) shall be calculated on the dry basis at fourteen and seventy-three hundredths (14.73) PSIA and at sixty (60) degrees Fahrenheit. For the purpose of determining such heating value, the city may rely on the accuracy of reports furnished to it on such heating value by the city's suppliers of gas, or the city may determine heating value by other methods commonly used in the gas industry. Whenever the city purchases gas from more than one (1) supplier, the customer shall be billed for the weighted average BTU content of all gas purchased or transported by the city. The term "BTU" means British thermal unit. 
(8)  Adjustment of rates; contracts for future delivery of gas. The rate at which the customer is billed will be increased or decreased in proportion to any increase or decrease in the cost of natural gas purchased by the city from its suppliers. 
Any such adjustment shall be effective beginning with bills rendered on or after the effective date of such increase or decrease in the charges to the city for natural gas purchased by it from its suppliers. 
The average demand cost shall be the city's total gas supply demand cost less any contract pass through calculated as follows. The initial Base Average Demand shall be defined as the total demand costs from pipelines for the period November 1, 2016 through October 31, 2017 less any contract pass through which said initial Base Average Demand amount shall equal two million six hundred sixty-seven thousand dollars ($2,667,000.00). For each year thereafter, when the average demand is less than the average demand of the base year, the calculated difference will be placed in a gas enhancement fund as more fully defined in subdivision (h) below. If the average demand in any subsequent year is higher than that of the then current base average demand, the higher amount shall become the new base average demand. The total amount in the gas enhancement fund shall not exceed ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00). Any excess funds above the ten million dollar-limit may be credited to the deferred accounts maintained by the city or used to reduce rates. 
The average commodity cost shall be the city's total gas purchase costs consisting of commodity charges, transportation charges, and charges for losses, divided by the total volume of gas purchased by the city. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, subject to such limitations as to price and volume as the city council of the city may impose, the municipal utilities board of the city, in its discretion, and from time to time, may enter into contracts to purchase gas for future delivery to or for the use and benefit of a particular customer, a particular class of customers, or particular classes of customers; and, for the purpose of any adjustment of rates under this division, the cost of such gas purchased for future delivery may, at the board's discretion, be used to calculate the adjusted rate of only that customer or class or classes of customers for which such gas was purchased. 
(9)  Accounting for variances in demand and commodity costs. The city's actual costs of gas vary each month because of its demand/purchase ratio, purchase contract cost adjustment clauses, and the average BTU content of gas purchased. Refunds and adjustments from the city's suppliers may be credited to the deferred accounts maintained by the city and may be used directly in the operation and maintenance of the city's gas system, applied to capital projects, or used to reduce rates. 
(10)  [Backup service.] Under transportation service for Class 51, the city will provide backup service to customer's transportation service by others up to the customer maximum daily contract demand. The city's charge for this service is covered by items b. and d. of paragraph (3). 
(d)  Firm sales: Flex-Class 80; and Firm transportation: Flex-Class 81. If, in the opinion of Decatur Utilities, the natural gas requirements of an existing or a potential customer may be served by other natural gas suppliers at rates that are lower than rates that would be applicable to gas supplied to such a customer under paragraph (c)(3) above, then Decatur Utilities is authorized, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth below, to negotiate or submit a bid to supply gas to such a customer at a different rate, herein "contract rate," for a fixed term by reducing or discounting the mark-up component of the rate calculated under paragraph (c)(3) above. 
(1)  A contract rate, which in no event shall be less than the cost of such gas to Decatur Utilities, including the purchase price thereof, transportation costs and any applicable taxes or excise charges, shall only be applicable to gas supplied under a contract for a fixed term of not less than one (1) month. 
(2)  A contract rate shall only be available to an existing or a potential customer as to whom Decatur Utilities shall be satisfied by verifiable proof that the procurement by such customer of its natural gas or alternate fuel requirements from another supplier is economically, operationally and physically feasible, and is imminent or is occurring. 
(3)  Gas service at a contract rate shall be available for such period of time and upon such terms providing for interruption and discontinuance as may be included in any contract to which the contract rate is applicable. 
(4)  A contract rate pursuant to this schedule may vary from customer to customer, but the maximum rate for customers who would otherwise be entitled to gas service under paragraph (c) shall not exceed the rate provided in paragraph (c). 
(5)  Any contract that includes a contract rate shall take into account any cost to the gas system of extending service to the customer and shall provide for recovery of such cost by appropriate terms including the duration of the contract, the volume of gas to be supplied pursuant to it, and the actual contract rate included in such contract applicable to such gas. 
(6)  Every contract for the sale of natural gas at the contract rate shall provide for the adjustment of such rate to include all taxes, assessments, governmental or regulatory charges or impositions levied, assessed or increased after the date of such contract which are measured or affected in any way by the sale or delivery of gas to or by the city or the revenue received by the city from the sale of gas. 
(7)  To insure the eligibility of a customer for the contract rate and to insure that all conditions of this schedule have been satisfied, no contract for the sale of natural gas at the contract rate shall be effective until it has been reviewed and approved by the general manager of Decatur Utilities. 
(8)  Payment. Bills under this rate schedule will be rendered monthly. Any amount of bill unpaid after due date specified on bill may be subject to additional charges under the city standard policy. 
(e)  Interruptible sales service: Industrial-Class 60; and transportation service: Industrial-Class 61. 
(1)  Applicability. This schedule applies to industrial customers for interruptible gas service that use a minimum annual average of eight hundred (800) MCF per month. Service under this rate shall be supplied through a single delivery and metering point. Service can be interruptible sales service, interruptible transportation service, or a combination. If a combination, a letter agreement shall be reached establishing transportation quantity of gas, and that gas shall be the first gas through the customer metering point each month. Under transportation service, customer shall pay others for the purchase of gas. 
(2)  Availability. Gas shall be available under this schedule only during "off-peak periods" as recognized by Decatur Utilities, and only when volumes of gas are available in excess of the requirements of the firm customers. Service under this schedule may be interrupted whenever, in the sole judgment of the city, interruption is necessary to prevent an increase in the city's current "maximum daily demand" from the city's wholesale gas supplier or to prevent the city's exceeding its current curtailment period quantity entitlement. Customers receiving gas service under this schedule shall at no time take gas during any "period of interruption." 
(3)  Alternate fuel. Equipment using natural gas supplied under this rate shall have the capability of using an alternate fuel and shall be maintained in readiness to discontinue use of natural gas upon one (1) hours' notice from the city. 
(4)  Penalty. Should a customer fail to comply with any notice from the city calling for interruption or curtailment of "interruptible gas," the customer shall be assessed a penalty as follows: 
a.  Demand penalty. Should customer's overrun result in or cause the city to exceed its current "maximum daily demand" with its supplier, customer shall be assessed a demand penalty in the amount of any actual cost incurred by the city as a result of the maximum daily demand violation for which customer was accountable. This demand penalty shall be in addition to the normal charge for the gas and shall be billed at a rate equal to the current demand rate paid by the city to its supplier. The demand penalty shall remain in effect for whatever length of time the city's increased demand is attributable to such customer. 
b.  Contract penalty. Should customer's overrun result in or cause the city to exceed its current maximum daily contract with its supplier, customer shall be assessed a penalty in the amount of any actual cost incurred by the city as a result of such overrun for which customer was accountable. This penalty shall be in addition to the normal charge for the gas and any penalty assessed under [subsection] a. above, if a. is applicable. 
c.  Curtailment period quantity entitlement penalty. For any gas taken during any "period of interruption," customer shall be assessed a penalty in the amount of any actual cost incurred by the city as a result of the curtailment violation by the customer. This penalty will be in addition to the normal charge for the gas and any penalty assessed under subsection a. or b. above, if applicable. The city, at its discretion, may waive any penalty provided hereunder for minor violations of interruption or curtailment orders; however, the city may require a written statement from customer explaining circumstances which made the violation of order necessary. 
(5)  Monthly rate. The monthly charge shall be the sum of the following components: 
a.  A monthly access fee of four hundred fifty dollars ($450.00), which may be adjusted from time to time, as hereinafter provided. 
b.  As appropriate to the customer, either: 
1.  A commodity charge per dekatherm of gas purchased from the city based on the city's average commodity cost (see paragraph (9)); or 
2.  If a customer requests the city to purchase for and deliver to it a specific package of gas that exceeds one hundred (100) MCF/day, and such request is approved by Decatur Utilities, a commodity charge calculated on a dekatherm basis equal to the cost of such gas delivered to the city distribution system. 
c.  A mark-up of $0.1829 per dekatherm or $0.18875 per MCF of total gas use, whether purchased from or transported by the city, which may be adjusted from time to time, as hereinafter provided. 
(6)  BTU determination. The heating value of the gas delivered (British thermal units) shall be calculated on the dry basis at fourteen and seventy-three hundredths (14.73) PSIA and at sixty (60) degrees Fahrenheit. For the purpose of determining such heating value, the city may rely on the accuracy of reports furnished to it on such heating value by the city's suppliers of gas, or the city may determine heating value by other methods commonly used in the gas industry. Whenever the city purchases gas from more than one (1) supplier, the customer shall be billed for the weighted average BTU content of all gas purchased or transported by the city. The term "BTU" means British thermal units. 
(7)  Facilities charge. Should the city determine revenues from the estimated volumes of gas available under this schedule are insufficient to justify its investment or its operation and maintenance of facilities necessary to provide service to a customer, the city, at its discretion, may remove or abandon said facilities. However, should a customer desire to have facilities left in place for a bona fide reason, the city and the customer may mutually agree on a "yearly facilities charge," which shall be payable in advance. 
(8)  Minimum bill. The minimum monthly bill under this rate schedule shall be equal to the access fee. 
(9)  Adjustment of rates; contracts for future delivery of gas. The rate at which the customer is billed will be increased or decreased in proportion to any increase or decrease in the calculated average commodity cost of natural gas purchased by the city from its suppliers. 
Any such adjustment shall be effective beginning with bills rendered on or after the effective date of such increase or decrease in the charges to the city for natural gas purchased by it from its suppliers. 
The average commodity cost shall be the city's total gas purchase costs consisting of commodity charges, transportation charges, and charges for losses, divided by the total volume of gas purchased by the city. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, subject to such limitations as to price and volume as the city council of the city may impose, the municipal utilities board of the city, in its discretion, and from time to time, may enter into contracts to purchase gas for future delivery to or for the use and benefit of a particular customer, a particular class of customers, or particular classes of customers; and, for the purpose of any adjustment of rates under this division, the cost of such gas purchased for future delivery may, at the board's discretion, be used to calculate the adjusted rate of only that customer or class or classes of customers for which such gas was purchased. 
(10)  Accounting for variances in demand and commodity costs. The city's actual average commodity cost of gas varies each month because of its purchase contract cost adjustment clauses and the average BTU content of gas purchased. Refunds or adjustments from the city's suppliers may be credited to the deferred accounts maintained by the city, and may be used directly in the operation and maintenance of the city's gas system, applied to capital projects, or used to reduce rates. 
In the event that the volume of gas supplied to the city exceeds the city's volume under its firm transportation contract, and on that account interruptible transportation charges are thereby incurred by the city in order to serve interruptible customers, then such interruptible transportation charges shall be apportioned to and paid by the interruptible customers who, during the period the interruptible transportation charges were incurred, were taking interruptible gas from the city's system. 
(11)  Rules and regulations. All gas service rendered shall be subject to the rules and regulations from time to time promulgated and adopted by the municipal utilities board. 
(12)  Payment. Bills under this rate schedule will be rendered monthly. Any amount of bill unpaid after due date specified on bill may be subject to additional charges under the city standard policy. 
(f)  Interruptible sales: Flex-Class 90; and Interruptible transportation: Flex-Class 91. If, in the opinion of Decatur Utilities, the natural gas requirements of an existing or a potential customer may be served by other natural gas suppliers at rates that are lower than rates that would be applicable to gas supplied to such a customer under paragraph (e)(5) above, then Decatur Utilities is authorized, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth below, to negotiate or submit a bid to supply gas to such a customer at a different rate, herein "contract rate, "for a fixed term by reducing or discounting the mark-up component of the rate calculated under paragraph (e)(5) above. 
(1)  A contract rate, which in no event shall be less than the cost of such gas to Decatur Utilities, including the purchase price thereof, transportation costs and any applicable taxes or excise charges, shall only be applicable to gas supplied under a contract for a fixed term of not less than one (1) month. 
(2)  A contract rate shall only be available to an existing or a potential customer as to whom Decatur Utilities shall be satisfied by verifiable proof that the procurement by such customer of its natural gas or alternate fuel requirements from another supplier is economically, operationally and physically feasible, and is imminent or is occurring. 
(3)  Gas service at a contract rate shall be available for such period of time and upon such terms providing for interruption and discontinuance as may be included in any contract to which the contract rate is applicable. 
(4)  A contract rate pursuant to this schedule may vary from customer to customer, but the maximum rate for customers who would otherwise be entitled to gas service under paragraph (e) shall not exceed the rate provided in paragraph (e). 
(5)  Any contract that includes a contract rate shall take into account any cost to the gas system of extending service to the customer and shall provide for recovery of such cost by appropriate terms including the duration of the contract, the volume of gas to be supplied pursuant to it, and the actual contract rate included in such contract applicable to such gas. 
(6)  Every contract for the sale of natural gas at the contract rate shall provide for the adjustment of such rate to include all taxes, assessments, governmental or regulatory charges or impositions levied, assessed or increased after the date of such contract which are measured or affected in any way by the sale or delivery of gas to or by the city or the revenue received by the city from the sale of gas. 
(7)  To insure the eligibility of a customer for the contract rate and to insure that all conditions of this schedule have been satisfied, no contract for the sale of natural gas at the contract rate shall be effective until it has been reviewed and approved by the general manager of Decatur Utilities. 
(8)  Payment. Bills under this rate schedule will be rendered monthly. Any amount of bill unpaid after due date specified on bill may be subject to additional charges under the city standard policy. 
(g)  Inflation (CPI) adjustment. In addition to rate adjustments herein above authorized, in order to make appropriate adjustments of rates for natural gas service to accommodate for the effects of inflation: 
(1)  Within sixty (60) days after the end of its fiscal year, commencing with fiscal year 2017, Decatur Utilities shall make an evaluation of the then current revenues from all gas system services to determine whether such rates are providing and will continue to provide: 
a.  1.50 revenue coverage for debt service obligations related to the provision of natural gas service; or 
b.  The constant availability of a minimum cash reserve for gas system operations defined as: One and one-half (11/2) month's total operating expenses including natural gas purchases, less depreciation; or 
c.  A positive net income ratio of not less than two (2) percent defined as: "Change in net position" less "capital contributions," divided by "total operating revenues." 
(2)  If, by resolution adopted as of November 30 of 2017 and of each succeeding year, Decatur Utilities shall determine and certify to the City Council of Decatur that any of the criteria set forth in (g)(1) above are not met, then, unless the city council shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such certification, direct otherwise, by ordinance or resolution, Decatur Utilities may increase the "monthly access fee" and/or the "mark-up" portions of its rates commencing with the January billing cycle in 2018 and for each year thereafter in which such certification has been made, by the greater of, in the aggregate: Three (3) percent of the then current rates, or that percentage by which the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Pricing Index, All Urban Consumers (CPIU) U.S. City Average All Items ("Price Index") shall have increased on July 1 for the year in which the certification is made over the Price Index as of July 1 of the preceding year. 
(h)  Gas enhancement fund. To plan and pay for the enhancement and/or expansion of the gas infrastructure owned by the city, a gas enhancement fund (the "fund") shall be maintained as funded elsewhere in this division. The monies in this restricted fund shall reside on the statement of net position of the gas system of the city. Amounts in the fund may be withdrawn, spent, pledged or otherwise used for the enhancement and/or expansion of the gas infrastructure operated by the city upon the request of either the city council or the municipal utilities board, with the written consent by resolution of the other.

ARTICLE III. - ROTATION SYSTEM 

Sec. 24.5-41. - Findings and purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish acceptable standards and criteria for the provision of rotation wrecker services to the city by wrecker operators voluntarily requesting to participate in the city's rotation system; provided, however, nothing herein shall obligate the city to the use of operators on the rotation list as the sole or exclusive means of providing wrecker services to the city and the city reserves the right to contract independently of the provisions of this article for wrecker services for any particular aspect of municipal operation it deems appropriate.

The applicant shall furnish the chief with a list of operator personnel, including each person's full name, current address, date of birth, driver's license number, and social security number. The chief will then conduct a criminal background investigation and driver's history check on all individuals listed on the application.

Applicant must furnish any additional information requested by the department's representative during the investigation.

Wrecker companies operating more than one rotation wrecker business within the city must maintain completely separate offices, required documentation, logs, and assigned rotation wreckers at the approved locations. Attempts to circumvent the intent of the rotation system will result in the removal of all wrecker companies and operators associated in any way to the offending wrecker operator.

Participation on the rotation log shall not constitute a property interest. Authorization under this article is void if the business address or location of facilities is changed. Further, any change in ownership due to sale, merger, dissolution, death or any other reason shall result in the removal of the business from the rotation list and shall necessitate a new application being filed. 
(4)  Submission of daytime and nighttime telephone numbers.

(9)  Response while impaired prohibited. No operator shall respond to a dispatch when he or she has consumed alcohol in any amount or has ingested either prescription or non-prescription drugs that may impair motor skills. No operator shall respond to a dispatch when he or she is under the influence of any controlled substance.

If an operator is not capable at the time of dispatch to so respond, he/she shall immediately notify the department's communication center of this fact. If the operator provides immediate notice of delay and provides a reasonable time of arrival on-scene, the operator may take up to a total of thirty (30) minutes from the time of dispatch to arrive.

(c)  Whenever heavy equipment or large vehicles are involved in an accident and it is determined by the police officer on-scene that the wrecker next up on the rotation list does not have adequate equipment to handle the accident, then the department reserves the right to call a large wrecker from an operator on the rotation list capable of providing the needed services. If a call is made under these circumstances, the operator being passed over will be repositioned on the rotation list accordingly. Calls for a large wrecker will be rotated among the companies having qualified large wreckers. 
(d)  If the operator does not arrive on-scene within the time requirements established herein or if the public health, safety and welfare necessitate more expeditious action, the police department reserves the right to request the services of the next operator on the rotation list. Under these circumstances, the operator who received the first call will forfeit his/her position on the rotation list for that turn. Any operator who is late in responding to dispatches for wrecker service without justification may be subject to penalties as provided herein. 
(e)  When emergency conditions necessitate, the city reserves the right to request the services of the operator who is best able to handle the situation and/or who can reach the scene most expeditiously, regardless of the operator's position on the rotation list. If a dispatch is made under these circumstances, the operator making such a response will not forfeit his/her respective position on the rotation list. 
(f)  The chief has the right to inspect any wrecker or equipment of an operator on the city's rotation list at any time to ascertain if it is being properly maintained and all required equipment is on the wrecker and in proper operating order.

(2)  A hearing shall be held within fourteen (14) days after the filing of a written request for a hearing before the city council. The chief shall notify the operator of the time, date and place of the hearing. At such public hearing, the operator shall be provided an opportunity to be heard by the city council, which may also choose to hear from city representatives and any others who may have relevant information. 
(3)  The city council shall render a decision by resolution within ten (10) days from the date of such hearing. Such resolution shall set forth the decision of the city council and the reasons for the same. 
(b)  The department will reinstate to the rotation list a suspended operator upon written application after the period of suspension has elapsed and after the department has determined that such operator is in compliance with all regulations of this article. 
(c)  If any violations of the regulations or provisions of this article are deemed by the chief to be of such a nature as to endanger public safety, the chief shall immediately suspend from the rotation list the operator committing such violation, and then provide notice pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) above.

Sec. 25-10.1. - Planned residential development districts. 
(A)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to permit flexibility in the development of substantial tracts of land by permitting a variety of residential uses in accordance with a specific plan for large scale developments. Planned residential developments are of such a nature as to require specific regulations separate and apart from those of general application to the other districts created in the zoning ordinance. Said planned residential developments are intended to permit exceptions and variations from standard zoning regulations to permit flexibility in the development of the real estate affected; which can result in; a maximum choice in the types of environment and living units open to the public; the preservation of open space, trees, and other natural features; the development of recreation areas; an efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets; and the creation of an environment of a stable character in harmony with surrounding development. 
(B)  Definition. A Planned Residential Development District is a tract of land consisting of five (5) or more acres, developed as a unit for residential use, which when completed will contain two (2) or more residential buildings. The density, lot size, bulk, yard sizes, and other nonuse standards within the district shall comply with the standards established by the planning commission for each specific planned residential development, subject to the minimum requirements of the particular PRD zone applicable to the area. The various PRD zones created are as set forth below. 
(C)  Adoption of ordinance. A Planned Residential Development District of the number hereafter provided for may be created by the city council through the adoption of an ordinance in accordance with the normal procedures providing for the adoption of amendments to the zoning ordinance. Upon the adoption of such ordinance, the area within the district shall be designated on the "City of Decatur, Official Zoning Map" as a "PRD" district, with the PRD number so adopted, and an application for specific planned residential development may be made as hereinafter set forth. 
(D)  Submission of development plan for concept approval. Any person seeking approval of a planned residential development within a Planned Residential Development (PRD) District shall submit three (3) copies of the PRD development plan, including all appropriate text, maps, and graphics, to the planning department for transmittal to the planning commission. Said documents shall include, but need not be limited to: 
(1)  A land use plan, describing, and indicating the area to be developed for specific uses; 
(2)  A master plan, consisting of appropriate text, maps, and graphics, describing the design concept and location of all structures and improvements to be constructed and of proposed streets, parks, other public ways, drainage, public utilities, and other public facilities, provided, however, that detailed engineering plans shall not be required for master plan approval; 
(3)  A description, related to the land use and master plan, of the density, location and type of residential units and accessory uses and structures to be developed; 
(4)  A developmental schedule which shall include the anticipated starting and completion dates of the total planned residential development; and 
(5)  Proposed covenants; 
(6)  Such other information as the planning commission shall require. 
    All documents relating to streets, parks, public ways, drainage, utilities, and other public facilities shall be submitted to the city engineer at the time of original application. The planning commission may provide for the submission of copies of relevant documents to other city departments and agencies at the time of application. The fee for filing an application for a planned residential development shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00). All plans and related information shall be sufficient detail to enable the planning commission and other city departments to evaluate the proposed development in accordance with the provisions of this section. Within forty-five (45) days after the filing of the proposed PRD development plan for a planned residential development, the city planning department shall transmit said development plan to the planning commission, together with the department's recommendations and comments. 
(E)  Plan review. The planning commission shall investigate and ascertain that the plans for a planned residential development shall comply with the following conditions: 
(1)  That the tract of land for the planned residential development comprises not less than five (5) acres. It shall be owned, leased or controlled by a single person or corporation, or by a group of individuals or corporations subject to common control. Conveyance of portions of the area is permissible after original approval of the plan concept by the planning commission. 
(2)  That the establishment, maintenance and operation of the planned residential development will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare. 
(3)  That the establishment of the planned residential development will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement or surrounding property for uses permitted in that zoning district. 
(4)  That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other necessary facilities will be provided. 
(5)  That adequate measures will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets, and that the proposed planned residential development shall be accessible from public roads that are adequate to carry the traffic that will be imposed upon them. 
(6)  That the uses contained in the planned residential development are residential in character, except for such accessory uses as the planning commission shall determine are desirable and appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the development, and except for such uses specifically provided for herein. 
    To aid in the consideration of a planned residential development, the planning commission may request additional reports and information from the applicant, the city planning department, and any other city officer or department. The planning commission may impose such restrictions and conditions on the planned residential development which are in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this section. It may, upon its own initiative, hold public hearings and make such other investigations as it shall deem necessary. 
(F)  Approval of planned residential development. Upon completion of its investigation, the planning commission may approve or reject the development plan as submitted or may approve said plan as modified. 
    Upon approval of the development plan a copy shall be filed among the records of the Decatur Building Department and the original thereof recorded in the office of the probate court of Morgan County and shall thereafter be binding upon the applicants, their heirs, successors, and assigns, shall limit and control the issuance and validity of permits and certificates, and shall restrict and limit the use and operation of all land and structures within the area designated in the development plan to all conditions and limitations specified in such plan and the approval thereof; provided, however, that the Decatur Building Department may, upon a showing of engineering or architectural necessity therefor, permit minor changes in the location of structures and site improvements, if such minor changes will not change the character of the development, or otherwise cause the development plan to fail to meet the conditions specified herein. Pursuant to the same procedure and subject to the same limitations and requirements by which a development plan was approved, filed and recorded, it may be amended or withdrawn, either partially or completely, if all land and structures remaining comply with all the conditions and limitations of the development plan and approval thereof and all land and structures withdrawn comply with all regulations established by all other subsections of this section. 
    After the approval and recording of the development plan, the developer may proceed with final engineering and construction plans which shall conform in all respects with the ordinances and subdivision regulations of the City of Decatur. Upon approval of the planning commission the planned residential development may be constructed in phases, provided that each phase shall meet the standards of a subdivision as set forth in the subdivision regulations of the City of Decatur and is in compliance with the approved development plan. The planning commission may enter into such agreements with the developer as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of the development plan or any specific phase thereof, and may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the planned residential development which it may deem necessary for the protection of the public interest.

Sec. 25-29. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of Alabama has in Title 11, Chapter 19, Sections 1-24; Title 11, Chapter 45, Sections 1-11; Title 11, Chapter 52, Sections 1-85, and Title 41, Chapter 9, Section 166 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Decatur, Alabama, does ordain as follows: 
(b)  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Decatur, Alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands, and; 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(d)  Objectives. The objectives of this ordinance are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and; 
(7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 98-3487A, § 1, 1-25-99; Ord. No. 15-4210, § 1 , 2-2-15) 
Sec. 25-30. - General provisions. 
(a)  Lands to which this article applies. This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the corporate limits of Decatur, Alabama. 
(b)  Basis for area of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study (FIS), dated December 16, 2005, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS and data for Morgan County are hereby adopted by reference. Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. 
(c)  Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this article prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
(d)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. 
(e)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing ordinance, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(f)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and; 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of Decatur, Alabama, or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(h)  Penalties for violation. Violation of the provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for not more than six (6) months, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(i)  Savings clause. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this article is for any reason held to be noncompliant with 44 Code of Federal Regulation 59-78, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this article. 
(j)  Termination of flood insurance. Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act authorizes FEMA to deny flood insurance to a property declared by the state, county, or municipal government to be in violation of the local floodplain management ordinance. A section 1316 declaration shall be used when all other legal means to remedy a violation have been exhausted and the structure is noncompliant. Once invoked, the property's flood insurance coverage will be terminated and no new or renewal policy can be issued; no flood insurance claim can be paid on any policy on the property, and disaster assistance will be denied. The declaration must be in writing (letter or citation), from the community to the property owner and the applicable FEMA Regional Office, and must contain the following items: 
(1)  The name(s) of the property owner(s) and address or legal description of the property sufficient to confirm its identity and location; 
(2)  A clear and unequivocal declaration that the property is in violation of a cited state or local law, regulation or ordinance; 
(3)  A clear statement that the public body making the declaration has authority to do so and a citation to that authority; 
(4)  Evidence that the property owner has been provided notice of the violation and the prospective denial of insurance; and 
(5)  A clear statement that the declaration is being submitted pursuant to section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended. 
(6)  If a structure that has received a section 1316 declaration is made compliant with the community's floodplain management ordinance, then the section 1316 declaration can be rescinded by the community and flood insurance eligibility restored.

(2)  Construction stage. For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit holder shall provide to the building director an as-built certification of the regulatory floor elevation or floodproofing level using appropriate FEMA elevation or floodproofing certificate immediately after the lowest floor or floodproofing is completed. When floodproofing is utilized for non-residential structures, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. Any work undertaken prior to submission of these certifications shall be at the permit holder's risk. The building director shall review the above referenced certification data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being allowed to proceed. Failure to submit certification or failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop work order for the project. 
(c)  Duties and responsibilities of the administrator. Duties of the building director shall include, but not be limited to: 
(1)  Review all development permits to assure that the permit requirements of this article have been satisfied; and assure that sites are reasonably safe from flooding. 
(2)  Review proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been received from governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1334). Require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file. 
(3)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 25-32(b), then the building director shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other sources in order to administer the provisions of section 25-32. 
(4)  Verify and record the actual elevation in relation to mean sea level (or highest adjacent grade) of the regulatory floor level, including basement, of all new construction or substantially improved structures in accordance with section 25-31(b)(2). 
(5)  Verify and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea level to which any new or substantially improved structures have been floodproofed, in accordance with sections 25-32(b)(2) and 25-32(e)(2). 
(6)  When floodproofing is utilized for a structure, the building director shall obtain certification of design criteria from a registered professional engineer or architect in accordance with section 25-31(b)(1)(c) and section 25-32(b)(2) or section 25-32(e)(2). 
(7)  Notify adjacent communities and the Alabama Department of Natural Resources prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs/Office of Water Resources/NFIP State Coordinator's Office. 
(8)  For any altered or relocated watercourse, submit engineering data/analysis within six (6) months to the FEMA and state to ensure accuracy of community flood maps through the letter of map revision process. Assure flood carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse is maintained. 
(9)  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the building director shall make the necessary interpretation. Any person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this article. 
(10)  All records pertaining to the provisions of this ordinance shall be maintained in the office of the building director and shall be open for public inspection. 
(Ord. No. 98-3487A, § 1, 1-25-99; Ord. No. 15-4210, § 1 , 2-2-15) 
Sec. 25-32. - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
(a)  General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement of the structure; 
(2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
(3)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; and, 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves and other coverings and devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this ordinance, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and, 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
(9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding, and; 
(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this ordinance, shall be undertaken only if the non- conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(b)  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with estimated BFE),the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 25-32(a)(4), "elevated buildings." 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any non-residential structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 25-31(c)(6). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed and substantially improved on: 
1.  Individual lots or parcels, 
2.  In new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, 
3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or 
4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed and substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
2.  Where no base flood elevation exists, the manufactured home chassis and supporting equipment is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength and is elevated to a maximum of sixty (60) inches (five (5) feet) above grade. 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Refer: section 25-32(a), above). 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, fully licensed and ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions; or 
2.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of section 25-32(b)(3)a. and c., above. 
(4)  Standards for subdivisions. 
a.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
b.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
c.  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards, and; 
d.  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser. 
(c)  Floodways. 
(1)  Floodway: Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 25-30(b), are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point; 
b.  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the adopted regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; 
c.  A community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of 44 CFR § 65.12, and receives the approval of the administrator. 
d.  Require, until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. 
e.  Only if section 25-32(c)(1)b., c. or d., above are satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 25-32. 
(d)  Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations (approximately A zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 25-30(b), where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (Approximate A zones), the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 25-30(b), then the building director shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of section 25-32. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions ((2) and (4)) shall apply: 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty-five (25) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  All development in zone A must meet the requirements of section 25-32(a) and (b)(1) through (4). 
(4)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Also, in the absence of a base flood elevation, a manufactured home must also meet the elevation requirements of section 25-32(b)(3) (b)(2) in that the structure must be elevated to a maximum of sixty (60) inches (five (5) feet). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 25-32(a)(4) "elevated buildings". The building director shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(e)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). Areas of special flood hazard established in section 25-30(b), may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 25-32(a)(4), "elevated buildings". The building director shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction and the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level or two (2) feet (if no map elevation is listed), above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 25-31(b)(1)(c) and 25-31(b)(2). 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
(Ord. No. 98-3487A, § 1, 1-25-99; Ord. No. 15-4210, § 1 , 2-2-15) 
Sec. 25-33. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The board of zoning adjustment as established by the city shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this ordinance. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building director in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of zoning adjustment may appeal such decision to the circuit court, as provided in Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-52-81. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of zoning adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this ordinance. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and, 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this ordinance [ Ord. No. 15-4210 ] are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The building director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs/Office of Water Resources upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the board of zoning adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.

This term includes structures which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
    For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: (1) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or; (2) any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.

(6)  Erosion and sediment control - Minimum requirements. Construction which disturbs one (1) acre or more of ground surface within the city limits of Decatur will require a general permit for stormwater runoff control. This permit will be obtained from ADEM (Alabama Department of Environmental Management) by the owner/developer of the property. A copy of the approved permit will be submitted to the city engineering department prior to beginning site construction, grading or clearing activity. The owner/developer, along with his construction plans, will be responsible for preparing a construction best management practices plan (CBMPP) using good engineering practices that will result in specific strategies to protect water quality.

Waste material such as asphalt, petroleum products, sealants, concrete, etc., will not be left on site in contact with stormwater runoff. 
Any information provided by the public as to betterment of the proposed BMP or as to the failure of an operating BMP can be addressed to the city engineering department for consideration or correction. 
Any owner/developer of a site one (1) acre or larger which does not conform to these regulations is subject to a stop-work order and/or a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day. 
Once an owner/developer has been notified by the city engineering department that his/her BMP is not meeting the requirements of these regulations, the owner/developer will have ten (10) working days to correct the problem before fines become effective. The fine will be enforced each day thereafter that the BMP is not corrected. The owner/developer will be responsible for the correction and for notifying the city engineering department when the corrections are made. 
Maintenance of any detention or retention facilities and any other post-construction water quality measures will have to be maintained on a continuing basis.

    In addition to the duties set forth elsewhere in this Act, the board shall: 
(a)  Advise the governing body on matters of personnel administration, including the development of personnel rules, a job classification plan and a systematic pay plan; 
(b)  Represent the public interest in the improvement of personnel administration in the city service; 
(c)  Make any inquiry which it may consider desirable concerning personnel administration in the city service; and 
(d)  Make recommendations to the governing body with respect to any of the foregoing duties. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965) 
Sec. 6. - Rules, classification plans and pay plans. 
    So long as the same are not inconsistent with this Act, the board shall have the power to recommend to the governing body the adoption of rules and regulations for the operation of the merit system established hereby, a job classification plan, a pay plan, and a plan for the mandatory and/or permissive retirement of employees. Within sixty (60) days after the presentation of a recommendation of the board, the governing body shall act upon the same, and if the governing body by resolution adopts the recommendation of the board, the same shall become operative and have the force and effect of law. All rules, regulations and pay and classification plans in effect at the time of the adoption of this Act which are not in conflict with the provisions hereof shall remain in force and effect after the effective date of this Act until the same are altered, amended or repealed in the manner hereinafter provided. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965) 
Sec. 7. - Amendments and repeal. 
    Any rule, determination, regulation or plan may be amended or repealed in whole or in part in the same manner as is provided herein for the making of such rules, determinations, regulations or plans. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965) 
Sec. 8. - Job classification plan. 
    After the adoption by the governing body of a job classification plan, allocation of each position in the classified service shall be made by the board with the approval of the governing body to the end that all positions in the same class shall be sufficiently alike to permit use of a single descriptive title, the same qualification requirements, the same test of competence, and the same pay scale. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965) 
Sec. 9. - Pay plan. 
    After the adoption by the governing body of a pay plan and any rules of its administration, the board, with the approval of the governing body, will assign each position to one of the pay ranges provided in the pay plan to the end that the rate or range of compensation for each class provided for in the pay plan shall be such as to reflect fairly the differences in duties and responsibilities in the various classes. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965) 
Sec. 10. - Examinations. 
    Eligibility for original appointment or promotion to vacancies in positions in the classified service occurring after the adoption of this Act shall be determined by competitive examinations of applicants therefor. Examinations shall be in such form as will fairly test the abilities and aptitudes of the applicants with respect to the duties to be performed. Applicants who pass the test and otherwise qualify for original appointment or promotion, as the case may be, shall be placed on the appropriate eligible list for the vacancy in the order of the grades they obtained on the examination. The board may refuse to examine, or after examination refuse to certify the name of anyone who is found to lack any of the established qualification requirements for the examination or position for which he applies or who is physically so disabled as to be unfit to perform duties of the position to which he seeks appointment, or who has been convicted of or is under indictment for any crime involving moral turpitude or who has been guilty of any infamous or disgraceful conduct or who has been dismissed from the public service for delinquency or misconduct or who has intentionally made a false statement of any material fact or practiced or attempted to practice any deception or fraud in his application, or in his examination. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965) 
Sec. 11. - Temporary appointment. 
    Pending the availability of a list of names certified as provided in section 13 hereof, positions may be filled by temporary appointment. The governing body by resolution adopted pursuant to a recommendation of the board may grant permanent status in a position in the classified service so long as such position remains in the classified service to any employee who has served in a vacancy in a position then in the classified service by temporary appointment for at least twelve (12) months and who has made a passing score on his examination, if at the time of such action by the governing body no such list of names has been so certified for the vacancy in which the said employee is serving. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965) 
Sec. 12. - Lists of names of persons available for appointment. 
    Lists of names of persons available for appointment to a vacancy in a position in the classified service will be selected for certification as provided in section 13 hereof in the order in which they appear on the reemployment list, promotional eligible list, and original appointment eligible list for said vacancy, which lists shall have priority one over the other in the order named. A former employee with probationary status with respect to the vacancy may, with the approval of the appointing authority, have his name placed at such position on the promotional eligible list as the appointing authority may designate. Policies and procedures for administering eligible lists and covering the duration, cancellation, replacement, and consolidation of such lists, and removal or suspension of names therefrom shall be provided in the personnel rules. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965) 
Sec. 13. - Method of filling vacancies. 
    Except as hereinafter provided, vacancies in positions in the classified service shall be filled by the appointing authority by the appointment of a person whose name is certified, within thirty (30) days after certification. Certification shall be made upon request of the appointing authority therefor whenever a vacancy exists, the appointing authority, in his discretion, determines that such vacancy shall be filled, and the name of an applicant for such vacancy is eligible for certification. If there is a reemployment list with respect to the vacancy, only the top name on such list shall be eligible for certification. In the event there is no such reemployment list, and the names on the promotional eligible list for such vacancy plus the names on the original appointment eligible list for such vacancy equal three (3) or more, the three (3) names ranked highest on the said promotional eligible list shall be eligible for certification; provided, however, should the said promotional eligible list not contain three (3) names, then the names appearing thereon, plus such of the names ranked highest on the said original appointment eligible list as will be sufficient to bring the number certified to three (3) shall be eligible for certification. If after making a reasonable effort it should prove impossible for the appointing authority to locate any of the persons so certified or should it become known to the board that any person so certified is not willing to accept the position, the appointing authority may request that additional names be certified until the appointing authority has available to him a list from which to make the appointment containing the aforesaid authorized number of persons all of whom are available for such appointment and willing to accept the position, or, in the event that the list certified to the appointing authority contains fewer than the authorized number of available and willing persons as aforesaid from which to make a selection, the appointing authority, in his discretion, may choose from the remaining certified names, make a temporary appointment, or make no appointment. In the event that there does not exist an employment list which the board deems to be appropriate from which to fill the vacancy, the board shall prepare such a list within a reasonable time after receipt of the request of the appointing authority that eligibility be certified. Provided, however, nothing herein contained shall be construed as preventing an appointing authority, in his discretion, from withdrawing his request for the aforesaid certification, either before or after such certification has been made in response to his request therefor. Whenever a person has been certified to and rejected by an appointing authority three (3) times, the board may remove the name of such person from the eligible list on which his name appeared. A person shall be deemed to have been so rejected by an appointing authority when a vacancy is filled from an eligible list on which his name appeared and such person was not selected to fill the vacancy. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965) 
Sec. 14. - Probation. 
    Except as provided in sections 2 and 3, to acquire permanent status in a position in the classified service so long as such position remains in the classified service, employees shall be subject to a period of probation. The regular period of probation shall be six (6) months; provided, however, the board may adopt rules and regulations specifying a longer or shorter period of probation for a designated class or classes, or for extension of the probation period for any individual probationary employee, but no probationary period may extend beyond twelve (12) months. The work and conduct of employees with a probationary status shall be subject to close scrutiny and evaluation. An employee retained beyond the end of the probationary period shall have permanent status in the position in which he was so retained so long as that position remains in the classified service if, but only if, the appointing authority files a written statement with the board affirming the fact that the services of the employee have been found to be satisfactory. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965) 
Sec. 15. - Absences; hours of work. 
    Rules shall be adopted in the manner hereinbefore provided prescribing hours of work and the conditions and length of time for which leaves of absence with pay and leaves of absence without pay may be granted. These shall cover such matters as vacations, holidays, sick leaves, leaves for military service, and leaves granted so that the employee can seek election to public office in Morgan County. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965; Act No. 848, p. 1690, Acts of Alabama 1975) 
Sec. 16. - Lay off of employees. 
    Any employee may be separated from his position by being laid off. Reduction in the number of employees shall be made in such class or classes as the appointing authority may designate; provided, however, within each class affected by such reduction employees shall be laid off in the following order: 
(1)  Temporary employees who did not have permanent status in some other position in the classified service at the time they were appointed to their present position; 
(2)  Probationary employees who did not have permanent status in some other position in the classified service at the time they were appointed to their present position; 
(3)  Other temporary employees; 
(4)  Other probationary employees; and 
(5)  Employees having permanent status in the position in the classified service. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965) 
Sec. 17. - Dismissal, demotion and suspension of employees. 
    Any employee may be dismissed, suspended without pay or demoted by his appointing authority for any violation of the provisions of this Act or whenever the good of the service will be served thereby or the employee's work, performance, conduct on or off the job, or insubordinate attitude so warrants; provided, however, that no employee may be suspended without pay for more than fifteen (15) working days at any one (1) time or for more than thirty (30) days in any one (1) year; and provided further, that no employee shall be dismissed, suspended without pay or demoted for political considerations other than those enumerated in section 21 hereof. Any person appointed to a position who has secured his certification therefor through fraud shall be removed by his appointing authority and shall not thereafter be eligible for examination for or appointment to any position except by unanimous permission of the board. Each appointing authority shall promptly report to the board in writing the fact and extent of all disciplinary action taken by him against employees holding positions in the classified service. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965) 
Sec. 18. - Procedure for protesting certain disciplinary action. 
    An employee shall have the right to protest any disciplinary action taken against him by his appointing authority; provided, however, an employee serving by temporary appointment and an employee having probationary status shall have no right to protest any such disciplinary action, unless such employee had permanent status in some other position at the time he was appointed to his present position. An employee desiring to protest any disciplinary action directed against him by his appointing authority shall file a protest in writing with the board and with his appointing authority within seven (7) days of the date on which the disciplinary action was taken and request a hearing before the board. Within seven (7) days after receipt of the protest, his appointing authority shall file with the chairman of the board and mail to the employee by certified mail a statement specifying the charges against such employee on which the disciplinary action was based. Upon the filing of such charges, the said chairman shall call a meeting of the board to be held within thirty (30) days after the filing of such charges to hear such protest, and shall forthwith give notice by certified mail to the employee and his appointing authority of the time and place of such meeting. The board shall have the authority to continue the hearing from time to time as may be necessary. In preparing for and conducting such hearing, the chairman and secretary-treasurer of the board shall each have the power to administer oaths, and to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, documents and accounts pertaining to the subject under investigation. 
    Subpoenas issued as herein provided shall be served (and the fees and allowances for the service thereof shall be the same) as is provided by law for the service of subpoena issued by the court. Said fees and allowances in connection with the service of such subpoenas issued at the request of the appointing authority or the board. Such subpoenas issued at the request of the employee shall be served as aforesaid but only after such employee has deposited sufficient security with such sheriff or other officer as will guarantee payment of such fees and allowances for such service. In the event any person is duly summoned to appear and testify or produce evidence, or both, before the board, and such person refuses to attend or testify or produce such evidence, or any of them, in obedience to such summons, the board shall have the right to invoke the aid of the court at law. In such event, and upon proper showing by the board to the court, the court shall issue, or cause to be issued, an order or subpoena requiring such person to appear before the board and produce all evidence and give all testimony relating to the issue within his knowledge. Any person failing to obey any such summons by either of said officers of the board without good cause, to be determined by the court, may be punished by the court in the same method as is provided by law for contempt of the court and any person failing to obey any such order or subpoena of the court, may be proceeded against by the court as is by law provided in the case of contempt of such court. In addition, any employee of the city who fails to obey any of such orders or subpoenas may be disciplined as provided in section 17. 
    At the hearing, the employee and his appointing authority shall each have the right to be represented by counsel. Such hearing shall be governed by rules of practice and procedure adopted by the board, and in conducting such hearing, the board shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence. No informality of procedure in the conduct of such hearing shall invalidate any decision made by the board. At the conclusion of the hearing, the board shall render a decision (a) affirming the disciplinary action taken if it is reasonably satisfied from the evidence offered at the hearing that the disciplinary action taken was lawful or was not too severe; or (b) reversing the action of the appointing authority if it is reasonably satisfied from such evidence that the disciplinary action taken was not lawful; or (c) modifying the disciplinary action taken and prescribing the proper penalty if it is reasonably satisfied from such evidence that the employee was subject to some disciplinary action, but that the penalty imposed was too severe. If the board's decision reduces the severity of the disciplinary action taken against the employee, the board, in its decision, may provide that the employee shall be reinstated with or without pay; provided, however, in the event any employee is so ordered to be reinstated with pay, such pay shall not exceed the amount that the employee as such earned during the thirty (30) days next preceding the taking of the disciplinary action in question. A copy of the board's decision shall be filed with the city clerk of the city and such decision shall become effective immediately upon such filing, and it shall become final ten (10) days thereafter unless reversed or modified as hereinafter provided. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965) 
Sec. 19. - Appeal to the court. 
    Decisions of the board may be enforced in the court by mandamus, injunction, or other appropriate proceedings. The employee, the appointing authority, or the city may, within ten (10) days after the decisions of the board is rendered, appeal to the court from any decision of the board affirming, imposing or refusing to affirm or impose dismissal or demotion as disciplinary action by filing notice of such appeal with the court and causing a copy of such notice to be served on the appointing authority and any member of the board. Upon the filing of such notice, the board shall file with the court a certified transcript of the proceeding had before it with respect to the appeal, and its decision in the matter. The appeal shall be heard at the earliest possible date by the court sitting without a jury on the issues made before the board and the trial in the court shall be de novo. No bond shall be required for such an appeal and the cost of such appeal shall be taxed against the unsuccessful party. At the conclusion of such hearing the court may affirm, reverse, or modify the board's decision, or remand the case for further proceedings before the board, as the court in its discretion shall deem best. If the order of the court is that the employee shall be reinstated with pay, such pay shall not exceed the amount that the employee as such earned during the thirty (30) days next preceding the taking of the disciplinary action in question. An appeal may be taken from any judgment of the court to the Court of Appeals as is now provided by law. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965) 
Sec. 20. - Records to be maintained by board. 
    The board shall maintain adequate records of its proceedings, of its own official acts, the examination record of every candidate, and the employment record of every employee. 
(Act No. 324, p. 443, Acts of Alabama 1965) 
Sec. 21. - Political activities prohibited. 
    No person holding a position in the classified service shall seek or attempt to use any political endorsement in connection with any appointment to a position in the classified service. No person holding a position in the classified service shall use or promise to use, directly or indirectly, any official authority or influence, whether possessed or anticipated, to secure or attempt to secure for any person an appointment or advantage in appointment to a position in the classified service, or an increase in pay or other advantage in employment in any such position, for the purpose of influencing the vote or political action of any person, or for any consideration. No employee holding a position in the classified service shall, directly or indirectly, pay or promise to pay any assessment, subscription, or contribution for any political organization or purpose, or solicit or take any part in soliciting any such assessment, subscription, or contribution. No person shall solicit any such assessment, subscription, or contribution of an employee holding a position in the classified service. No employee holding a position in the classified service shall be a candidate for nomination or election to any public office in Morgan County, or shall take any part in the management or affairs of any political party or in any political campaign, except to exercise his right as a citizen privately to express his opinion and to cast his vote, unless on authorized leave of absence for such purpose. Any person holding a position in the classified service who violates any provision of this section may be disciplined by dismissal, suspension without pay, or demotion as provided in section 17 of this act. In addition, any person, including but not limited to persons holding a position in the classified service (irrespective of whether or not such persons holding a position in the classified service have or have not theretofore been disciplined therefor as hereinbefore provided) who wilfully violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punished as provided by Section 327 of Title 15 of the Code of Alabama of 1940.
