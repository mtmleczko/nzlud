PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of New Smyrna Beach, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1975 Code, as supplemented through February 25, 1992, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the city Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and Heather Waldroup and John Welch, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Edward Beazley, City Attorney, and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Editor's note- This subsection has been editorially deleted as preempted by F.S. ch. 171 procedure for involuntary annexation and contraction of municipal boundaries and specifically F.S. § 171.022 which repealed all special acts or municipal charter provisions in effect on October 1, 1974, regarding involuntary annexation. 
(2)  Any unincorporated territory lying contiguous or adjacent to any boundary of the City of New Smyrna Beach, Volusia County, may be annexed to and become part of such City of New Smyrna Beach subject to the jurisdiction, obligation[s], benefits and privileges of the City of New Smyrna Beach, except as herein otherwise provided, under the following method, to wit: 
(a)  Such territory may be integrated into and made a part of the City of New Smyrna Beach upon petition of not less than two-thirds of the qualified electors residing in the territory to be integrated into and made a part of said City of New Smyrna Beach, who are registered freeholders on the county registration records. 
(b)  The petition or petitions for integration into the City of New Smyrna Beach shall be substantially in the following form: 
"PETITION TO INTEGRATE TERRITORY INTO THE CITY OF NEW SMYRNA BEACH, VOLUSIA COUNTY, FLORIDA. 
    This petition is filed pursuant to Laws of Fla., ch. 57-1606, for the purpose of integrating the herein described lands into the City of New Smyrna Beach, Florida. 
    We, the undersigned, being qualified electors residing in the hereinafter described territory, who are duly registered as freeholders on the county registration records, hereby file this, our petition, for annexation of the following described territory into the City of New Smyrna Beach, Florida, in accordance with the above referred to laws of Florida, to wit: 
(Here describe territory) 
    (Here place signatures of petitioners, showing in detail place of residence, with street and number where available.)" 
(c)  As many separate petitions as may be desired may be filed affecting the same area and if such petitions are insufficient for any reason, additional or supplemental petitions may be filed. 
(d)  When completed, such petitions, and additional or supplemental petitions, shall be filed with the city clerk of the City of New Smyrna Beach, who shall, within five (5) days after the filing of such petitions with him, deliver the same to the supervisor of registration of Volusia County, who shall thereupon check the names of petitioners and shall certify within thirty (30) days that the signatures on each petition are genuine, and that the petitioners whose names appear on said petitions are qualified in all respects under this act to sign said petitions. In the event that the number of qualified petitioners is found to be insufficient, supplemental petitions may be filed until the sufficient number is obtained, and the supervisor of registration shall have the same time, as herein provided, to check such supplemental petition as the original petition. After filing with the city clerk, no petition shall be withdrawn, nor shall any petitioner be permitted to withdraw his signature therefrom. 
(e)  The petition or petitions meeting the requirements of this act shall thereupon be presented to the city commission of the City of New Smyrna Beach, at its next regular meeting, together with the aforesaid certificate of the supervisor of registration, and a certificate from the city attorney, showing a sufficient legal description of the area to be annexed. 
(f)  Within six (6) months after the presentation of such approved petitions, the city commission in its discretion may adopt a resolution or enact an ordinance setting forth the filing of said petitions, certification of the supervisor of registration as to the sufficiency of each petition and the certification of the engineer or the surveyor as to the sufficiency of the description of the land contained therein, and shall resolve or ordain that the said area is incorporated into the municipality, effective as of a particular date, determined by the city commission, which effective date shall be not more than one year from the time of the presentation of the petition for annexation as provided for under the provisions of this act; or the governing body may reject said petitions by resolution within such six (6) months' period or by nonaction on their part within said period, whereupon said petitions shall become null and void. No petitions for annexing the same territory shall be filed until after a lapse of one year from the time of such rejection by resolution or nonaction. 
(B)  Upon the adoption of a resolution or enactment of an ordinance annexing any such unincorporated territory to the City of New Smyrna Beach, such territory shall become a part of said City of New Smyrna Beach on the effective date; provided, however, that such territory shall not be subject to ad valorem taxation until January first following the effective date of annexation; provided, however, that territory annexed pursuant to this act shall be subject to the prior bonded indebtedness of said city; and such territory shall be subject to the jurisdiction, obligations, benefits and privileges of the municipality, except as herein otherwise provided, the same as the area constituting the municipality to which it was annexed. 
(C)  After the effective date of such annexation all residents in the newly annexed territory shall have the same rights to vote in city elections and to hold public office in the city, as though the newly annexed territory had been a part of the said City of New Smyrna Beach for at least three months prior to the effective date of annexation. If the city should have a division into municipal districts or wards for election purposes, the newly annexed territory shall be added to such districts or wards as the governing body of the city shall in its discretion determine. 
(D)  All persons, firms or corporations lawfully licensed to engage in any profession, occupation, trade or business within the annexed territory on the effective date of its annexation may upon paying the license taxes required by the City of New Smyrna Beach thereupon be entitled to carry on such profession, occupation, trade or business in the annexed area without obtaining a required permit or certificate granted by any examining board of the city; but such right may be terminated for cause after a hearing by the appropriate examining board of the city. Such licenses [licensees] must qualify with said examining boards to engage in any profession, occupation, trade or business in the existing area to which the new territory was annexed.

Except as this chapter otherwise provides, the commission may provide, by resolution or by trust agreement, for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the revenue certificates and the revenues of the utilities and services to such officer, board or depository as it may determine for the custody thereof and for the method of disbursement thereof with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine.

(a)  Establishment of zone. 
(1)  The airport height notification zone is established as an overlay zone on the city's official zoning map in New Smyrna Beach Land Development Regulations, § 502.00 et seq. (1991). This zone is to regulate the height of structures and natural vegetation for areas in proximity to the airport. 
(2)  The airport height notification zone is defined as the area within the municipal boundaries, underlying that area extending outward 20,000 feet from the ends and each side of all active runways of the airport. 
(b)  Height notification regulations. All development proposals determined to be potential airport obstructions shall be forwarded to the FAA to be reviewed for conformance with the obstructions standards detailed in 14 CFR 77 or as is otherwise required by federal or state law. A proposed development shall be determined to be a potential airport obstruction if the proposed development would result in a structure or natural vegetation having a height greater than an imaginary surface extending outward and upward from the ends and sides of a publicly licensed airport active runway at a slope of one foot vertical to 100 feet horizontal outward to 20,000 feet or 200 feet above ground level for areas beyond 20,000 feet. Applicants of any development proposal determined by the city to result in a structure that constitutes a potential airport obstruction shall be issued a notice of potential airport obstruction during the development proposal review process by the development services department's director. No proposal for development will be approved for construction and no permit for construction will be issued for any proposal to construct any structure or installation of vegetation that is a potential airport obstruction until the proposed structure or installation of vegetation has been reviewed by the FAA and the FDOT and a variance (if one is required) is approved.

(1)  Receive a building permit for its property; and 
(2)  Make application to the city commission for any approval (or modification of a prior approval) required to develop its property. 
If city commission approval is required for final approval of both the aviation approved construction permit and any other required approval, the applicant for development may make a consolidated application on multiple matters and the city commission may consider these multiple matters at a single consolidated hearing. 
(b)  Procedures for obtaining an aviation approved construction permit. 
(1)  Applicants shall submit to the development services department a completed aviation approved construction permit application form (as provided by the city) and a copy of the notice of proposed construction form submitted to the FAA for the project. Permit requests may be considered by the development services director concurrent with development plan approval consideration. 
(2)  Prior to permit requests being considered for approval, applicants shall submit to the development services department the final determination issued by the FAA based on its review of the applicant's notice of proposed construction submitted in accordance with 14 CFR 77.

(e)  Modifications of the strict application of the requirements of the Florida Building Code. The floodplain administrator shall review requests submitted to the building official that seek approval to modify the strict application of the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code to determine whether such requests require the granting of a variance pursuant to section 26-678 of this article. 
(f)  Coordination of notices and orders. The floodplain administrator and the building official shall coordinate the issuance of all necessary notices or orders to ensure compliance with this article and the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code.

(1)  Submission by the applicant of a showing of food and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site render any provision of this article or the elevation standards of the Florida Building Code inappropriate; 
(2)  Determination by the building trades board that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws, codes or regulations; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a building, or substantial improvement of a building below the elevation required by the Florida Building Code or required by this article, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

The term also includes flood-related damage sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement. Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure taking place over the life of the structure, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before improvement or repair is started. For each building or structure, the cumulative review period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that building or structure. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
2.  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historical structure.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 50-1. - Intent. 
(a)  The city commission finds there are buildings, landmarks, and sites within the city that have specific historic or aesthetic significance, and that the loss of these sites would cause an irreplaceable loss to the people of the city of the aesthetic, cultural and historic values represented by such sites. It is declared as a matter of public policy that protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of such sites of special historic or aesthetic interest or value is a public necessity and is required in the interests of the health, prosperity, safety and welfare of the people. 
(b)  The recognition, protection, enhancement and use of such resources is a public purpose and is essential to the health, safety, morals, and economic, educational, cultural and general welfare of the public, since these efforts result in the enhancement of property values, the stabilization of neighborhoods and areas of the city, the increase of economic benefits to the city and its inhabitants, the promotion of local interests, the enrichment of human life in its educational and cultural dimensions serving spiritual as well as material needs, and the fostering of civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of the past.

(h)  It is the will of the people of the state as expressed in Fla. Const., art. II, § 7, that the state's natural resources and scenic beauty be conserved and protected.

(2)  Enhancement of property values, the stabilization of neighborhoods and business centers of the city, the increase of economic and financial benefits to the city and its inhabitants, and the promotion of local interests; 
(3)  Preservation and enhancement of varied architectural styles, reflecting the city's cultural, social, economic, political and architectural history; and

(Code 1975, § 141/2-5) 
Sec. 50-8. - Approval of changes to landmarks, landmark sites and property in historic districts. 
(a)  Certificate of appropriateness. No person may undertake the following actions affecting a designated landmark, a designated landmark site or a property in a designated historic district without first obtaining a certificate of appropriateness from the commission: alterations of an archeological site or the exterior part of a building or structure, new construction, demolition or relocation. 
(1)  Review of a new construction and alterations to designated buildings and structures shall be limited to exterior changes visible to the public. Whenever any alteration, a new construction, demolition or relocation is undertaken on a designated landmark, a designated landmark site or a property in a designated historic district without a certificate of appropriateness, the chief building official is authorized to issue a stop work order. 
(2)  A certificate of appropriateness shall be in addition to any other building permits required by law. The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness from the commission shall not relieve the property owner of the duty to comply with other state and local laws and regulations. 
(3)  Ordinary repairs and maintenance that are otherwise permitted by law may be undertaken without a certificate of appropriateness provided this work on a designated landmark, a designated landmark site, or a property in a designated historic district does not alter the exterior appearance of the building, structure or archeological site, or alter elements significant to its architectural or historic integrity. 
(4)  No certificate of appropriateness for alteration, new construction, demolition or relocation pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be effective for a period of 15 days subsequent to the commission's decision. If during that 15-day period an appeal is made to the city commission, the decision of the commission shall automatically be stayed pending city review. 
(b)  Application procedures for certificates of appropriateness. 
(1)  Each application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by the required fee. The chief building official shall forward to the commission each application for a permit that would authorize an alteration, new construction, demolition or relocation affecting a designated landmark, a designated landmark site, or a property in a designated historic district. The applicant shall complete an application form provided by the building department containing in part the following information: 
a.  Drawings of the proposed work; 
b.  Photographs of the existing building or structure and adjacent properties; and 
c.  Information about the building materials to be used. 
(2)  The city manager shall determine when an application is complete and may request additional information when such application is determined to be incomplete. 
(c)  Public hearings for certificates of appropriateness. The commission shall hold a public hearing on each certificate of appropriateness within 30 days after receipt of a completed application. The commission shall approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove each application, based on the criteria contained in this section. The commission shall act within 60 days after the close of the public hearing. If the commission fails to decide an application within the specified time period, the application shall be deemed approved. 
(d)  General criteria for granting certificates of appropriateness. In approving or denying applications for certificates of appropriateness for alterations, new construction, demolition or relocation, the commission shall use the following general guidelines: 
(1)  The effect of the proposed work on the landmark or the property upon which such work is to be done; 
(2)  The relationship between such work and other structures on the landmark site or other property in the historic district; 
(3)  The extent to which the historic, architectural or archeological significance, architectural style, design, arrangement, texture, materials and color of the landmark or the property will be affected; 
(4)  Whether the denial of a certificate of appropriateness would deprive the property owner of reasonable beneficial use of his property; and 
(5)  Whether the plans may be reasonably carried out by the applicant. 
(e)  Additional guidelines for alterations. 
(1)  In approving or denying applications for certificates of appropriateness for alterations, the commission shall also use the following additional guidelines, which are based on the United States Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Historic Preservation Projects. 
(2)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property that requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose. 
(3)  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. 
(4)  All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and that seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged. 
(5)  Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
(6)  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship that characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
(7)  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. If replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historical, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
(8)  The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building material shall not be undertaken. 
(9)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archeological resources affected by or adjacent to any acquisition, protection, stabilization, preservation, rehabilitation, restoration or reconstruction project. 
(f)  Additional guidelines for new construction. In approving or denying applications for certificates of appropriateness for new construction, the commission shall also use the following additional guidelines: 
(1)  The height of proposed building shall be visually compatible with adjacent buildings; 
(2)  The relationship of the width of the building to the height of the front elevation shall be visually compatible to buildings and places to which it is visually related; 
(3)  The relationship of the width of the windows to height of windows in a building shall be visually compatible with buildings and places to which the building is visually related; 
(4)  The relationship of solids to voids in the front facade of a building shall be visually compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually related; 
(5)  The relationship of building to open space between it and adjoining buildings shall be visually compatible to the buildings and places to which it is visually related; 
(6)  The relationship of entrance and porch projections to sidewalks of a building shall be visually compatible to the buildings and places to which it is visually related; 
(7)  The relationship of the materials, texture and color of the facade of a building shall be visually compatible with the predominant materials used in the buildings to which it is visually related; 
(8)  The roof shape of a building shall be visually compatible with the buildings to which it is visually related; 
(9)  Appurtenances of a building such as walls, wrought iron fences, evergreens, landscape masses, building facades, etc., shall, if necessary, form cohesive walls of enclosures along a street, to ensure visual compatibility of the building to the buildings and places to which it is visually related; 
(10)  The size of a building, the mass of a building in relation to open spaces, the windows, door openings, porches and balconies shall be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually related; and 
(11)  A building shall be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually related in its directional character, whether this be vertical character, horizontal character or nondirectional character. 
(g)  Additional requirements for demolitions. 
(1)  No certificate of appropriateness for demolitions shall be issued by the commission until the applicant has demonstrated that no other feasible alternative to demolition can be found. The commission may ask interested individuals and organizations for assistance in seeking an alternative to demolition. On all demolition applications, the commission shall study the question of economic hardship for the applicant and shall determine whether the landmark or the property in the historic district can be put to reasonable beneficial use without the approval of the demolition application. In the case of an income-producing building, the commission shall also determine whether the applicant can obtain a reasonable return from the existing building. The commission may ask applicants for additional information to be used in making these determinations, including but not limited to evidence that the plans for a new building on the site will be implemented. If the applicant fails to establish the lack of a reasonable beneficial use or the lack of a reasonable return, the commission shall deny the demolition application. 
(2)  The commission may grant a certificate of appropriateness for demolition even though the designated landmark, designated landmark site or property within the designated historic district has reasonable beneficial use if the commission determines that the property no longer contributes to an historic district or no longer has significance as an historic, architectural or archeological landmark, that the demolition of the designated property is required by a community redevelopment plan or the comprehensive plan. 
(h)  Additional guidelines for relocation. When an applicant seeks to obtain a certificate of appropriateness for the relocation of a landmark, a building or structure on a landmark site, or a building or structure in an historic district or wishes to relocate a building or structure to a landmark site or to a property in an historic district, the commission shall also consider the following: 
(1)  The contribution the building or structure makes to its present setting; 
(2)  Whether there are definite plans for the site to be vacated; 
(3)  Whether the building or structure can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity; and 
(4)  The compatibility of the building or structure to its proposed site and adjacent properties. 
(i)  Appeals to city commission. Within 15 days of the commission decision, any person may appeal to the city commission any decision of the commission on an application for a certificate of appropriateness. The city commission shall approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the application within 60 days after receiving the appeal. 
(j)  Emergency conditions; designated properties. In any case where the chief building official determines that there are emergency conditions dangerous to life, health or property affecting a landmark, a landmark site, or a property in an historic district, the official may order the remedying of these conditions without the approval of the commission or issuance of a required certificate of appropriateness. The chief building official shall promptly notify the chair of the commission of the action being taken. 
(Code 1975, § 141/2-6) 
Sec. 50-9. - Emergency actions; nondesignated properties. 
    The city commission may call an emergency meeting to review a threat to a property that has not yet been designated by the city but appears to be eligible for designation. The city commission may request that a stop work order be issued by the chief building official for a 30-day period in order to provide time to negotiate with the property owner to remove the threat to the property; the commission shall seek alternatives that will remove the threat to the property. During the 30-day period the city commission may initiate steps to designate the property under the provisions of this chapter. 
(Code 1975, § 141/2-7) 
Sec. 50-10. - Conformity with the certificate of appropriateness. 
    All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness shall conform to all provisions of such certificate. It shall be the responsibility of the building department to inspect from time to time any work being performed to assure such compliance. In the event work is being performed not in accordance with such certificate, the chief building official is authorized to issue a stop work order. No additional work shall be undertaken as long as such stop work order shall continue in effect. 
(Code 1975, § 141/2-8) 
Sec. 50-11. - Maintenance and repair of landmarks, landmark sites and property in historic districts. 
(a)  Every owner of a landmark, a landmark site or a property in an historic district shall keep in good repair: 
(1)  All of the exterior portions of such buildings or structures; 
(2)  All interior portions that, if not so maintained, may cause such buildings or structures to deteriorate or to become damaged or otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair; and 
(3)  In addition, where the landmark is an archeological site, the owner shall be required to maintain his property in such a manner so as not to adversely affect the archeological integrity of the site. 
(b)  The commission may refer violations of this section to the building department for enforcement proceedings on any building or structure designated under this chapter so that such building or structure shall be preserved in accordance with the purposes of this chapter. 
(c)  The provisions of this section shall be in addition to the provisions of the building code requiring such buildings and structures to be kept in good repair.

The commission shall also consider information submitted by the applicant, as provided in sections 50-12(g) and (h). The commission shall not consider the request until the applicant has provided the information as outlined in sections 50-12(h) and (i) to explain why the building is not considered significant or if significant, why it should be demolished. The commission shall issue no demolition approval until the applicant has demonstrated that no other feasible alternative to demolition can be found. The commission may ask interested individuals and organizations for assistance in seeking an alternative to demolition.

(10)  The building character is in an established and geographically definable neighborhood united in culture, architectural style or physical plan and development. 
(h)  Demolition of significant buildings. If the commission finds that the building is historically significant the commission may, nevertheless, grant a demolition approval if it finds that one of the following circumstances is met: 
(1)  Undue economic hardship. In any instance where there is a claim of undue economic hardship, the property owner shall submit to the commission prior to the public hearing a report indicating the economic hardship and why the demolition should be allowed. The report shall include the following: 
a.  The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase and the party from whom purchased; 
b.  The assessed value of the land and improvements thereon, according to the two most recent assessments; 
c.  Real estate taxes for the previous two years; 
d.  Annual debt service, or mortgage payments, if any, for the previous two years; 
e.  All appraisals (if any) obtained within the previous two years by the owner(s) or applicant(s) in connection with the purchase, financing or ownership of the property; 
f.  Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked and offers received, if any; and 
g.  Any consideration by the owner as to profitable adaptive uses for the property, including but not limited to possible fair market rents for the property if it were rented or leased in its current condition. 
The commission may require that an applicant furnish such additional information as the commission believes is relevant to the commission's determination of any alleged undue economic hardship. The commission may also require, in appropriate circumstances, that information be furnished under oath. 
In the event that any of the required information is not reasonable available to the property owner and cannot be obtained by the property owner, the property owner shall file with his/her/their affidavit a statement of the information which cannot be obtained and the reasons why such information cannot be reasonable obtained. Where such unobtainable information concerns required financial information, the property owner will submit a statement describing estimates which be as accurate as feasible. 
(2)  Building condition. In any instance where there is a claim the building is not structurally sound and/or suitable for restoration, the applicant shall provide a written report signed by a licensed engineer or architect with experience in historic building restoration stating that the building is structurally unsound and unsuitable for restoration. The commission shall review the credentials of the licensed engineer or architect signing the report and shall find them experienced in historic restorations before the report is accepted. The applicant shall allow members of the commission and commission staff to inspect the interior and exterior of the building. 
Lack of alternative to demolition. In any instance where there is a claim of no other alternative to demolition, the applicant shall provide written documentation of attempts to sell the building at a reasonable and comparable amount or to offer it without charge to purchasers willing to move the building to another location and preserve, rehabilitate, relocate or restore the building. A reasonable and comparable sales price shall be indicated by providing evidence such as recent appraisals, comparable values of properties similar to the building proposed to be demolished or other evidence the commission deems acceptable. 
(i)  Conditions of demolition approval. If the commission grants demolition approval for a historical building as provided in section 50-12(g), the commission shall condition approval on one or more of the following requirements:

(4)  The commission may require that the owner allow salvage activities of the historic building provided the commission finds that there are salvageable materials within the building. Commission staff shall provide evidence to demonstrate that salvageable materials are within or on the building to be demolished; or 
(5)  The commission may require that the owner of a historically significant building meet any other condition that is reasonable to mitigate the demolition of the historic building. 
(j)  Demolition delay. Should the commission determine that a building is historically significant and does not meet at least one of the circumstances allowing demolition of a historically significant structure, the commission shall provide for a demolition delay effective date of up to 120 days from the date of the application. The purpose for the delay is for the commission staff to invite the owner of record of the building to participate in an investigation of alternatives to demolition including, but not limited to, incorporation of the building into the future development of the site; adaptive reuse of the building; utilization of financial incentives to rehabilitate the building; seeking a new owner willing to purchase and preserve, restore or rehabilitate the building; or moving the building. The city will provide the applicant resource assistance including but not limited to potential grant sources, tax relief measures, possible lenders, and available insurers. Once the delay period has ended and if the owner is still seeking demolition of the historically significant structure, the owner shall appear before the commission at a meeting adhering to the notice requirements of section 50-12(f) and present a case as to why the demolition should be granted. The commission shall again consider the reasons for demolition of a historically significant building as indicated in section 50-12(h). The commission shall approve the demolition provided the conditions of section 50-12(i) subsections (1) through (4) are complied with. 
(k)  Demolition by neglect. The owner of a contributing building or structure within an historic district shall comply with all applicable codes, laws and regulations governing the maintenance of property. It is the intent of this section to preserve from deliberate or inadvertent neglect the exterior features of buildings and structures designated as contributing or significant and the interior portions thereof when such maintenance is necessary to prevent deterioration and decay of the exterior.

(5)  Defective or insufficient weather protection for exterior wall covering, including lack of paint or weathering due to lack of paint or other protective covering; or 
(6)  Any fault or defect in the building that renders it not properly watertight or structurally unsafe. 
(l)  Non-compliance. 
(1)  The commission, building official and code enforcement officer are each authorized to institute any and all proceedings in law or equity, as they deem necessary and appropriate to obtain compliance with the requirements of this section, or to prevent a violation thereof. 
(2)  No building permit shall be issued with respect to any premises upon which a significant building has been voluntarily demolished in violation of this section for a period of 22 months after the date of the completion of such demolition. As used herein "premises" includes the parcel of land upon which the demolished significant building was located and all abutting parcels of land under common ownership or control on or subsequent to the date this section was approved. 
(3)  Upon a determination of the commission that a building is a preferably preserved significant building, the owner shall be responsible for properly securing the building, if vacant, to the satisfaction of the building official and/or code enforcement officer. 
(4)  Anyone who demolishes a building or structure identified in section 50-12(e) without first obtaining, and complying fully with the provisions of, a demolition permit shall be subject to a fine of up to $5,000.00. 
(m)  Appeals to the city commission. Within 15 days of the commission decision, any affected person may appeal to the city commission any decision of the commission on an application for a demolition. The city commission shall approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the application within 60 days after receiving the appeal. The city commission shall only approve the demolition of a contributing building if they determine that the request complies with subsections (g)-(j) of this section. 
(n)  Withholding of demolition permit. The demolition permit shall be withheld until the procedural requirements of subsections (f) through (j) inclusive have been satisfied.

In New Smyrna Beach, the Southeast Volusia Historical Society, Inc. will act as the repository for all archaeological artifacts discovered on public property. 
(14)  Salvage archaeology means the archaeological excavation of a site prior to its destruction by construction, erosion, vandalism, or any other form of site disturbance. Archaeological salvage excavations will be concentrated only within the areas to be disturbed in order to save site data which would be lost due to the disturbance, and the extent of the excavations may vary, depending on the significance of the site, time constraints, and the degree of evidence of archaeological resources, at the direction of the city archaeologist. 
(15)  Testing means surface or subsurface excavation, or the use of remote sensing techniques, to determine the type and extent of the archaeological site. Testing may include auguring and establishing archaeological excavation units and requires the screening of excavated material for artifact recovery. When necessary, archaeological salvage excavations may take place following, or in conjunction with, the testing procedures. 
(16)  Emergency situation means any case where the city building official determines that there are emergency situations or conditions dangerous to life, health, or property. In such situations, he or she may order the remedying of the situation or condition. The city building official shall promptly notify the city archaeologist and the city manager if such a situation or conditions occur. 
(c)  Archaeological zones. In order to regulate and restrict disturbances as hereinafter provided in this chapter, and to determine the extent of archaeological investigation and excavations that may be required in a given area, the incorporated area of New Smyrna Beach, Florida, is hereby divided into zones as shown on the archaeological base map entitled, "Archaeological Base Map for New Smyrna Beach, Florida," more particularly described as: 
*See Exhibit "A" attached hereto and by reference made a part hereof. 
    Archaeological zones shall be updated on the base map as additional sites are documented. Zones as delineated on the base map are as follows with titles and abbreviations as indicated: 
(1)  Archaeological zone I is comprised of those areas within the city where there are known significant archaeological sites. 
(2)  Archaeological zone II is comprised of those areas that have a medium or high probability of containing archaeological resources as determined by The Search for Turnbull's Colony, an Archaeological Survey , a report by Southeast Archaeological Research, Inc., dated June 1999. 
(d)  Interpretation of zone boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of zones as shown on the archaeological base map for New Smyrna Beach, Florida, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  Boundaries indicated as approximating center lines of streets, highways or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines; 
(2)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed to follow such lot lines; 
(3)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be construed to follow such city limits; 
(4)  Boundaries indicated as following railway lines shall be construed to be midway between the main tracks; 
(5)  Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to follow the mean high water line. In the event of a change in shorelines, the boundaries shall be construed to move with the change except where such moving would change the archaeological status of a lot or parcel. In such case the boundary shall be interpreted in such a manner as to avoid changing the archaeological status of such lot or parcel; 
(6)  Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of beaches indicated in subsections (1) through (5) above shall be so construed. The distance not specifically indicated on the archaeological base map shall be determined by the scale of the map. 
(7)  Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are not in agreement with those shown on the archaeological base map or in other circumstances not covered by subsections (1) through (6) above, the city archaeologist shall interpret the zoning boundaries. 
(e)  Zone regulations. On city-owned or maintained property, within archaeological zones I and II, the conduct of any ground disturbances on, or activities taking place at or below the present surface of the ground, shall be in compliance with the following regulations: 
(1)  All proposed disturbances on city-owned or maintained property, including but not limited to those by the utilities commission, telephone, cable, and gas companies, the department of transportation, city contractors, and city subcontractors shall be reported to the city archaeologist before those disturbances take place. Furthermore, this chapter will apply only to city-owned or maintained properties within the boundaries of the proposed disturbances. Any additional archaeological testing or excavation by the city archaeologist, within areas outside the proposed disturbances, may be conducted only with written permission of the property owner. 
(2)  Within archaeological zones I and II, disturbances on city-owned or maintained properties shall be subject to intensive archaeological salvage excavations, to be conducted by the city archaeologist prior to any underground disturbance, building construction, or utility excavation, and paid for by the entity initiating the disturbance. The extent of the archaeological salvage excavations by the city archaeologist will be dependent on the extent of the proposed area of construction disturbance and the significance of the archaeological resource. 
(3)  Within archaeological zones I and II, the city archaeologist will be authorized to delay the proposed construction work or major disturbance for up to four weeks. The city manager, or his or her designee may grant additional time, if needed. Early notification of and by the city archaeologist, prior to any disturbances occurring, may minimize or eliminate the need for work delays. The applicant will be informed of any delays. 
(4)  Any disturbances on city-owned or maintained property, which are required to deal with an emergency situation, shall not be subject to the regulations of this chapter. 
(f)  Excavations on public property. No individual shall be allowed to disturb or remove artifacts from public property without the written permission of the city archaeologist, the city manager, or his or her designee. 
(g)  Ownership of artifacts. Artifacts uncovered, recovered, or discovered during testing, salvage archaeology, excavation, or monitoring of city-owned or maintained properties shall remain the property of the city. If additional archaeological testing or excavation by the city archaeologist is permitted within areas outside the proposed disturbances and artifacts uncovered, the city shall obtain written permission from the property owner to analyze, catalog, record, and conserve the artifacts for long-term storage, care, protection, and preservation. 
(h)  Curation of artifacts. Artifacts uncovered, recovered, or discovered during testing, salvage archaeology, excavation, or monitoring shall be washed, if the city archaeologist deems appropriate, cataloged, analyzed, recorded, and conserved by the city archaeologist. The Southeast Volusia Historical Society, Inc. will be the repository for artifacts discovered on city-owned or maintained properties. 
(i)  Human remains. Human skeletal remains, uncovered, recovered, or discovered during testing, salvage archaeology, excavation, or monitoring shall be coordinated with the local medical examiner, the city, city archaeologist, and the state archaeologist. Such remains shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of F.S. ch. 872, and are not subject to private ownership. Such material shall be sensitively treated and, following its analysis by a physical anthropologist, shall be curated at a designated repository or appropriately buried. 
(j)  City archaeologist. The city manager or his or her designee shall appoint a city archaeologist who shall meet the city's requirements and the standards for membership by the register of professional archaeologists and shall have a demonstrated background in historic and prehistoric archaeology. The city archaeologist shall review all applicable ground disturbances on city-owned or maintained property in archaeological zones I and II; shall conduct such testing, excavations, or monitoring as shall be required by this chapter; shall prepare or oversee preparation of a final report on all projects, which report shall meet the guidelines established for archaeological reports by the department of state, division of historical resources, and be in accordance with the Cultural Resource Management Standards and Operations Manual; shall record archaeological sites and develop strategies for preservation of the archaeological resources of New Smyrna Beach; and shall participate in the planning state of applicable projects, to minimize the potential impacts on archaeological sites by any activities proposed for such sites; and shall maintain and update the archaeological base map; and shall advise the city manager concerning archaeological issues.

(Ord. No. 126-06, § 1, 11-28-2006) 
Sec. 52-34. - Imposition of a transportation impact fee. 
(a)  Any person who seeks a building permit for land development activity on or after February 19, 2007, shall be required to pay a transportation impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this article. 
(b)  Unless otherwise provided in section 52-40 of this article, the city shall not issue a building permit or certificate of occupancy for a change of use, whichever occurs first, for any activity requiring payment of a transportation impact fee unless and until the transportation impact fee hereby required has been paid. 
(Ord. No. 126-06, § 1, 11-28-2006) 
Sec. 52-35. - Computation of amount of transportation impact fee. 
(a)  The amount of the transportation impact fee shall be determined by the following fee schedule: 
(1)  Fee schedule. Effective February 19, 2007, the transportation impact fees shall be as adopted with the initial enactment of this article, as adjusted by section 52-41 below, and as amended from time to time by resolution of the city commission. Transportation impact fees provided for in the fee schedule that are calculated based on square footage shall be prorated to the nearest square foot. 
(2)  If a building permit is requested for a building with mixed uses, then the fee shall be determined through using the schedule referred to in subsection (a)(1) by apportioning the space committed to uses specified on the schedule. 
Examples of the use of this fee schedule for a mixed use development in the city are as follows: 
Impact Fee Calculation-EXAMPLE ONE 50 units multifamily × $682.68 = $34,134.00 5,000 sq. ft. retail × $2270.54/1,000 sq. ft. = $11,350.00 10,000 sq. ft. general office × $1685.400/1,000 sq. ft. = $16,900.00 TOTAL FEE $62,384.00  
The total transportation impact fee for Example One would be $62,384.00. 
Impact Fee Calculation-EXAMPLE TWO 50 units multifamily × $682.68/unit = $34,134.00 5,300 sq. ft. retail = 5,300 × $1,685.40/1,000 sq. ft. = $12,031.00 10,400 sq. ft. general office = 10,000 × $1,685.40/1,000 sq. ft. + 400 × $1,074.24/1,000 sq. ft. = $17,328.00 TOTAL FEE $63,493.00  
The total transportation impact fee for Example Two would be $63,493.00. 
(3)  If the type of development activity for which a building permit is applied is not specified on the fee schedule referred to in section 52-35(a)(1), the city manager shall use the fee applicable to the most clearly comparable type of land use on the above fee schedule. The city manager shall be guided in selection of a comparable type by the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation, an Information Report (seventh edition). The city manager shall apply the formula set forth in this article. 
(4)  In the case of a change of use, redevelopment or modification of an existing use on a parcel which requires the issuance of a building permit, the impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new use as compared to the previous use on that parcel. The city manager shall be guided in this determination by the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation, an Information Report (seventh edition). 
(5)  Once the transportation impact fee is paid for those land use types for which the fee is calculated based on acreage, no further transportation impact fee shall be assessed for additional site improvements of the same land use type on that acreage for which the fee was initially assessed. 
(b)  If a feepayer shall opt not to have the impact fee determined according to this article, then the feepayer shall prepare and submit to the city manager an independent fee calculation study for the land development activity for which a building permit is sought. The independent fee calculation study shall follow the prescribed methodologies and formats for the study established by the city manager. The traffic engineering documentation submitted, which will require a preapplication meeting with the city manager, shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made and shall include traffic engineering studies containing documentation of trip generation rates, trip length, and trip data appropriate for the proposed land development activity. 
(c)  This documentation shall be prepared and certified by a registered professional transportation engineer. The city manager shall review the data presented and accept the data if he determines that it meets sound engineering principles. The following formula shall be used by the city manager to determine the impact fee of the development: 
{(TGR°2) × (%NT) × (DF) × (ATL) × (CC°LM)} ° WCL 
In this formula, the various factors are defined as: 
TGR = trip generation rate (this rate varies by land use) 
%NT = percent of all trips that are new trips generated by a land use 
DF = distribution factor of trips using the transportation network 
ATL = average trip length on the transportation network 
CC°LM = average road construction cost per lane mile 
WCL = weighted capacity per lane mile 
    The feepayer shall at the time the independent fee calculation study is submitted pay to the city three percent of the amount of the impact fee identified on the fee schedule for the most nearly comparable type of land use up to a maximum of $4,000.00. These funds shall be used for review and processing the study. This amount shall not be credited against the impact fee payment. 
(d)  In order to obtain the fee rate or to do an independent fee calculation study which applies to more than the structure for which the building permit is requested, the project or development must be controlled by a development of regional impact development order or PUD zoning. 
(e)  An impact fee rate which is based on an independent fee calculation study shall not be applied to the same or similar use on any parcel other than the specific parcel for which the independent fee calculation study was performed except: 
(1)  As provided in subsection (d) above; or 
(2)  In the event the independent fee calculation study is not based on any site specific information or the fee schedule does not address the use for which the independent fee calculation study was performed. 
(Ord. No. 126-06, § 1, 11-28-2006) 
Sec. 52-36. - Payment of transportation impact fee. 
(a)  Any person applying for the issuance of a building permit for land development activity shall pay the transportation impact fee prior to the city issuing the building permit or issuing a change of use certificate of occupancy, whichever occurs first. 
(b)  All funds collected shall be property identified as transportation impact fees and promptly transferred for deposit into the transportation fee trust fund. 
(Ord. No. 126-06, § 1, 11-28-2006) 
Sec. 52-37. - Transportation impact fee trust fund established. 
(a)  There shall be a transportation impact fee trust fund which shall be a separate account in the city's system of accounts. The funds in the trust fund may be held by the city in a pooled cash depository and may be invested with and in the manner of other city funds. 
(b)  Funds withdrawn from this account shall be used only in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 126-06, § 1, 11-28-2006) 
Sec. 52-38. - Use of funds. 
(a)  Funds collected from the transportation impact fees shall be used solely for the purpose of city owned capital improvements to and expansion of the transportation network. Such improvements shall be of the type as are made necessary by the new development. 
(b)  No funds shall be used for periodic or routine maintenance as defined in F.S. § 334.03(13) and (18); however, the city may retain a maximum of two percent of the funds collected from transportation impact fees on an annual basis to offset the city's reasonable administrative costs associated with the collection and administration of said fund. The amount of the city's reasonable administrative costs in connection with the collection and administration of these funds shall be documented as part of the city's annual budget process. Any funds retained by the city to offset the city's reasonable administrative costs in connection with the collection and administration of said funds shall be placed in a separate city account which account shall be used solely for administrative expenses incurred by the city in the collection and administration of funds collected from transportation impact fees. 
(c)  Funds shall be used for capital improvements or expansion within the city. Funds shall be expended in the order in which they are collected. 
(d)  The city manager shall, on an annual basis, establish a prioritized list of capital improvements. In compiling this list, the city manager shall utilize all available traffic and transportation-related data including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Traffic studies and/or development orders related to specific developments; 
(2)  A list and schedule of any county, state or private projects that would change, modify or increase substantially the current traffic or transportation loadings on existing facilities. 
    The five-year transportation capital improvements program (CIP) will be developed from the above-described list. The CIP will identify the specific projects upon which impact fees may be spent to mitigate the impacts associated with new development. Each fiscal year the city manager shall present to the city commission a proposed capital improvement program for transportation, assigning funds, including any accrued interest, from the transportation impact fee trust fund to specific transportation improvement projects and related expenses. Transportation impact fee funds shall be used when sufficient funds are accumulated within the city to initiate an improvement, identified in the CIP, made necessary by new growth. Monies, including any accrued interest, not assigned in any fiscal year shall be retained in the transportation impact fee trust fund, except as provided by the refund provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 126-06, § 1, 11-28-2006) 
Sec. 52-39. - Refund of transportation impact fee paid. 
    Any funds not expended or encumbered by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following six years from the date the transportation impact fee was paid shall be returned to the owner with interest at the rate paid by the state board of administration over the period, provided that the owner makes application therefore within 180 days from the date the transportation impact fee is first subject to a refund as provided herein. The city shall establish a procedure for notifying owners entitled to a refund in accordance with the provisions of this section. Funds shall be considered encumbered when a contract obligating the payment of the funds has been approved by the city commission. 
(Ord. No. 126-06, § 1, 11-28-2006) 
Sec. 52-40. - Exemptions from and credits for transportation impact fee. 
(a)  Exemptions. The following shall be exempted from payment of the transportation impact fee: 
(1)  Alterations to an existing building where no additional units are created, the use is not changed and where no additional vehicular trips will be produced over and above that produced by the existing use;

(3)  The expansion of or addition to a single-family detached house, where the expansion or addition is less than 500 square feet; 
(4)  The replacement of a building or structure with a new building or structure, provided that no transportation impacts will be created over and above those created by the use of the land on or after February 19, 2007; 
(5)  Public education facilities to the extent preempted by state law. 
(b)  Credits, generally. 
(1)  Credits against transportation impact fees shall be available only under the following circumstances: (I) as provided in section 52-35(a)(4) of this article; (ii) for approved roadway improvements or approved right-of-way dedications which are the subject of a transportation impact fee credit agreement as described below; or (iii) for cash contributions allowed under a development order in lieu of approved roadway improvements or approved right-of-way dedications unless prohibited or otherwise provided for in the development order. 
(2)  No credit shall be given for site-related improvements or cash contributions made for site-related improvements under a development order or a development agreement. 
(3)  The city roadway network is identified in Exhibit B which appears at the end of this article. The city roadway network may be amended by ordinance from time to time based on additional transportation studies or the city's 20 years needs plan contained in the transportation element of the city's Comprehensive Plan as it may be amended from time to time. 
(c)  Credits for approved roadway improvements or approved right-of-way dedications. 
(1)  Approved roadway improvements which are eligible for credit against transportation impact fees are capital improvements which (I) correspond to road links or other improvements which have been identified in the city roadway network; and (ii) when completed will carry traffic through the development thereby providing a through connection with other road links identified in the city roadway network. The amount of credits for approved roadway improvements shall equal the actual cost of constructing the approved roadway improvements as evidenced by copies of construction contracts, invoices for payment, cancelled checks, affidavits regarding payment or such other documentation as may be required by the city manager. In no event shall the credit given for approved roadway improvements exceed the construction cost portion of the transportation impact fee. 
(2)  Approved right-of-way dedications which are eligible for credit against transportation impact fees are dedications or conveyances of real property for public right-of-way purposes which: (I) correspond to road links or other improvements identified in the city roadway network; and (ii) provide a through connection between other roads identified in the city roadway network. Approved right-of-way dedications may also include the dedication or conveyance of stormwater drainage and wetland mitigation areas required to serve the proposed road. The amount of credits for approved right-of-way dedications shall equal either: [a] 110 percent of the most recent assessed value by the property appraiser of the real property to be dedicated or conveyed, or [b], if elected by the feepayer, the average of two appraisals of the fair market value of the real property to be conveyed or dedicated prior to the commencement of the development which appraisals have been prepared by two MAI appraiser approved by the city at the sole cost and expense of the feepayer. In no event shall credit be given for approved right-of-way dedications in excess of the total cost of the right-of-way portion of the transportation impact fee. 
(3)  In order to receive credits against transportation impact fees for approved roadway improvements or approved right-of-way dedications, a feepayer shall: (I) prior to the request for any building permits for a development, submit an application to the city requesting transportation impact fee credits which application the city manager has reviewed and has deemed constitutes a complete application, and (ii) prior to the city issuing a building permit or issuing a certificate of occupancy for a change of use, whichever occurs first for a development, enter into a transportation impact fee credit agreement with the city, which has been executed by both the city and the feepayer and which provides, among other things, that the payment of the balance, if any, of any transportation impact fees due for such development, after taking into consideration the approved credits therefor, shall be made prior to the city scheduling the final inspection required for the issuance of any certificate of occupancy for the development. In the event that a feepayer fails to comply with both of these conditions, the feepayer and the feepayer's successors and assigns shall be deemed to have waived any claim for credits in connection with any approved roadway improvements or approved right-of-way dedications made by the feepayer; provided, however, if the city requests approved roadway improvements or approved right-of-way dedications after a development has commenced, then the city may elect to compensate the person making the approved roadway improvements or the approved right-of-way dedication, with that person's consent, in whole or in part, by providing credits against transportation impact fees in accordance with a written agreement between the city and the person making the approved roadway improvements or approved right-of-way dedications, which agreement must be approved by the city commission. 
(4)  Applications for credits against transportation impact fees for approved roadway improvements or approved right-of-way dedications shall be filed with the city manager on an application form provided by the city. The form shall also include a proposed transportation impact fee credit agreement which shall be completed and executed by the feepayer in connection with the application.

Sec. 54-2. - Sale or display of bath salts and herbal incense prohibited. 
(a)  Definitions. For purposes of this article, the following definitions shall apply: 
    Bath salts means any substance containing a synthetic derivative of cathinone or any substance, whether in crystal, powder, liquid, tablet or capsule form, which the person distributing, displaying or offering for sale knows or reasonably should know contains any synthetic stimulant, notwithstanding any disclaimer such as "not for human consumption" and regardless of how the substance is displayed, marketed or labeled, including bath salts, potpourri, or other household products. This definition does not include any pharmaceutical drugs containing synthetic cathinones or other synthetic stimulants approved by the FDA and available with a valid prescription, or traditional bath salts that do not contain synthetic chemical stimulants such as sodium chloride, sea salts, magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts), sodium bicarbonate, and borax. Product packaging that indicates, suggests or implies that a substance mimics the pharmacological effects of cathinone, methcathinone, amphetamines, cocaine or MDMA creates a presumption that the person displaying or offering the substance for sale knows or should know that the substance contains a synthetic stimulant as defined herein. 
    Herbal incense means aromatic plant material, containing or to which any synthetic chemical compound has been added that mimic the effects of a controlled substance, that is displayed, sold, or distributed in a loose, leafy, powder or granular form, or in compressed blocks that can be easily crushed to result in a powder or granular form, and can be placed into pipes, cigarette papers or other drug paraphernalia for ingestion by smoking, inhaling or other methods. 
(b)  Sale, display, or distribution prohibited. It is unlawful for any person or entity to sell, offer for sale, display or distribute, herbal incense or bath salts within the city. 
(c)  Penalties. The provisions of this article may be enforced and violations punished by any of the following methods, alone or in combination, in the sole discretion of the city: 
(1)  The code enforcement board, and all special magistrates appointed by the city, shall have jurisdiction to enforce these provisions, and any person, firm, corporation, or agent determined to be in violation shall be subject to all penalties and remedies available to the board or special magistrates as provided by law. 
(2)  Any violation of this provision may be treated as a civil infraction in accordance with the supplemental municipal code enforcement procedures set forth in F.S. ch. 162.21, as may be amended from time to time. Any code enforcement officer designated by the city manager is hereby empowered to issue a citation to a person when, based upon personal investigation, the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person has committed a civil infraction in violation of this provision. For a person who does not contest the citation, initial violations of this provision shall carry a civil penalty of $250.00, payable to the clerk of court. If contested, the court may impose a penalty of up to $500.00 for each violation. 
(3)  The city may institute any appropriate action or procedure to bring about compliance or remedy a violation.

Sec. 62-31. - Findings. 
    The city commission finds that this article is consistent with the city's comprehensive plan adopted by Ordinance No. 6-90 on July 6, 1990, as amended. 
(Ord. No. 22-96, § 2, 8-27-1996) 
Sec. 62-32. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  This article is enacted to carry out the purpose and intent of and exercise the authority set out in F.S. § 163.3202 and to implement the city's comprehensive plan. It is the specific purpose of this article to provide for administrative procedures to ensure that nothing in the comprehensive plan or land development regulations adopted to implement the plan: 
(1)  Limits or modifies the rights of any person to complete any development that has been authorized as a development of regional impact pursuant to F.S. ch. 380, or the rights of any person who has been issued a final local development order and development has commenced and is continuing in good faith, as provided in F.S. § 163.3167(8); or 
(2)  Shall be construed as affecting validly existing vested rights established pursuant to the common law doctrine of equitable estoppel. 
(b)  This article establishes the sole administrative procedures and standards by which a property owner may demonstrate that private property rights have vested against the provisions of the city's comprehensive plan adopted by Ordinance No. 6-90 on July 6, 1990, as amended. If a determination is made that a development is vested against the city's comprehensive plan, the development is exempt from any consistency or concurrency provisions of the city's comprehensive plan that would otherwise prevent whatever development is vested from taking place as vested. 
(Ord. No. 22-96, § 3, 8-27-1996) 
Sec. 62-33. - Applicability. 
    This article shall apply to the determination of all claims to vested rights status that exist or are asserted on or after August 27, 1996. 
(Ord. No. 22-96, § 13, 8-27-1996) 
Sec. 62-34. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Building permit means a permit to construct or reconstruct any structure, having a roof, and used or built for a shelter enclosure of persons, animals or property of any kind. This definition does not include preliminary permits such as foundation permits, clearing permits or grading permits. 
    Comprehensive plan means the city's comprehensive plan adopted by Ordinance No. 6-90 on July 6, 1990, as amended. 
    Continuing in good faith means the final local development order for a project has not expired, and no period of 90 consecutive days passes without the occurrence, on the land, of development activity that significantly moves the proposed development toward completion, unless the developer establishes that such 90-day lapse in development activity was due to factors beyond the developer's control. 
    Development means the particular development activity authorized by the unexpired final local development order issued for a specific project. 
    Director means the director of the city's development services department. 
    Final local development order means a building permit. 
    Substantial development means that all required permits to complete the development or phase of the development have been obtained; permitted clearing and grading have been completed on the development or phase of the development; and the actual construction of water and sewer lines, or streets, or the stormwater management system, on the development or the phase of the development has been substantially completed.

Sec. 62-35. - Statutory vested rights. 
(a)  Generally. Notwithstanding that all or some part of a development is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan or a new provision of the land development regulations that has been adopted to implement the comprehensive plan, certain development meeting the requirements of this section is deemed to be vested pursuant to F.S. § 163.3167(8). Such development may be completed despite the inconsistency of the development with the comprehensive plan or land development regulations adopted to implement the comprehensive plan. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create rights that otherwise do not exist, including authorization of any action that would pose an imminent peril to the health and safety of the citizens of the city, and any development covered by statutory vested rights shall continue to be subject in all other respects to all laws, ordinances, rules and regulations other than those based on the comprehensive plan or land development regulations to implement the plan with which it would be inconsistent if not covered by statutory vested rights. In addition, the development shall continue to be subject to all terms, conditions, requirements and restrictions contained in the development order that was the basis for the statutory vesting; and any substantial or major change, whether or not it is determined to be a substantial deviation requiring further development of regional impact review pursuant to F.S. § 380.06, shall be required to be consistent with the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Requirements. Developments meeting the following requirements shall be deemed to have statutory vesting pursuant to this section: 
(1)  Developments of regional impact for which a development order has been approved pursuant to F.S. § 380.06, prior to July 6, 1990, or prior to the date the city initiated the process to adopt a comprehensive plan amendment with which the development is inconsistent, to the extent that the development is consistent with and authorized by the terms and conditions of the development of regional impact (DRI) development order and the DRI development order is valid and unexpired. 
(2)  A development or approved phase of development, other than a development meeting the requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section, that otherwise complies with and is allowed to proceed under all laws, ordinances and regulations other than provisions of the comprehensive plan and the land development regulations adopted to implement the comprehensive plan with which it may be inconsistent, and which has been issued a final local development order and substantial development has commenced and is continuing in good faith such that it is covered by statutory vesting if it also meets the following criteria: 
a.  Structure. Any structure, not contained within a subdivision or planned unit development, for which: 
1.  A building permit was issued as of July 6, 1990, or prior to the date the city initiated the process to adopt a comprehensive plan amendment with which the development is inconsistent; 
2.  The building permit has not expired; 
3.  Construction pursuant to the building permit commenced before the permit expired; and 
4.  The structure is consistent with the applicable zoning regulations. 
b.  Subdivisions and commercial site plans. Any subdivision or phase of a subdivision for which: 
1.  A final local development order in the form of a final development plan and plat or a final site plan for a commercial development not subject to platting requirements and a building permit was approved and unexpired as of July 6, 1990, or on the date the city initiated the process to adopt a comprehensive plan amendment with which the subdivision is inconsistent; and 
2.  Construction pursuant to such final development order has started or is started before its expiration or July 6, 1990, whichever is earlier, or before the date on which the city initiated the process to adopt a comprehensive plan amendment with which the subdivision is inconsistent. 
c.  Planned unit developments. Any planned unit development or phase for which: 
1.  A final local development order in the form of a final development plan, site plan and building permit (all three required) was approved and unexpired as of July 6, 1990, or prior to the date the city initiated adoption of a comprehensive plan amendment with which the development is inconsistent; and 
2.  Construction pursuant to an approved final development plan, site plan and building permit (all three required) has started or is started before its expiration or July 6, 1990, whichever is earlier, or in the case of a comprehensive plan amendment with which the development is inconsistent prior to the date the city initiated adoption of the amendment, and development is continuing in good faith. 
In all cases, where a final development order has been approved for only a phase of a larger proposed development, statutory vesting applies only to the phase for which a final local development order has been issued and for which construction has commenced in accordance with the criteria in this subsection. 
(c)  Procedures for implementation of statutory vested rights. The procedures for implementation of statutory vested rights shall be as follows: Any development that meets the requirements for statutory vested rights under subsection (b)(1) or (2) of this section shall not have a development order or permit to complete the development withheld on the grounds of inconsistency with the comprehensive plan or new development regulations adopted to implement the comprehensive plan. The procedures for determination of whether such statutory vested rights apply are as follows: 
(1)  An applicant for such a development order or permit within a development the applicant believes is covered by statutory vested rights shall present to the director documentation showing that the requirements of subsection (b)(1) or (2) of this section are met. This documentation may be submitted prior to or simultaneously with the application for a development order or in accordance with section 62-37. 
(2)  If the official verifies that the requirements for statutory vesting are met, the application for development order or permit shall be processed consistent with the terms of this section and all other applicable city regulations. If the director cannot verify that the requirements for statutory vesting under subsection (b)(1) or (2) of this section are met based on the documentation submitted, the applicant shall be informed that the official cannot confirm that statutory vested rights apply to the development; and any development order or permit that is inconsistent with the land development regulations or the comprehensive plan cannot be issued. The applicant shall also be informed that if the applicant disagrees with the official's determination, the applicant may file an application for a statutory vested rights certificate in accordance with section 62-37. 
(Ord. No. 22-96, § 5, 8-27-1996) 
Sec. 62-36. - Equitable vested rights. 
(a)  A person with a valid legal or equitable interest in land may request from the city a determination of whether the person's right to complete a development on that land is vested pursuant to the common law doctrine of equitable estoppel, notwithstanding that all or some part of the development is inconsistent with a specified provision of the comprehensive plan or a new provision of the land development regulations that has been adopted to implement the comprehensive plan. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the person alleging equitable vested rights to demonstrate affirmatively the legal prerequisites of equitable vested rights based on the standards described in this section. If the standards for equitable vested rights are determined to be met, an equitable vested rights certificate shall be issued to confirm that the development may be completed despite the inconsistency of that development with the specified provision of the comprehensive plan or land development regulations adopted to implement the comprehensive plan. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create rights that otherwise do not exist including authorization of any action that would pose an imminent peril to the health and safety of the citizens of the city; and any development for which an equitable vested rights certificate is issued shall continue to be subject in all other respects to laws, ordinances, rules and regulations other than those covered by the equitable vested rights certificate. 
(b)  Developments for which an eligible applicant for an equitable vested rights certificate has relied in good faith upon some act or omission of the government and has made such a substantial change in position or incurred such extensive obligations and expenses that it would be highly inequitable and unjust to destroy the rights to develop or continue to develop the property shall be entitled to an equitable vested rights certificate. 
(c)  In assessing whether the requirements for equitable vested rights identified in subsection (b) of this section have been met, the following factors and guidelines shall be considered: 
(1)  Those factors and circumstances that have been identified in state case law addressing the common law doctrine of equitable estoppel; and 
(2)  Whether the obligations and expenses incurred can be substantially utilized in a development that is consistent with the comprehensive plan or land development regulations adopted to implement the plan so that it is not highly inequitable or unjust to require compliance with the comprehensive plan. 
(d)  The sole procedure for determining the existence of the equitable vested rights and obtaining an equitable vested rights certificate shall be as identified in section 62-37. 
(Ord. No. 22-96, § 6, 8-27-1996) 
Sec. 62-37. - Filing of application for statutory or equitable vested rights certificate and appeals. 
(a)  Authorized. Persons who believe they are entitled to a statutory vested rights certificate or an equitable vested rights certificate for a particular development may complete, execute and file an application for a statutory or equitable vested rights certificate with the city manager or such other person as the city manager may designate. The applicant shall simultaneously tender any application fee established by the city commission for review of such applications. 
(b)  Due date. The purpose for which statutory vested rights certificates or equitable vested rights certificates are issued is to provide certainty and predictability in the use and conveyance of land and interests in the land. There is no deadline, therefore, for applying for such certificates. However, after denial of a development order or denial of a certificate of level-of-service compliance, when the denial is based on inconsistency with the comprehensive plan or the land development regulations to implement the plan, it shall constitute an abandonment and waiver of any claim to statutory vested rights or equitable vested rights relative to that denial unless a notice of intention to file an application for a statutory vested rights certificate or equitable vested rights certificate is filed within 30 days of the date of denial and an application is subsequently filed within 45 days after the deadline for filing the notice of intention. 
(c)  Contents of application. The application shall contain information sufficient to enable a determination to be made whether the development is vested pursuant to either section 62-35 or section 62-36. The applicant may submit any relevant supporting information, including development orders and permits, acts of reliance on the city's development orders or other actions, or any other information upon which the application is based and a list of any development orders or permits denied on the grounds of inconsistency with the comprehensive plan or the land development regulations to implement the plan and the specific provision of the plan or new regulation to implement the plan that was the basis for the denial. The director may require the applicant to submit additional information to enable a determination to be made whether the development is vested. An incomplete or insufficient application shall be returned to the applicant for additional information. 
(d)  Verification by and continuing obligation of applicant. The applicant, or any agent or attorney for the applicant, shall verify the application in accordance with F.S. § 92.525(2) and sign a written declaration under penalty of perjury that the applicant has read the application and relevant supporting information and that the facts stated in it are true to the best of the applicant's knowledge and belief. Until the proceedings to grant or deny the application are final (including the time during which judicial appeals are pending), the applicant shall have a continuing obligation to correct any statement or representation found to have been incorrect when made or which becomes incorrect by virtue of changed circumstances. 
(e)  Report on application. 
(1)  The director shall review the application and any supporting or background information and shall consult with other city staff as necessary or desirable, including any city official who denied a development order or permit on the grounds of inconsistency with the comprehensive plan or land development regulations to implement the plan, and the city attorney, who shall provide counsel on issues of law. Within 30 days after receipt of a complete and sufficient application for a statutory vested rights certificate, and within 45 days after receipt of a complete and sufficient application for an equitable vested rights certificate, the director shall either grant the certificate or transmit in writing to the applicant the reasons for denial, including findings of fact and conclusions of law pertaining to the reasons for denial. The certificate may be issued with conditions or limitations. The decision shall be sent by U.S. mail, return receipt requested. 
(2)  If the applicant is aggrieved by the action of the director, the applicant may notify the director in writing of an appeal of the director's decision. The notification shall be delivered to the director no later than 30 days after the director renders a decision on the application; otherwise, the applicant shall be deemed to have waived all rights to challenge the decision. (For purposes of this section, the term "renders" means the date of signature on the return receipt card accompanying the decision. However, if the certified mail is not accepted or is returned, the term "renders" means ten calendar days after the date the decision was signed by the director.) The applicant shall also submit with the notification a list of the names and addresses of any witnesses whom the applicant shall present in support of the appeal and a summary of the testimony of each witness. Upon receipt by the director of a timely notice of appeal, the appeal shall be assigned to a hearing officer; and a hearing on the appeal shall be held in accordance with the provisions of section 62-38 on a date no later than 90 days after receipt of the notice or at such other date as the hearing officer and parties may find acceptable. The director shall file with the hearing officer the notice of appeal, information and a list of witnesses submitted by the applicant, any supporting or background information, and a written determination regarding the application. 
(3)  Nothing in this section or any other part of this article prohibits the director from reconsidering and reversing a denial of a statutory vested rights certificate or equitable vested rights certificate at any time prior to the start of the hearing before the hearing officer. 
(Ord. No. 22-96, § 7, 8-27-1996) 
Sec. 62-38. - Proceedings before hearing officers. 
(a)  Any proceedings requiring a decision by a hearing officer pursuant to this article shall be addressed in the manner provided in this section. 
(b)  The city shall appoint and retain hearing officers to hear appeals of decisions on applications for equitable vested rights certificates or applications for statutory vested rights certificates. Each of the hearing officers shall be a licensed attorney with The Florida Bar who has practiced law in the state for at least five years, and who has experience in land use law, local governmental law, or administrative law. None of the hearing officers or the law firms with which they may be associated shall represent clients before any agency of city government during the period in which they serve as hearing officers. 
(c)  Each hearing officer shall serve at the pleasure of the city commission and shall be compensated at a rate to be fixed by the city commission. 
(d)  No city employee, elected official or other person who is or may become a party to a vested rights proceeding before a hearing officer shall engage in ex parte communication with the hearing officer. This does not prohibit discussions between the hearing officer and other persons that pertain solely to scheduling of hearings and other administrative matters unrelated to the merits of the appeal. 
(e)  If a person engages in an ex parte communication with the hearing officer, the hearing officer shall place on the record of the pending case all ex parte written communications received, all written responses to such communications, a memorandum stating the substance of all oral communications received and all oral responses made, and shall advise all parties that such matters have been placed on the record. Any person desiring to rebut the ex parte communication shall be entitled to do so, but only if such party requests the opportunity for rebuttal within ten days after notice of such communication. If such person deems it necessary due to the effect of an ex parte communication received by the hearing officer, such person may withdraw from the case. 
(f)  Any person who makes an ex parte communication prohibited in subsection (d) of this section is acting in violation of this article and may be assessed a civil penalty not to exceed $500.00. 
(g)  A hearing officer, and any firm with which such officer is or may become associated, are prohibited for a period of three years after rendering a decision from acting as an agent or attorney for any person with a legal or equitable interest in the property that was the subject of the decision by the hearing officer, or on any matter involving property that was the subject of the decision by the hearing officer. 
(h)  All hearings shall be open to the public and shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation not less than 14 days prior to the date of the hearing. 
(i)  The participants before the hearing officer shall be the applicant, the applicant's witnesses, if any, city staff, interested members of the public, if any, and witnesses of the interested members of the public, if any. Any interested member of the public who participates at the hearing shall leave a mailing address with the hearing officer. 
(j)  The proceeding before the hearing officer shall be conducted as a quasi-judicial hearing. Testimony and evidence shall be limited to matters directly relating to application and development. Irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious testimony or evidence may be excluded. The applicant shall have the burden of establishing each element of the vested rights claim by substantial competent evidence. 
(k)  All testimony shall be under oath. The order of presentation of testimony and evidence shall be as follows: 
(1)  The applicant and the applicant's witnesses, if any. 
(2)  The director's summary of the application and the director's written report or recommendation, and other city witnesses. 
(3)  Any interested member of the public, if any, and witnesses, if any. 
(4)  Rebuttal by the applicant. 
(l)  To the maximum extent practicable, the hearings shall be informal. Reasonable cross examination of witnesses shall be permitted, but questioning shall be confined as closely as possible to the scope of direct testimony. The hearing officer may call and question witnesses or request additional evidence as necessary and appropriate. To that end, if during the hearing the hearing officer believes that any facts, claims or allegations necessitate review and response by either the applicant, staff or both, the hearing officer may order the hearing continued until a certain date. The hearing officer shall decide all questions of procedure and standing. 
(m)  The hearing officer shall render a written decision on the application within 30 days after a transcript of the hearing is available. The hearing officer's written decision shall set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which it is based. 
(n)  The application shall be granted, and a vested rights certificate shall be issued, if the applicant demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the applicant is entitled to the certificate sought under pertinent provisions of this article. 
(o)  The original of the hearing officer's written decision shall be filed with the director and the city clerk, and copies shall be mailed to the applicant and to any interested member of the public who participated at the hearing. 
(p)  The decision of the hearing officer shall be final, subject to judicial review. 
(Ord. No. 22-96, § 8, 8-27-1996) 
Sec. 62-39. - Judicial review. 
    Any person aggrieved by a decision of a hearing officer under this article may challenge the decision in the circuit court for the seventh judicial circuit, but only if the person participated at the hearing. If the aggrieved person decides to challenge the decision, such person shall file a petition for writ of certiorari with the clerk of the circuit court not later than 30 days after the decision of the hearing officer is filed with the city clerk. The record before the circuit court shall consist of the complete record of the proceedings before the hearing officer. Judicial review shall not be available under this article or otherwise unless the procedures set forth in this section have been exhausted. 
(Ord. No. 22-96, § 9, 8-27-1996) 
Sec. 62-40. - Vested rights certificate benefits only the owner. 
    Any vested rights certificate issued pursuant to this article shall inure only to the benefit of the landowner who applies for the certificate and may not be devised, conveyed, assigned or hypothecated. 
(Ord. No. 22-96, § 10, 8-27-1996) 
Sec. 62-41. - Suspension and revocation of vested rights certificate. 
(a)  Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, subject to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, an equitable vested rights or statutory vested rights certificate may be suspended or revoked upon a showing by the city of an imminent peril to the health and safety of the citizens of the city that did not exist or was unknown at the time the certificate was issued or at the time of the development order or act of the government on which the claim for vesting is based. In addition, an equitable vested rights or statutory vested rights certificate may be suspended or revoked upon a showing by the city that the certificate was issued based upon false, inaccurate, misleading or incomplete information. 
(b)  An equitable vested rights or statutory vested rights certificate issued pursuant to this article shall not be revoked prior to a hearing being held by the city commission. However, such certificate may be suspended prior to a hearing being held by the commission, provided the commission shall hold a hearing within 30 days after the suspension.

State Law reference- Communications Services Tax Simplification Law, F.S. ch. 202. 

Sec. 74-221. - Intent. 
(a)  It is the intent of the city to increase its local communications services tax rate as provided in Section 13, Enrolled CS/CS/SB 1878 by the 2001 Florida Legislature. Section 13, Enrolled CS/CS/SB 1878 provides that notwithstanding any provision of F.S. ch. 202 to the contrary, any municipality that has a local communications services tax conversion rate established under F.S. § 202.20 which is less than the maximum rate established under F.S. § 202.19, may by resolution or ordinance increase its rate up to the maximum rate established under F.S. § 202.19 with such increased rate to be effective October 1, 2001. For the period beginning on October 1, 2001, and ending September 30, 2002, the maximum rate established under F.S. § 202.19 is deemed to be the sum of such maximum rate plus the difference between the conversion rates set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of F.S. § 202.20(1). 
(b)  It is the further intent of the city to increase its local communications services tax rate effective October 1, 2002, as provided in F.S. § 202.19(2)(a) to the maximum rate of up to 5.1 percent for municipalities that choose not to levy permit fees.

    That the requirements for and collection of permit fees from any providers of communications services that use or occupy municipal roads or rights-of-way within the city is hereby repealed effective 11:59 p.m. on September 30, 2001. 
(Ord. No. 41-01, § 1, 6-16-2001) 
Sec. 74-223. - Increased local communications services tax rate. 
(a)  The local communications services tax conversion rate established under F.S. § 202.20(1)(a) for the city is 4.4 percent, which is less than the maximum rate of 5.5 percent as determined under the provisions of Section 13, Enrolled CS/CS/SB 1878. The local communications services tax rate for the city is increased to 5.5 percent during the period beginning on October 1, 2001, and ending September 30, 2002. As provided in Section 13, Enrolled CS/CS/SB 1878, this increased rate is to be effective October 1, 2001. 
(b)  The local communications services tax conversion rate established under F.S. § 202.20(1)(b) for the city is 4.0 percent, which is less than the maximum rate of 5.1 percent, as established in F.S. § 202.19(2)(a). The local communications services tax rate for the city is increased to 5.1 percent. This increased rate is to be effective October 1, 2002.

(c)  The annual adjustment to the stormwater utility fee using CPI shall be calculated as follows: 
(1)  The CPI to be used shall be the Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers - Not Seasonally Adjusted - All Items, as published by the United States Department of Labor for U.S. City Average. 
(2)  Multiply the percentage change of the CPI-U NSA from June 1 of the preceding calendar year through May 31 of the present calendar year times the existing annual equivalent drainage unit (EDU) stormwater utility fee. Add the result of this calculation to the existing stormwater utility EDU fee and round to the nearest dollar. 
(3)  In the event the calculations used to formulate the annual adjustment to the stormwater utility fee results in an increase to the fee of greater than three percent, then the annual adjustment to the stormwater fee shall be capped at three percent. 
(4)  In the event the calculations used to formulate the annual adjustment to the stormwater utility fee results in a decrease in the fee, then the previous year's stormwater utility fee shall be used.

Sec. 82-201. - Billing and payment; penalties. 
    Residential property, commercial property or any other property not exempt from ad valorem tax that contains impervious services shall be charged stormwater drainage utility fees using the non-ad valorem assessment method as outlined in F.S. ch. 197. 
    The stormwater drainage utility fee for all real property parcels that contain impervious surface and are exempt from ad valorem tax, including but not limited to schools (private/public), churches, and governmental property, shall be billed and at the city's discretion collected using one of the following methods: 
(1)  Using the non-ad valorem assessment method; 
(2)  A monthly bill from the utilities commission; 
(3)  A monthly bill from the city's finance department; 
(4)  Collected by the city's building department. 
    The stormwater drainage utility fee for all real property parcels that contain impervious surface and are not included on the non-ad valorem assessment roll for any fiscal year, shall be billed and collected either with a monthly utility bill or collected by a monthly bill from the city finance department or collected by the city building department through the building permit process. 
    Stormwater utility fees that are billed and collected separately as stormwater drainage utility fees by the city finance department shall be rendered monthly by the finance department and shall become due and payable in accordance with the rules and regulations of the finance department pertaining to the collection of the utility fees. 
    Stormwater utility fees that are billed and collected separately as stormwater drainage utility fees by the city building department shall be collected by the building department and shall become due and payable prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
    Stormwater utility fees that are billed and collected by the utilities commission shall be billed monthly by the utilities commission and shall be due on the date set by the utilities commission. A late charge shall be assessed for failure to pay the fee by the due date set by the utilities commission. The late fee shall be in the same amount charged by the utilities commission for non-payment of this or any other fees billed on the utility bill (standard utilities commission late fee). The utilities commission shall retain one percent of the total fees collected as payment for providing the collection services. 
    On or before July 1 of each year the city shall provide all information for the non-ad valorem assessment roll to the property appraiser that shall include all residential and commercial property that contain impervious structures or improvements. Any residential or commercial property that seeks a certificate of occupancy or any other type certificate of completion between June 1 and September 30 of each year, inclusive, shall be required, prior to the issuance of such certificate, to pay in advance the applicable fiscal year stormwater drainage utility fee prorated for the time remaining between the date of the certificate and September 30, inclusive, plus one full fiscal year or until the stormwater drainage fee is collected on the non-ad valorem assessment roll. any residential or commercial property that seeks a certificate of occupancy or any other type certification of completion between October 1 and the next ensuing September 30 inclusive shall be required, prior to the issuance of such certificate, to pay in advance the applicable fiscal year stormwater drainage utility fee prorated for the time remaining between the date of the certificate and the next ensuing September 30 inclusive. 
    Any charge due hereunder, if not paid when due, may be recovered in an action at law by the city. In addition to any other remedies or penalties provided by this or any other ordinance of the city, failure of any user of city utilities within the city to pay such charges promptly when due shall subject such user to discontinuance of utility services and the city manager of the city is hereby empowered and directed to enforce this provision as to any and all delinquent users. The employees of the city shall, at all reasonable times, have access to any premises served by the city for inspection, repair or the enforcement of the provisions of this article. 
    All stormwater drainage utility fees assessed pursuant to this article shall be a lien upon the property to which such fee is associated from the date such fee becomes due until such fee is paid. The owner of ever building, premises, lot or house shall be obligated to pay the fee for all service provided for his premises, which obligation may be enforced by the city or its agents by action at law or suit to enforce the lien. The lien against property owners billed monthly shall be enforced for failure to pay, through the same manner as foreclosure of mortgages and the lien against property owners billed annually on the non-ad valorem assessment bill shall be enforced for failure to pay through the same manner as a levy and ad valorem tax sale. In the event of such action, the city or its agents shall be entitled to recover all court costs and reasonable attorney fees for such collection. In the case that a tenant in possession of any premises or buildings shall pay such charges, it shall relieve the land owner from such obligation and lien; but the city shall not be required to look to any person whatsoever other than the owner for the payment of such charges. No changes of ownership or occupation shall affect the application of this article, and the failure of any owner to learn that he purchased property against which a lien for stormwater utility fees exists shall in no way affect his responsibility for such payment. 
(Ord. No. 93-95, § 6, 11-28-1995; Ord. No. 17-98, § 2, 6-23-1998; Ord. No. 32-10, § 1, 6-22-2010) 
Sec. 82-202. - Stormwater fee credits. 
(a)  The following stormwater fee credits shall be granted to property owners: 
(1)  Twenty-five-year storm event. There shall be a 25 percent credit on the stormwater utility fee for properties with stormwater systems that were designed and constructed, and are being maintained on site to completely retain the change in runoff volume caused by the development for the 25-year, 24-hour storm event. Owners of properties who qualify for this credit shall have their monthly stormwater utility fees reduced by 25 percent. 
(2)  One-hundred-year storm event. There shall be a 50 percent credit on the stormwater utility fee for properties with stormwater systems that were designed and constructed, and are being maintained on site to completely retain the change in runoff volume caused by the development for the 100-year, 24-hour storm event. Owners of properties who qualify for this credit shall have their monthly stormwater utility fees reduced by 50 percent. Owners of properties qualifying for the 100-year storm event credit shall not be eligible to receive a 25-year storm event credit as set forth in subsection (1) of this section. 
(b)  Eligibility for the credit. To qualify for a credit, the property owner must present reasonable proof to the city manager or his/her designee that the property owner is entitled to a credit. Reasonable proof shall include, but not be limited to, engineering calculations, prepared by an engineer registered in the state, demonstrating that the property qualifies for the credit. Condominium and homeowners' associations may make an application for all the members of the association. Any development that received a stormwater permit, constructed stormwater facilities that meet the requirements of the 25-year or 100-year storm event, and received a certificate of occupancy by the city on or after January 1, 1993, shall not be required to provide engineering calculations, prepared by an engineer registered in the state, demonstrating that the property qualifies for either a 25-year or a 100-year storm event credit. To remain eligible for either a 25-year or a 100-year storm event credit, the property owner must at all times maintain the stormwater management system in proper working order. Failure to maintain the stormwater management system in proper working order shall result in immediate termination of the credit. Property owners receiving a credit must reapply for the credit with the city manager on or before January 1 of the fifth calendar year following approval of the credit. (Example: If a property owner was approved for a credit on July 1, 1998, the first calendar year would be 1998, the second calendar year would be 1999, the third calendar year would be 2000, the fourth calendar year would be 2001, and the fifth calendar year would be 2002. The property owner would have to reapply for the credit on or before January 1, 2002.) Failure to timely reapply for the credit shall result in automatic termination of the credit. Property owners may file a reapplication for a stormwater credit up to six month prior to the date the property owner is required to reapply for the credit. If the property owner disputes the city's determination that the property owner has failed to apply for a credit or for some reason the property does not qualify for a credit, the property owner may appeal the city manager's decision to the city commission. The appeal must be filed with the city clerk within 30 days of the date on which the city manager mailed notice to the property owner that the city had determined that the property owner's property was not entitled to a credit or the credit automatically expired. Failure to timely file an appeal waives the property owner's right to appeal. Upon a timely appeal, the city commission shall schedule and hold a quasi-judicial public hearing on the appeal. The hearing shall be held within 30 days. The city commission's review on appeal shall be de novo. The property owner shall receive reasonable notice from the city clerk of the day, time, place and matters to be considered at the hearing. The property owner shall be given a fair opportunity to be heard, to present evidence, and to obtain compulsory attendance of witnesses and production of documents, and the right to cross examine adverse witnesses, and shall have the right to be represented by an attorney at the hearing at the property owner's expense. All testimony at the hearing shall be sworn and recorded. The city commission shall issue a final determination at the conclusion of the hearing and such determination shall be part of the official minutes of the city commission. Further appeals shall be as allowed by law.

(4)  The owner requesting the adjustment may be required, at the owner's own cost, to provide supplemental information to the director, including but not limited to survey data calculating impervious areas approved by a registered professional land surveyor (P.L.S.) and engineering reports approved by a professional engineer (P.E.). Failure to provide such information may result in the denial of the adjustment request. 
(5)  Adjustments to the utility fee will be made upon the granting of the adjustment request, in writing, by the director. Denials of adjustment requests shall be made, in writing, by the director. 
(b)  Upon receipt of the written denial of the adjustment request, the owner who initially requested the adjustment may, within 30 days of receipt of such denial, appeal to the city manager for review of the denial.

B.  A site plan or subdivision preliminary or final plat has been approved prior to the effective date of this ordinance. 
104.00. - Findings. 
    104.01. General findings. 
A.  F.S. ch. 163, requires the City of New Smyrna Beach to enact unified land development regulations which implements and is consistent with the city's comprehensive plan and which contains all land development regulations for the city. 
B.  Controlling the location, design and construction of development within the city is necessary to maintain and improve the quality of life within the city as more fully described below. 
C.  High quality development pays for itself. It provides necessary improvements, enhances the tax base, attracts other quality development and, in general, is an asset to the city. 
D.  Low quality development does not pay for itself. It overburdens existing improvements, adds little to the tax base, attracts other low quality development and, in general, is a liability to the city. 
    104.02. Specific findings. 
A.  Administration and enforcement. 
(1)  Land development administrative procedures under one cover promotes efficient development. 
(2)  All development proposals should undergo a development review process to assure compliance with the requirements of this LDR. 
(3)  Mandatory concept review allows developers to modify proposals in response to early citizen and staff comment. 
(4)  Developments having large potential impact on the environment and community should go through a more rigorous review process than others. 
(5)  Review of planning decisions should be independent of review of land development decisions to avoid ad hoc planning on a site-by-site basis. 
(6)  All administrative decisions should be supported by a record with written findings to assure accountability and efficient appellate review. 
(7)  A quick, efficient and nonpolitical avenue of appeal should be available for all administrative decisions. 
(8)  Enforcement of development orders and the provisions of this LDR should be through procedures that are efficient, effective and consistent with the LDR enforcement procedures established by state law. 
(9)  All developers should develop using the same administration and enforcement procedures. 
(10)  Development agencies and boards, permits and consistent enforcement procedures assure community developments that maintain or improve the quality of life within the city. 
(11)  Amendment and exception procedures assure quality development in a dynamic and imperfect setting. 
B.  Comprehensive plan consistency and concurrency. 
(1)  The city's comprehensive plan is a blueprint of future growth and was developed with input from the community. Developments consistent with the comprehensive plan express community desires. 
(2)  Concurrency is required to prevent public facilities from being overloaded and thus reducing the quality of life in the city. 
(3)  Concurrency will require development to pay for itself and relieve existing residents from the burden of paying for growth. 
C.  Improvement design standards. 
(1)  Right-of-way improvements. 
a.  Are costly to construct and maintain. 
b.  Should provide safe, adequate and aesthetically pleasing access to property. 
c.  Contribute greatly to stormwater runoff pollution if drainage systems are not constructed properly. 
d.  Provide a potentially hazardous situation for pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular traffic if not properly designed and constructed. 
(2)  Stormwater management. 
a.  Stormwater runoff erodes [land] and pollutes ground and surface water. 
b.  Stormwater runoff often contains nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, which adversely affect flora and fauna by accelerating eutrophication of receiving waters. 
c.  Erosion silts up water bodies, decreases their capacity to hold and transport water, interferes with navigation, and damages flora and fauna. 
d.  Installation of impervious surfaces increases the volume and rate of stormwater runoff and decreases groundwater recharge. 
e.  Improperly managed storm- water runoff increases the incidence and severity of flooding and endangers property and human life. 
f.  Improperly managed storm- water runoff alters the salinity of estuarine areas and diminishes their biological productivity. 
g.  Degradation of ground and surface waters imposes economic costs on the community. 
h.  Eighty to 95 percent of the total annual loading of most stormwater pollutants discharged into receiving waters are concentrated in the flush created by the first one inch of rainfall ("first flush"), and carried off-site in the first one-half inch of runoff. 
i.  Improperly managed storm- water adversely affects the drainage of surrounding property. 
(3)  Utilities. 
a.  Reliance on the city central potable water system reduces salt water intrusion associated with individual wells and package potable water treatment plants; 
b.  Reliance on the city central sewer system reduces pollution associated with septic tank and package wastewater treatment systems; 
c.  Underground utilities are much more aesthetically pleasing and cost less to maintain than overhead utilities; and 
d.  The utilities commission specifies the required sewer, water and electric power capacity for each development. 
(4)  Fire protection. 
a.  The amount of water required to extinguish a fire ("fire flow" is indicated in gallons per minute) varies with the size of a development; 
b.  Adequate access to a development must be available in order to provide sufficient fire protection; 
c.  Firewalls prevent a fire in one unit from easily spreading to another unit; 
d.  Adequate fire protection saves money for the property owner, the city, and the residents of the city; and 
e.  The ultimate fire protection goal is to prevent loss of life. 
(5)  [ Tree preservation and landscaping. ] Tree preservation and landscaping benefit the community by: 
a.  Absorbing carbon dioxide and returning oxygen to the atmosphere; 
b.  Precipitating dust and other particulates from the air; 
c.  Providing wildlife habitat, particularly for birds which in turn help control insects; 
d.  Providing soil stabilization which reduces erosion and mitigates the effect of flooding; 
e.  Providing shade which reduces energy consumption and glare and making outdoor areas more comfortable during the warm months; 
f.  Making the developed environment more attractive by adding a variety of color, shape and pattern and thus increasing community pride and the value of property; 
g.  Providing attractive buffering between incompatible land uses; 
h.  Abating noise; 
i.  Attracting higher quality developments into the community; and 
j.  Saving money for the property owner and the city in general. 
(6)  [ Native vegetation. ] Because native vegetation is adapted to local diseases, pests, soil and climate, it is generally more economical and desirable than exotic species which require more pesticide, fertilizer and water. 
(7)  [ Exotic vegetation. ] Exotic vegetation can crowd out native vegetation, uses more water, and damages the environment from increased use of fertilizers and pesticides. 
(8)  [ Beneficial trees. ] Because some trees are more beneficial than others, the public benefits of tree protection may be obtained without preserving each and every tree. 
(9)  [ Mangrove trees. ] Mangrove trees are especially valuable in stabilizing, building and protecting the shoreline, providing for spawning and breeding grounds for marine organisms and other wildlife, and serving as the basis for most of the estuarine food chains, which are critical to 70 to 90 percent of those species considered important from a recreational and/or commercial standpoint. 
(10)  Addressing and mail delivery. 
a.  Proper visibility of the property address is necessary for efficient police, fire and mail delivery service. 
(11)  Police protection. 
a.  Proper lighting of property is necessary to prevent vandalism, burglary and other mischievous acts; 
b.  Trees and shrubbery located in front of windows and doors aid criminals in wrongful entry to structures; and

(13)  Solid waste recycling. 
a.  Solid waste recycling is mandated by state statutes; 
b.  Solid waste recycling saves money by conserving the valuable natural and manpower resources used to produce goods; [and]; 
c.  Solid waste recycling reduces the cost of waste management by reducing dependence on landfill facilities. The cost to construct and operate a landfill facility runs in the millions of dollars per acre. 
(14)  Buildings. 
a.  Buildings constructed to proper standards protect the health of the general public particularly in times of natural or manmade disaster; and 
b.  Buildings constructed to proper standards maintain or enhance the value of property within the city and therefore enhance the welfare of the general public. 
(15)  Off-street parking and loading. 
a.  Some land uses require more parking spaces than other land uses; 
b.  The size of automobiles have varied throughout the years. During the late 1970's and early 1980's car sizes were generally reduced. During the mid and late 1980's, car sizes increased. Inadequate parking space and access aisle size results in damaged automobiles and injured persons; 
c.  Over-paving a site is unattractive and results in runoff pollution and flooding; and 
d.  Parking lots need to be designed for vehicular and pedestrian traffic. 
(16)  Permanent reference points. 
a.  Accurate subdivision of land is necessary to easily determine lot and block boundary lines so there is no question of ownership in the future. 
(17)  Sidewalk and bicycle facilities. 
a.  New Smyrna Beach is a beach and retirement community and thus has a large amount of bicycle and pedestrian traffic. 
b.  Sidewalk and bicycle facilities are needed to assure a safe separation between vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic. 
c.  The city averages approximately one pedestrian/vehicular accident per month. If more sidewalk and bicycle facilities were available, this rate would, most likely, be lower. 
d.  The city may be held liable in a pedestrian or bicycle/automobile accident for not providing adequate pedestrian or bicycle facilities. 
(18)  Signs. 
a.  The manner of the erection, location and maintenance of signs affects the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the people of this community. 
b.  The safety of motorists, cyclists, pedestrians, other users of the public streets, and property is affected by the number, size, location and appearance of signs that are intended to and result in the diversion of the attention of drivers. 
c.  The size and location of signs may, if uncontrolled, constitute an obstacle to effective firefighting techniques. 
d.  The construction, erection and maintenance of large signs suspended from or placed on the tops of buildings, walls or other structures may constitute a direct danger to pedestrian and vehicular traffic below, especially during periods of strong winds. 
e.  Uncontrolled and unlimited signs may degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the economic value of tourism, visitation and permanent economic growth. 
f.  It is therefore necessary for the promotion and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare of the people of this community that the erection, construction, location and maintenance of signs be regulated and controlled. 
g.  Large signs, flashing signs, or other signs specifically prohibited are prohibited because they distract traffic and thus create unsafe conditions for the general public. 
D.  Subdivision design. 
(1)  Aesthetically pleasing subdivision design attracts potential residents and thus increases the sale of lots and tax base; 
(2)  Lots with adequate dimensions, orientation and access are desirable and attractive to potential residents; and 
(3)  Subdivisions with adequate access are convenient and attractive to potential residents and safe in case of an emergency. 
E.  Flood zones. 
(1)  Flooding is a natural, recurring phenomenon in the city. 
(2)  Naturally floodprone lands serve the following important functions in the regional hydrologic cycle and ecological system because they: 
a.  Provide natural storage and conveyance of floodwaters; 
b.  Facilitate groundwater recharge; 
c.  Provide temporary storage of surface waters that moderates flood elevations and the timing, velocity and rate of flood discharges; 
d.  Reduce erosion, and filter nutrients, sediments, and other pollutants from floodwaters; and 
e.  Export detritus and other food sources to open water bodies and are vital habitat for fish, birds, wildlife and native plant communities. 
(3)  Naturally occurring flooding may provide recharge to groundwaters and a basic source of flow to surface waters. 
(4)  The uncontrolled development of floodprone lands substantially degrades the health, safety and welfare of the community in the following ways: 
a.  The owners, residents, customers, guests, and employees occupying homes, businesses and other structures located in floodprone areas are placed at unreasonable risk of personal injury and property damage; 
b.  Expensive and dangerous search, rescue and disaster relief operations may be necessary when developed properties are flooded; 
c.  Roads, public facilities, and utilities associated with development may be damaged by flooding at great expense to taxpayers and rate payers; 
d.  Flooding of developed properties may lead to demands that the government construct expensive and environmentally damaging projects to control floodwaters; 
e.  Normally floodfree lands are placed at risk of flooding when floodwaters on natural floodprone areas are obstructed, diverted, displaced or channelized by development; 
f.  Water quality is degraded, the supply of freshwater to estuaries is disrupted and habitat is lost; and 
g.  Property values are lowered and economic activity is disrupted by damaging floods. 
F.  Protection of environmentally sensitive lands. 
(1)  Protection of environmentally sensitive lands promotes the well being of the people of the city as described below and in the conservation element. 
(2)  The various types of protected environmentally sensitive areas serve the following beneficial functions: 
a.  Wetlands provide natural storage and conveyance of floodwaters, and minimize erosion and sedimentation by reducing flood flows and the velocity of floodwaters; 
b.  Coastal wetlands, and inland wetlands adjoining larger lakes and rivers protect wildlife and the shoreline from destructive wave action; 
c.  Wetlands filter and help decompose sediments, nutrients, and other natural and manmade pollutants that would otherwise degrade surface and ground waters; 
d.  Wetlands support commercial and recreational fishing because they provide essential nutrients and hatcheries for aquatic life; 
e.  Wetlands provide habitat for rare and endangered species, and provide essential breeding and protective habitats for many other birds, mammals, and reptiles; and 
f.  Wetlands supply ground and surface water. 
(3)  Agricultural and development activities have destroyed or impaired the beneficial functions of many environmentally sensitive lands in the city. 
(4)  Federal and state regulations do not adequately protect environmentally sensitive lands, thus making local regulation necessary. 
(5)  Considerable acreage of wetlands has been lost, and their important functions impaired, by draining, dredging, flooding, filling, excavating, building, polluting, and other acts. Remaining wetlands are in jeopardy of being lost or impaired by such acts. The loss of important wetland functions are contrary to the public health, safety, and welfare. 
G.  Protection of cultural resources. 
(1)  There are, located within the city, historical, architectural, and archeological districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that are unique and irreplaceable assets to the city. 
(2)  In recognition of these assets, the city has adopted a conservation element as part of its comprehensive plan. 
(3)  The conservation element of the comprehensive plan includes a survey of cultural resources which has been adopted as the official inventory of the historic resources of the city. 
(4)  The recognition, protection, enhancement and use of these resources are public purposes promoting the economic, educational, cultural and general welfare of the public by increasing property values, stabilizing neighborhoods and older areas of the city, increasing economic benefits to the city and its inhabitants, enriching human life in its educational and cultural dimensions, and fostering civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of the past. 
(5)  The city has for many years exerted efforts in an attempt to encourage redevelopment of the older parts of the city and continues to do so. 
(6)  It is the will of the Florida Legislature as expressed in F.S. ch. 267 that the state's historic sites and properties, buildings, artifacts, treasure troves, and objects of antiquity, which have scientific or historical value, or are of interest to the public, be protected and preserved. 
H.  Wellfield protection. Wellfield protection is needed to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare by providing for regulation of the storage, handling, use or production of hazardous substance within zones surrounding potable water supply wells thereby protecting the potable water supply from contamination.

304.00. - Permitting required prior to development. 
    [The following are the permitting required prior to development:] 
A.  General. Prior to any construction, remodeling, erecting, or any other work to any building, accessory or incidental structure, a building permit must be obtained. The exception to permitting requirements are any activities that do not require inspections as determined by the city building official. No building permit shall be issued by the building official unless in conformity with the provisions of this LDR. If a permit is denied, reasons for the denial shall be stated. 
B.  Concurrency evaluation. Prior to the approval of any site plan or subdivision, a concurrency evaluation (CE) must be issued by the city planner or his/her designee. A CE shall be issued only after a proposed project meets the concurrency test as indicated in article IV of this LDR. 
C.  Permit to construct required improvements. Once an applicant has approval to begin installing required improvements for a subdivision or site plan, a land clearing/water management (site construction) permit is required from the planning and engineering department. The following are the procedural requirements to obtain a land clearing/water management (site construction) permit: 
(1)  The land clearing/water management permit applicant must first receive a certificate of zoning (CZ) from the planning and engineering department. The CZ is obtained by providing the planning and engineering department two copies of the site plan or subdivision blue line prints. The planning and engineering department shall compare the planning and zoning board or city technical review staff approved prints with those submitted by the applicant. If the prints are identical, a CZ will be issued. If the prints do not match, then the applicant must change the prints to match the approved prints or apply for an amendment to the approved plans. 
(2)  Once a CZ is issued, the land clearing/water management Permit applicant must present the engineering department with five sets of subdivision or site plan improvement construction drawings, all permits required by any governmental agencies, a CZ, administration fee receipt, and any other items as required by the engineering department. A preconstruction meeting, coordinated by the engineering department, is then held. Upon a successful completion of a preconstruction meeting, the city engineer shall issue a land clearing/water management (site construction) permit. A land clearing/water management (site construction) permit shall expire one year from issuance. 
D.  Permit to construct building(s) or structure(s). Once an applicant has site plan approval or a subdivision improvement certificate of completion, a building permit is required prior to any building construction. The following are the procedural requirements to obtain a building permit: 
(1)  The building permit applicant must first receive a certificate of zoning (CZ) from the planning and zoning department. The CZ is obtained by providing the planning and zoning department two copies of an approved site plan. The site plan will be reviewed to determine consistency with the city land development regulations and the comprehensive plan. If the proposed construction is associated with a class II or III site plan, the two sets of plans will be compared to the previously approved site plan. If the site plans conform to the land development regulations and comprehensive plan, a CZ will be issued by the planning and zoning department. If the site plans do not conform to the land development regulations, no CZ shall be issued and the building permit application procedure shall stop. 
(2)  Once a CZ is obtained, the applicant must receive engineering approval. Engineering approval shall be in the form of a land clearing/water management (site construction) permit for all projects except single-family and duplex dwellings. A stormwater management permit is required for single-family and duplex dwellings and shall constitute engineering approval. 
(3)  Once a CZ and engineering approval is obtained, the applicant must apply for a building permit with the inspection department. In order to obtain the building permit, the applicant must present, to the inspection department, the following information: 
a.  Certificate of concurrency; 
b.  Certificate of zoning; 
c.  Engineering approval; 
d.  Receipts indicating that all utility and impact fees are paid; 
e.  Building plans and application package as required by the building official; and 
f.  Building permit fee receipt. 
Once a building permit is obtained, construction of the proposed building or structure may commence. 
(4)  A building permit[ee] may be allowed to construct model homes within a platted subdivision prior to the issuance of a certificate of completion if the fire marshal indicates, in writing, that adequate fire protection improvements are constructed and operational. 
E.  Certificates of zoning for new, altered, or nonconforming uses. It shall be unlawful to use or occupy or permit the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed, converted, or wholly or partially altered or enlarged in its use or structure, until a certificate of zoning has been issued by the city planner, or a person so designated by the city planner, stating that the proposed use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of this LDR. No permit for erection, alteration, moving or repair of any building, shall be issued until an application has been made for a certificate of zoning, and the certificate shall be issued in conformity with the provisions of this LDR upon completion of the work. A temporary certificate of zoning may be issued by the city planner for a period not exceeding six months during alterations or partial occupancy of a building pending its completion, provided that such temporary certificate may include such conditions and safeguards as will protect the safety of the occupants and the public. The city planner shall maintain a record of all certificates of zoning, and a copy shall be furnished upon request to any person. Failure to obtain a certificate of zoning shall be a violation of this LDR and punishable under this LDR. A CZ shall expire within six months of the day of issuance unless a building permit or occupational license has been issued. An additional CZ shall be required if an additional building permit is required. 
F.  Expiration of building permit. If the work described in any building permit has not begun within six months from the date of issuance there of, the permit shall automatically expire. If there has not been substantial performance of the work described in any building permit within two years of the date of issuance thereof, said permit shall expire and be canceled by the enforcement official, and written notice thereof shall be given to the persons affected, together with notice that further work as described in the canceled permit shall not proceed unless, and until, a new building permit has been obtained. Substantial performance would require the holder of the permit to have, in good faith, complied with the requirements of the permits and development orders, and have substantially done so. Substantial performance is defined by one of the following: 
(1)  During the two-year period, substantial performance associated with a Class I site plan review shall have been accomplished when all of the essential components necessary to allow issuance of a certificate of occupancy or certificate of completion have been constructed or installed. Exemptions may be allowed for slight and unintentional defects which can be readily remedied. 
(2)  During the two-year period, substantial performance associated with a Class II or Class III site plan review shall have been accomplished when the exterior envelope of the structure has been completed. 
G.  Construction and use to remain the same. Building permits or certificates of zoning issued on the basis of plans and applications approved by the building official and the city planner, or a person so designated by the city planner, authorize only the use, arrangement and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications, and no other use, arrangement, or construction. Use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized, shall be deemed a violation of this LDR, and punishable as provided in section 304.00 J. of this LDR. 
H.  Buildings under construction, outstanding permits. Any building or structure for which a building permit has been issued, and the construction of which has started prior to the adoption of this LDR, may be completed in accordance with the plans and specifications as outlined in the building permit, provided all construction is completed within one year after the effective date of this LDR. Where, at the adoption of this LDR, there are outstanding valid building permits, authorizing the construction of buildings, structures, additions, or alterations, the use of construction of which do not conform to the requirements of this LDR, such permits shall be void unless actual construction work, excluding grading or excavation is underway within 60 days of the effective date of this LDR. When, at the adoption of this LDR, there are outstanding valid building permits authorizing the use of land or buildings without construction work, and where such use is not permissible under the terms of this LDR, such permit shall be void unless the use is actually in operation on that date. 
I.  Certificate of occupancy. No building shall be occupied, no business shall be operated out of any building or structure, and no home shall be lived in, until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the building official. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued by the building official for an individual building or structure until all required improvements needed to serve the building or structure are completely constructed, operational and approved by the city officials. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued by the building official for any homes within a subdivision until all amenities proposed in the subdivision are completed. As an exception, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued prior to completing amenities for model homes for the purpose of walk-through tours and not habitation. 
J.  Penalties. Any person, firm, or corporation, who violates any provisions of the LDR, or any lawful order of the city commission, planning and zoning board, or enforcement official, pursuant thereto, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $300.00 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 60 days, or both. Each day during which such violation shall be permitted to exist shall be deemed a separate offense. In addition, nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

(8)  When the city commission has taken action on a petition for a special exception, and, as a result of said action, the applicant fails to obtain approval of the requested special exception, the city commission may again consider the same requested special exception for a period of one year from the date of such action. Administrative res judicata shall not apply. 
(9)  Any building use which is allowed at a location by special exception approval may be added onto without another special exception approval provided the addition or additions comprise less than 20 percent of the floor area (of all floors) of the building as of the effective date of this ordinance or the addition is no greater than 1,500 square feet. This section shall not be construed to allow piecemeal construction to avoid special exception approval (e.g. if one addition is 15 percent of the building floor area as of the effective date of this ordinance and a second addition is ten percent of the building floor area as of the effective date of this ordinance then special exception approval is required for the second addition and any subsequent additions but not the first addition. 
    305.05. Variance. The following are the procedural requirements to obtain a variance from the land development regulations: 
A.  Preapplication meeting. Any person wishing to obtain a variance from the land development regulations must meet with the planning manager or his/her designee prior to submitting an application package with the planning and zoning department. The purpose of the preapplication meeting is to determine if a variance could be granted, to acquaint the applicant with the procedures to obtain a variance, and to acquaint the planning manager with the proposed variance. 
B.  Application procedures. After the preapplication meeting and prior to the cutoff date as indicated on the official planning and zoning board meeting schedule, the applicant shall submit, to the planning and engineering department, a completed variance application package. The application package shall consist of the following: 
(1)  Completed application form; 
(2)  Receipt of application fee payment; 
(3)  Copy of survey showing proposed activity; 
(4)  Legal description; 
(5)  List of names and addresses of property owners within 150 feet of the affected property. List must be provided by the Volusia County Property Appraiser's Office; 
(6)  Tax number of the property; 
(7)  Plot plan or site plan, drawn to scale, indicating present and proposed structures; 
(8)  Certification from landowner of record that applicant has authorization to make application for the requested variance (if applicant and landowner are not the same); and 
(9)  Letter of response from the applicant to the planning manager addressing the following: 
(a)  Special circumstances exist which are peculiar to the applicant's land, structure, or building, and do not generally apply to the neighboring lands, structures, or buildings, in the same district or vicinity. 
(b)  Strict application of the provisions of this LDR would deprive the applicant of reasonable rights commonly applicable to other properties in the same district or may preclude a benefit to the community in general. 
(c)  The special circumstances and conditions do not result from the actions of the applicant. 
(d)  That granting of the variance will not cause substantial detriment to the public welfare or impair the purposes and intent of this LDR. 
(e)  That granting of the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege that is denied by this LDR to other lands, structures, or buildings, in the same district. 
C.  Review process. 
(1)  Upon receipt of a completed application package in the planning and engineering department before the cutoff date as indicated on the official planning and zoning board meeting schedule, the planning manager shall review the application package for consistency with the city comprehensive plan and land development regulations. In addition, the planning manager shall determine whether the following criteria for granting a variance have been met: 
(a)  Special circumstances exist which are peculiar to the subject property owner's land, structure, or building, and do not generally apply to the neighboring lands, structures, or buildings, in the same district or vicinity. 
(b)  Strict application of the provisions of this LDR would deprive the subject property owner of reasonable rights commonly applicable to other properties in the same district or may preclude a benefit to the community in general. 
(c)  The special circumstances and conditions exist that do not result from the direct or indirect actions of the present property owner(s) or past property owner(s). This criterion shall not be satisfied if the present or past property owner created, to any degree, the hardship that is the subject of the variance request. 
(d)  That granting of the variance will not cause substantial detriment to the public welfare or impair the purposes and intent of this LDR. 
(e)  That granting of the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege that is denied by this LDR to other lands, structures, or buildings, in the same district. 
The planning manager shall then, in a written report, make a recommendation to the planning and zoning board to unconditionally approve, conditionally approve, or deny the requested variance. 
(2)  Upon receipt of the planning manager's written recommendation, the planning and zoning board shall review the request and the planning manager's report and recommendation. The planning and zoning board shall determine if the requested variance conforms to the comprehensive plan, land development regulations and criteria listed in [sub]section 305.05C.(1) above. The planning and zoning board shall either unconditionally approve, conditionally approve, or deny, the requested variance. The planning and zoning board shall only approve a variance if the request is consistent with the comprehensive plan, land development regulations, and criteria [listed in subsections] (a)-(e) above. The planning and zoning board may attach any conditions and safeguards it deems necessary or desirable in furthering the purpose of this LDR. Violations of the conditions or safeguards shall void the variance and be deemed a violation of this LDR. 
D.  Supplementary. 
(1)  Financial disadvantages to the property owner shall not constitute conclusive proof of unnecessary hardship within the purpose of zoning. 
(2)  The planning and zoning board does not possess the power to grant a variance permitting a use of land or building that is not permitted as a principal use or structure or accessory use or structure, in the district involved. 
(3)  Unless otherwise specified at the time the variance is granted, the variance applies to the subject property and not to the individual who applied. Consequently, the variance is transferable to any future owner of the subject property, but cannot be transferred by the applicant to a different site. 
(4)  A variance applies for an indefinite period of time unless otherwise specified at the time the variance is granted. If an expiration time is designated, the applicant may request one extension of one year from the expiration date. 
(5)  Applications for variances shall be signed by the applicant on forms prescribed by the planning and engineering department and delivered to the planning and engineering department with the remaining application package. 
(6)  No application package shall be accepted unless and until completed and containing all items as indicated in [sub]section 305.05B. of this LDR. 
(7)  The planning and zoning board shall schedule a public hearing for the next available meeting date from the receipt of the application. The city clerk shall prepare and deliver the notice of public hearing to the local newspapers. The applicant shall notice all property owners whose property is within 150 feet of the property involving the variance request. Such notification shall be sent certified mail "return receipt requested" at least 15 days prior to the public hearing. The public notice advertisement cost presented in the newspaper, together with the certified mail costs notifying property owners, shall be borne by the applicant. A list of property owner names and addresses for properties within 150 feet of the property involving the variance request, together with copies of the certified mail return receipts, shall be provided to the planning and engineering department secretary two days before the public hearing. In the event the receipts have not been received by the applicant so they can be given to the planning and engineering department secretary, the applicant, as an alternative may provide the secretary with a notarized affidavit indicating that all property owners within 150 feet of the subject property were notified. Should a condominium be located within the 150 feet, the condominium association or condominium manager shall be notified and the association manager shall notify the individual condominium owners. The planning manager or his/her designee shall also post notice on the property involving the variance request for a period of one calendar week prior to the hearing. 
(8)  The decision by the planning and zoning board relating to the application for a variance shall become final 15 days from the date the board renders its decision, unless the 15th day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which event, the decision of the board shall become final the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. 
(9)  When the planning and zoning board has taken action on a petition for a variance, and, as a result of said action, the applicant fails to obtain approval of the requested variance, the board may again consider the same requested variance for a period of one year from the date of such action. Administrative res judicata shall not apply. 
E.  Administrative variances. The following are the procedural requirements to obtain an administrative variance from the land development regulations: 
(1)  Pre-application meeting. Any person wishing to obtain an administrative variance from the land development regulations must meet with the planning manager or his/her designee prior to submitting an application package with the planning and engineering department. The purpose of the pre-application meeting is to determine if an administrative variance could be granted, or if a standard variance request would be required. 
(2)  Application procedures. The application package shall consist of the following: 
(a)  Completed application form; 
(b)  Receipt of application fee payment; 
(c)  Survey less than two years old showing existing improvements and proposed activity; 
(d)  Legal description; 
(e)  Tax ID number; 
(f)  Certification from landowner of record that applicant has authorization to make application for the requested administrative variance (if applicant and landowner are not the same); and 
(g)  Letter outlining request and explaining hardship. 
(3)  Review process. 
(a)  Upon receipt of a completed application package in the planning and engineering department the planning manager or his/her designee shall review the application package for consistency with the city comprehensive plan and land development regulations. In addition, the planning manager or his/her designee shall determine whether the following criteria for granting an administrative variance have been met: 
i.  The applicant has demonstrated that a hardship related to the land or structure exists. Economic considerations shall not be a reason to justify granting a variance. 
ii.  The request does not exceed ten percent of the required setback. 
iii.  Special circumstances exist which are peculiar to the subject property owner's land, structure, or building, and do not generally apply to the neighboring lands, structures, or buildings, in the same district or vicinity. 
iv.  Strict application of the provisions of this LDR would deprive the subject property owner of reasonable rights commonly applicable to other properties in the same district or may preclude a benefit to the community in general. 
v.  The special circumstances and conditions exist that do not result from the direct or indirect actions of the present property owner(s) or past property owner(s). This criterion shall not be satisfied if the present or past property owner created, to any degree, the hardship that is the subject of the variance request. 
vi.  That granting of the variance will not cause substantial detriment to the public welfare or impair the purposes and intent of this ordinance. 
vii.  That granting of the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege that is denied by this ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district. 
If the planning manager or his/her designee determines the applicant has demonstrated a hardship that would justify granting an administrative variance, the planning manager or his/her designee shall then approve the administrative variance request and provide the applicant with a written letter of approval. If the administrative variance is denied, the applicant can appeal the decision to the planning and zoning board. The administrative variance fee will be applied to the cost of the regular variance application. 
    305.06. Annexations. The following sections set forth the procedural requirements to annex property into the City of New Smyrna Beach: 
A.  Preapplication meeting. Any person proposing to voluntarily annex property into the city must meet with the city planner prior to submitting an application. The purpose of the preapplication meeting is to acquaint the applicant with the annexation procedures and to inform the city about the property to be annexed. 
B.  Application for annexation. The application for annexation shall include the items listed below and provide any other information material to the annexation decision: 
(1)  A petition for annexation signed by all owners of the property to be annexed.

ARTICLE IV. - CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

401.00. - General provisions. 
    401.01. Intent. 
A.  The city commission finds that the safe, convenient, and orderly flow of vehicular traffic; availability of adequate, convenient and accessible park and recreational facilities; availability of safe and adequate supplies of potable water, capacities of wastewater treatment facilities capability of solid waste collection, stormwater management systems and retention facilities; and availability of adequate school capacity to support strong and healthy schools are necessary for the health, safety, welfare, economic order, aesthetics, and convenience of the public. Hereafter, these infrastructure needs shall be referred to as public facilities and services. It is the intent of this article to ensure that public facilities and services are concurrent with the impacts of development and meet the levels of service set in the comprehensive plan so as to provide safe, convenient, and orderly services. Further, this article is intended to implement the goals, objectives, and policies of the comprehensive plan. The city commission finds that the safe, convenient, and orderly furnishing of public facilities and services will be achieved by the standards set forth herein and that, by adopting the standards contained in this article, the city is committed to adhere to and implement the requirements of the comprehensive plan. 
B.  The concurrency/development order evaluation shall measure the potential impact of any proposed project or expansion occurring to an existing project for which a development order is required based upon the established minimum acceptable level of service for public facilities and services. The most current available information and data regarding level of service for the above public facilities and services shall be utilized for concurrency/development order evaluations. No development order shall be approved unless adequate public facilities and services are available as determined by the concurrency/development order evaluation, and are consistent with the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
    401.02. Vested rights. The following developments are hereby determined to be vested for the purpose of this article: 
A.  Physical on-site construction if a building permit has been issued and it is valid on the effective date of this article. 
B.  Applications for site plans, tendered on or before the effective date of this article, shall be vested for a period of two years from the approval date. Any amendments or modifications to said site plans shall hereafter be required to have a concurrency/development order review under the provisions of this article. 
C.  Subdivision preliminary plats or subdivision final plats approved on or before the effective date of this article shall be vested through January 31, 1996. Thereafter, any and all of the lots platted in said subdivision shall be required to have a concurrency/development order review in accordance with this article. Any amendments or modifications to said plats shall hereafter be required to have a concurrency review under the provisions of this article. 
D.  Any subdivision which has received sketch plat approval on or before the effective date of this article shall have six months from the effective date of this article, or one year from the date of approval, whichever date is later, to obtain preliminary plat approval and shall have one additional year from the date of preliminary plat approval to obtain final plat approval. Thereafter, said project shall be required to have a concurrency/development order review in accordance with this article. 
E.  The city planner shall choose and develop a methodology for informing owners of above described vested properties under this section of the expiration of said vested rights under this section. Such methodology may include, but not be limited to, newspaper notice, individual notice or notice in the public records. Once that methodology is chosen, the city planner shall proceed to implement such methodology. 
    401.03. Applicability. 
A.  Generally. Unless otherwise provided, this article shall apply to all development orders. 
B.  Previously approved development orders. 
(1)  Existing use. Any application for a development order on a parcel of land which is presently occupied, using and generating needs for public facilities and services shall be subject to this article to the extent public facilities and services exceed public facilities and services associated with the existing use. 
(2)  Amendments to development orders. Any application for an amendment to a development order issued after the effective date of this article shall be subject to the requirements in this section for all public facilities and services generated by the portion of the project approved after the effective date of this article unless the proposed project would result in no increase in public facilities and services. 
    401.04. Application for concurrency/development order evaluation. Obtain an application in the planning and zoning department and complete the information requested. For all projects, including deminimus projects, submit copies of site plan I, II, or III, as applicable, subdivision preliminary plats or subdivision final plats in accordance with article III of this LDR. 
    401.05. Concurrency/development order review. 
A.  Concurrency/development order evaluation finding of non-deficiency. A finding of non-deficiency by a concurrency/development order evaluation for public facilities and services as set forth in this article shall remain valid until such time as final action is taken by the local planning agency (LPA) for those projects requiring LPA action. De minimus projects are not subject to LPA or PRC review and are approved by the city planner noting that all public facilities and services are non-deficient. Once a development order has been issued, the concurrency/development order evaluation finding of non-deficiency shall remain valid and in force for the following prescribed timeframes: 
(1)  For a development order granting approval for a site plan the finding shall remain valid until the development order expires, except where the intensity or density is increased from that considered as part of the concurrency/development order evaluation. Any increase in intensity or density shall require a new concurrency/development order evaluation for the proposed project. 
(2)  For a development order granting subdivision final plat approval, or for a phase or unit thereof, the finding shall remain valid for a period not to exceed 36 months from the date of final plat approval, provided that development orders are obtained for structures to be built on the following schedule: 
a.  Ten percent of the lots or units in the project within the first 12 months; 
b.  An additional 40 percent of the lots or units in the project within the first 24 months after approval of the final plat; 
c.  One hundred percent of the lots or units within the 36-month period; 
d.  The construction authorized by each development order is diligently pursued to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy; and 
e.  That the development orders are not permitted to expire. 
(3)  For de minimus projects, the finding shall remain valid for six months. 
(4)  If a developer's agreement with the city as provided in section 409.00 herein is utilized, a concurrency/development order evaluation shall be conducted as a component of a developer's agreement, and if concurrency is found or guaranteed, the timeframe for the finding's validity shall be as set forth in [sub]section 401.05A. and referenced in the agreement. 
B.  Expiration of concurrency/development order evaluation finding of nondeficiency. Where any of the applicable timeframes, as set forth in [subsection] 401.05A. for a particular project expire, a new concurrency/development order evaluation shall be required prior to the applicant submitting an application for the next development order. Any vesting period relating to concurrency may be considered void if the applicant fails to timely perform all requirements to keep the vesting current, including the payment of all fees pursuant to a capacity reservation for a particular public facility or service. If the applicant maintains a capacity reservation on a first come, first serve basis for a particular public facility or service, as set forth in subsection 401.05F. hereafter the expiration of the concurrency evaluation finding of nondeficiency shall not nullify said capacity reservation. 
C.  Cumulative records of level of service. 
(1)  The concurrency/development order evaluation system shall require maintenance of a cumulative record, of the traffic determined to be generated by a proposed project and potable water, sanitary sewerage, solid waste, stormwater management system and retention capacity, and parks and recreation capacity, all determined to be necessary to support all proposed projects. These capacity figures, the need for which has been generated by the approval of a concurrency/development order evaluation finding of nondeficiency as set forth in subsection 401.05A., shall be subtracted from the existing capacity of each public facility and service. The Volusia County School District shall be responsible for tracking permanent capacity in public school facilities. 
(2)  Upon the expiration of a concurrency evaluation finding of nondeficiency for a proposed project that has not been constructed, or is deemed by the city planner to have been abandoned by the applicant, the capacity allocated to that proposed project or portion thereof for a particular public facility and service, in relation to the overall existing capacity, shall be deleted or "backed-out" of the particular public facilities or services used, reserved, allocated, or unavailable capacity. Said deleted or "backed-out" capacity shall be available for use, reservation, or allocation to other proposed projects on a first come, first serve basis. 
D.  Operating procedures, systems and tasks. 
(1)  Procedures for monitoring. 
a.  In order to monitor the cumulative effect on the capacity of public facilities, a determination of capacity shall be performed for development orders that are exempted as set forth in subsection 401.05D.(2). All allocations of facility capacity from vested projects and exempted projects shall be subtracted from the remaining capacity available. The results of these calculations shall be the available capacity for new development orders for the next calendar year. Facility capacity shall be monitored at least on an annual basis. The extent of the remaining capacity available for each calendar year shall be made available to the general public before the start of the calendar year. The procedure for determining and monitoring public school facilities concurrency shall be as set forth in section 408.00 of this LDR. 
b.  Facility capacity shall be allocated to vested projects based on the amount such vested projects are likely to need on an annual basis for a given calendar year. This allocation shall be based on the vested project's historical building patterns over recent years. If no such historical record or pattern can be determined for such vested projects, then the allocation shall be computed by the amount of construction activity remaining to be built in such project divided by either the number of years specified in the approved development order(s) agreement(s), or the remaining years left in the vesting period. 
(2)  Exemptions. The following development orders are exempted and may commence development without a certificate of capacity: 
a.  Development that is vested pursuant to [sub]section 401.02 of this article; 
b.  Construction of public facilities that are identified in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan; 
c.  An alteration of development otherwise exempt under this LDR which does not create additional impact on public facilities; 
d.  The construction of accessory building and structures which do not create additional impact on public facilities; 
e.  The replacement of an existing dwelling unit when no additional units are created; 
f.  Room additions to residences, including but not limited to, screen rooms; 
g.  Signs; 
h.  Public school facilities are exempt, but ancillary facilities such as administrative, transportation, and maintenance facilities are not exempt; 
i.  Application for tree permit in accordance with Tree Ordinance No. 81-88; 
j.  Application for a wellfield protection permit; 
k.  Application for a wetland alteration permit; 
l.  Health care facilities to be constructed to meet the obligation to furnish health care services to indigents and residents of the districts and authorities created by the special Legislative acts creating the independent special taxing districts to the extent that such construction is authorized by the special acts as they may be amended; and 
m.  Fire or rescue facilities of any independent special taxing district, which provides fire and rescue services. 
(3)  Extraterritorial effects. In conducting any concurrency/development evaluation for a proposed project, the city shall consider impacts on public facilities. However, the city shall not consider impacts of a proposed project occurring outside the city's corporate limits, unless the city shall have entered into an interlocal agreement with the local governmental entity having jurisdiction over the area the proposed project impacts, as determined by this article. The interlocal agreement shall require the permitting local government to consider the impacts as defined in the interlocal agreement of proposed projects on public facilities and services within the jurisdictional limits of the nonpermitting local governmental unit that is a party to the interlocal agreement. The public facility and service level of service as set in the permitting local government's comprehensive plan shall be the level of service standard used for concurrency/development order evaluation within the nonpermitting local government jurisdictional limits. The extra-territorial impacts on public school facilities concurrency shall be as set forth in section 408.00 of this LDR. 
E.  Conditional approval of development orders. If the concurrency/development order evaluation indicates that the potential impact of issuing a development order for a proposed site plan or subdivision, will cause a deficiency to occur to an established minimum level of service, or temporarily acceptable minimum level of service, the city may conditionally approve the development order upon the availability of adequate capacity to serve the impact of the proposed projects. 
(1)  Nonfinal development orders. Development orders other than final development orders may be approved if a deficient public facility or service improvement based on the established acceptable levels of service will have sufficient capacity available to accommodate the impact of the proposed project and is contained in the city capital improvements element, or the capital improvements elements of other governmental agencies. 
(2)  Final development order. For the purpose of concurrency/development order evaluation, and unless otherwise provided herein, a final development order may be approved if the necessary public facilities and services are available so as to maintain minimum acceptable levels of service. 
F.  First come/first serve rule. 
(1)  If the city planner determines that the grant of a development order for a project would violate this article because of the circumstances identified hereafter, the applicant may request the project application be placed on awaiting list for reservation of capacity for all public facilities and services affecting the project. 
a.  An affected roadway or link is operating below the level of service set by the comprehensive plan and the transportation impacts generated by the project could not be handled by the link(s) or local roads affected by the project; 
b.  Wastewater treatment facility, park and recreation, drainage retention and stormwater management system, solid waste disposal facility, public school facilities capacity, or potable water capacities are not available to adequately serve the proposed project such that said public facilities and services will operate at or above the level of service set by the comprehensive plan after impacts generated by the project occur; 
c.  The city planner's determination is not to grant a development order and this determination is not overturned on an appeal pursuant to the appeals section hereof; 
d.  No other provision in this LDR is applicable to permit the proposed project to receive a nonfinal development order. 
(2)  Simultaneous with the applicant's request to be placed on a reservation list, the applicant shall be required to pay a fee to be fixed as part of a schedule by resolution of the city commission to reserve priority over subsequent applications which are served by the same public facilities and services. Said reservation shall be valid from the date that the application is filed and the fee paid until December 31 of the same year. To keep a reservation of capacity for a project current, a request for renewal of the reservation must be filed by no later than January 31 of the year for which the reservation is being renewed. The request for renewal shall be accompanied by a fee to be fixed as part of a schedule adopted by resolution of the city commission, and the project reservation of capacity may be renewed in like fashion for each succeeding year thereafter, until such time as a letter of determination of concurrency nondeficiency can be issued for all affected public facilities and services. The failure to renew the reservation of capacity by January 31 of any one year shall immediately and automatically invalidate the reservation, and the project's reservation of capacity shall be immediately removed from the waiting list. All applications for reservation of capacity shall then advance forward. The reservation of capacity shall run with the parcel of land and shall be transferable from the original applicant to subsequent land owners and developers of the same parcel of land. Under no circumstances may a reservation of capacity be transferred from one parcel of land to another or be amended to include a different parcel of land, or portion thereof, not originally subject to the capacity reservation. 
G.  Conditions. All development orders shall contain such conditions as are necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
    401.06. Application review by city planner. The city planner shall review the concurrency/development order evaluation application, except that the Volusia County School District shall review the application for public school facilities concurrency. Applications for public school facilities concurrency shall be reviewed according to the procedures set forth in section 408.00 of this LDR. The city planner shall determine if the proposed project complies with this article or the information submitted is insufficient to make this determination. A conclusion that such information is insufficient shall include a request for the specific information needed. This type of finding shall not be a final determination of an application for a concurrency/development order evaluation. 
A.  Determinations of the city planner. Determinations of the city planner must be in writing and any denial shall state the reasons. Within 20 working days of receipt of the study, the city planner, shall issue a rendition letter concluding one of the following: 
(1)  The proposed project does not violate the level of service and concurrency standards of this article; or 
(2)  The proposed project does not meet the requirements of this article, including the detailed reasons for this conclusion. 
B.  Additional information. Within 30 days of receipt of any letter from the city planner requesting additional information, the person submitting the concurrency/development order evaluation application and any traffic study or other data shall either: 
(1)  Submit the additional information; or 
(2)  Notify the city planner in writing that the requested additional information will not be submitted. Within 30 working days of receipt of any additional information or notification that no additional information will be submitted, the city planner shall issue a rendition letter pursuant to subsection 401.0B.(1) above. Any subsequent request for additional information shall be limited only to information needed to clarify the additional information or answer new questions raised by, or directly related to, the additional information. 
C.  Determination of noncompliance. Within 20 days of the rendition letter containing a final determination and stating the proposed project does not meet the requirements of this article, the person submitting the study may submit additional information addressing the reasons listed in the city planner's rendition letter or may appeal the city planner's determination pursuant to [sub]section 401.08. If additional information is provided, the city planner, shall, within 30 working days of receipt of the additional information, issue a new determination stating that the proposed project meets the requirements of this article or detailing the reasons why the proposed project does not meet the requirements of this article. This new determination letter is appealable within 20 calendar days of the date of rendition pursuant to [sub]section 401.08. 
D.  Determination where insufficient information. If the person submitting the study has notified the city planner that no additional information will be provided pursuant hereto, and the city planner then issued a rendition letter that the information submitted is insufficient for the city planner to determine the proposed project's compliance with this article or that the proposed project does not meet the requirements of this article, the person submitting the study may within 20 days of the city planner's rendition letter of determination, appeal said determination pursuant to [sub]section 401.08 of this article. 
E.  Extension of time. Excepting the limits for appeal, the time limits contained herein may be extended for good cause shown by the applicant with the mutual consent in writing of the city planner and the person submitting the request for determination. 
F.  Professional services. Any study, data, or other information, determined by the city planner to be of a technical nature, submitted by an applicant or person other than the city, must be prepared and signed by a qualified professional planner or registered professional civil engineer. 
    401.07. De minimus project review. A de minimus project is the development of any land use generating fewer than 101 trips per day after the effective date of the land development regulations, as indicated in the ITE Manual. However, for the purpose of public school facilities concurrency, the de minimum standards set forth in section 408.00 shall apply. Any de minimus project shall be reviewed by filing an application meeting the requirements of [sub]section 401.04 hereof. The project application, if completed in proper form, shall be approved by the city planner noting that all public facilities and services are nondeficient, unless the city planner determines the project is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan, and violates the standards of this article. The reasons for such finding must be set forth in detail, and the applicant shall have a right of appeal pursuant to [sub]section 401.08 hereof. For all nondeficient de minimus projects, the city planner shall administratively allocate or reserve capacity to affected public facilities and services pursuant to [sub]sections 401.05C. and D., and the finding of nondeficiency shall remain valid and in force for the time periods as provided in subsection 401.05A. It shall be presumed that the same rate of traffic generation for a de minimus project occurs on the project's directly accessed link(s) and surrounding local roads and intersections within the radius of development influence. However, the city planner may require a traffic impact study as set forth in [sub]section 402.02, if traffic assigned to the directly accessed link(s) and surrounding local roads and intersections is thought to warrant such a study to determine its impact within the radius of development influence. 
    401.08. Appeals. Appeals from the decision of the city planner shall betaken to the city manager as prescribed in subsection 301.05 of article III. The appeal shall be requested in writing within 20 calendar days of the applicant receiving the rendition letter containing the decision of the city planner. The written request shall state fully the reasons for the appeal. 
(Ord. No. 108-07, § 2, 5-13-2008; Ord. No. 35-11, § 4, 6-28-2011; Ord. No. 19-18, § 1, 3-13-2018) 
402.00. - Transportation concurrency. 
    402.01. Standard. 
A.  Generally. There is hereby established a transportation concurrency standard for all local roads and for all major roadways within the city as identified in the Comprehensive Plan. Except as specifically provided in this article, no development order shall be issued for a proposed project that would violate this standard. Establishment of concurrency shall be ascertained by this standard. Establishment of concurrency shall be ascertained by determining the amount of traffic a proposed project would generate together with existing, and background traffic, as set forth herein, and comparing it to the level-of-service established in the Comprehensive Plan. Level-of-service is computed by use of peak hour traffic or average daily traffic level-of-service maximum volumes for Florida's urban/urbanized areas in the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) "2002 Quality/Level of Service Handbook" on local roads and intersections within the radius of development influence and impacted major roadways and intersections as set forth herein. Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) shall be prepared, as set forth herein. 
B.  Project standard. 
1.  Segment standard. Except as specifically provided in this article, no development order shall be issued which would result in total trips generated during the buildout period of the project that would exceed the total trips allowed at the level-of-service (LOS) set forth in the Comprehensive Plan. Total trips shall be computed from DOT guidelines and based on peak hour or average daily traffic. This standard applies at any point on a roadway segment within the project's minimum radius of development influence and any point on an impacted major roadway segment, as set forth herein, where the total traffic on that segment results in a peak hour or average daily traffic volume that exceeds the level-of-service during the buildout period of the project. All intersections within the project's minimum radius of development influence and impacted major intersections, as set forth herein, operating below LOS "D" shall be upgraded to LOS "D" as a condition of issuing the development order pending the availability of these improvements. For purposes of this analysis, assured construction shall be considered. 
2.  The calculation of total traffic generated by a proposed nonresidential project will assume 100 percent buildout and occupancy of the project. 
3.  Current operating level-of-service shall be based upon the most recent traffic counts available plus projected traffic counts from previously committed developments. 
4.  Phasing. Phasing may be utilized by the applicant for projects with buildout dates more than five years in the future to establish compliance with the transportation level-of-service if the following conditions are met: 
a.  The proposed phasing results in all roadway segments within the project's minimum radius of development influence, all impacted major roadway segments, all intersections within the project's minimum radius of development influence, and all impacted major intersections of the proposed project complying with the standards set forth in [sub]section 402.01B during the buildout period of the project. 
b.  The proposed phasing is in five-year increments and agrees with the extent and timing of the assured construction. 
c.  The development services director confirms that construction is in fact assured construction. 
d.  Assured construction to be completed by the applicant shall be a condition of approval of the development order. A developer's agreement shall be executed with the city or sufficient performance surety shall be provided by the applicant and approved by the city attorney. 
C.  Proportionate fair-share. 
1.  A developer may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
a.  The proposed development is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and applicable Land Development Regulations; and 
b.  The five-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) includes a transportation capital improvement that, upon completion, will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development. 
2.  The city may choose to allow a developer to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fair-share contribution by contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development but is not contained in the five-year CIP, where one of the following conditions apply: 
a.  The city adds the improvement to the five-year CIP no later than the next regular capital improvements update of the Comprehensive Plan, provided that the improvement is financially feasible as defined by F.S. § 163.3180(16)(b)(1); or, 
b.  If the funds in the five-year CIP are insufficient to fully fund the construction of the improvement, the city may enter into a proportionate fair-share agreement with the developer authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is calculated if the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will, in the opinion of the city commission, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system, provided that improvement(s) is(are) adopted into the five-year CIP no later than the next regular capital improvements update of the Comprehensive Plan. 
3.  Any transportation capital improvement proposed to meet the developer's proportionate fair-share obligation must meet the design standards in the LDR for city-maintained roads and the design standards of the applicable governmental entity for all other roads. 
4.  A developer who shall commence any land development activity generating traffic, which results in a failure of a road segment to achieve transportation concurrency, may apply to the city for a proportionate fair-share agreement. 
a.  Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, a pre-application meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and other relevant issues. If the road segment that has failed to achieve transportation concurrency is on the Strategic Intermodal System, the Florida Department of Transportation shall be requested to participate in the pre-application meeting. 
b.  Procedures for review of application for proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(1)  The developer shall submit an application to the development services director that includes a non-refundable application fee of $5,000.00 and the following: 
(a)  Name, address and contact information of the developer; 
(b)  A drawing and legal description of the land; 
(c)  Phasing schedule; 
(d)  Description of the requested fair-share mitigation; 
(e)  If the requested fair-share mitigation involves a road segment on the Strategic Intermodal System (SIS), evidence of concurrence from the Florida Department of Transportation; 
(f)  Traffic study performed by a licensed traffic engineer demonstrating failure of road segment to achieve transportation concurrency. 
(2)  Within 20 days of receipt of the application, the development services director shall review the application to determine if the application is complete. If it is determined that the application is not complete, the development services director shall send a written statement to the developer delineating the deficiencies. If the developer does not remedy such deficiencies within 30 days of receipt of the written notification, then the application shall be deemed abandoned. The development services director, in his sole discretion, may grant an extension to cure such deficiencies, provided the developer has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure. 
(3)  Once the development services director determines that the application is complete, written notification shall be sent to the developer. The development services director shall also forward the developer's application to the city attorney who shall, within 30 days, draft a proportionate fair-share agreement for consideration by the city commission at a meeting no later than 60 days from the date the developer received the notification that the application was complete. 
(4)  No proportionate fair-share agreement shall be effective until approved by the city commission. 
5.  Proportionate fair-share mitigation includes, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and contribution of transportation facilities. 
a.  The methodology used to calculate a developer's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(12), and as represented by the following formula: 
Proportionate Share = ([Development Trips] / [SV Increase]) × Cost 
Where: 
Development Trips = Those trips from the development that are assigned to roadway segment; 
SV Increase = Service volume increase provided by the improvement to the roadway segment; 
Cost = Adjusted cost of the improvement. 
b.  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, improvement costs shall be based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the CIP, the Volusia MPO Transportation Improvement Program, or the Florida Department of Transportation Work Program. Where such information is not available, the improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods: 
(1)  An analysis by the department of development services of costs, adjusted by the Florida Department of Transportation Price Trends Index from the previous year, by cross section type that incorporates data from recent projects; or 
(2)  The most recent issue of Florida Department of Transportation "Transportation Costs," as adjusted based upon the type of cross section (urban or rural); locally available data from recent projects on acquisition, drainage, and utility costs; and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. 
c.  If the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the developer, then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section. 
d.  If the city accepts any right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value of the land, upon which the right-of-way is or will be located, by the Volusia County Property Appraiser or, at the mutual agreement of the city and the developer, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city. The developer shall supply a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the developer is less than the city estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the developer must also pay the difference. 
e.  Proportionate fair-share mitigation shall be applied as a credit against impact fees. Credits will be given for that portion of the impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements on which the proportionate fair-share contribution is calculated. Additionally, if the proportionate fair-share contribution is based on only a portion of the development's traffic, the credit will be limited to that portion of the impact fees on which the proportionate fair-share contribution is based. 
f.  At the time the proportionate fair-share obligation is being determined, the city will also compute the transportation facilities impact fee obligation for the proposed development. If the developer's proportionate fair-share obligation is less than the development's anticipated total transportation facilities impact fee, then the developer must pay the difference to the city. 
6.  Should the developer fail to apply for a building permit within two years of the date of execution of the proportionate fair-share agreement, then the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the developer shall be required to reapply in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter. 
7.  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be non-refundable. If the payment is submitted more than one year from the date of execution of the agreement, then the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment, pursuant to section 402.01(C)(5)(a) and adjusted accordingly. 
8.  Developer improvements authorized under this subchapter involving dedications to the city must be completed upon final acceptance of the improvements and receipt of a warranty bond. The city attorney shall approve the form of the warranty bond. 
9.  Developer improvements authorized under this subchapter not involving dedications to the city must be completed upon recording of a final plat or upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, whichever event first occurs. 
10.  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order will be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic. 
11.  A developer may submit a letter to withdraw the proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee to the city will be non-refundable. 
12.  All proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the CIP, or for use as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
13.  In the event a scheduled transportation facility improvement is removed from the CIP, then the revenues collected for its construction shall be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of section 402.01(C)(2)(b), as determined by the city commission. 
    402.02 Transportation Impact Analysis. The City of New Smyrna Beach has adopted the following Transportation Impact Analysis: 
TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS, (TIA) Guidelines Methodology For Development Applications Requiring a TIA Within the River to Sea TPO Metropolitan Planning Area, TIA Guidelines dated June 2016. 
(Ord. No. 125-06, § 1, 11-28-2006; Ord. No. 21-09, § 1, 4-14-2009; Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-8-2011; Ord. No. 76-16, § 1, 12-13-2016) 
403.00. - Sanitary sewer concurrency. 
    403.01. Standard. 
A.  Generally. All wastewater treatment facilities serving development projects within the city shall comply with the sanitary sewer concurrency standard presented in the comprehensive plan and in this section. Except as specifically provided in this article, no development order shall be issued for a proposed project which would violate this standard. Establishment of concurrency shall be ascertained by determining the capacity of the wastewater treatment facilities which shall be determined by utilizing the existing capacity available to serve proposed projects. The existing capacity shall be determined by computing the total of the committed flow to other proposed projects plus present average daily flow of the wastewater treatment facility to be impacted by a proposed project, as reasonably determined by the utilities commission using accepted engineering principles. This gallonage figure shall be subtracted from the design capacity of the wastewater treatment facilities, thereby yielding the wastewater treatment facility capacity that can be supplied to the proposed project. The capacity needed by the proposed project shall be determined by utilizing the level of service standard of 207 gallons per day per equivalent residential unit calculated by use of the formula set forth in Table 3 below. 
TABLE 3 
LEVEL OF SERVICE 
ERU CAPACITY DEMAND SCHEDULE 
Category I. 
    Dwelling units. Structures which are intended to be used for living accommodations, including ancillary facilities specifically designated for residents of the dwelling units. One unit is equivalent to one ERU, with a minimum requirement of one ERU per unit. When dealing with hotels, motels and timeshares, the term unit refers to a rental unit. Ancillary facilities do not include food service facilities. Examples of such are: 
1.  Single and multifamily structures 
2.  Hotels and motels 
3.  Trailer parks 
4.  Condominiums 
5.  Time shares 
Category II. 
    Retail and churches.

9.  Movie theaters 
10.  Health and fitness centers 
11.  Meeting and/or banquet rooms 
12.  Bowling alley (lanes area not included in floor space calculations) 
13.  Parks (building floor space is for restroom facilities) 
Category V. 
    Manufacturing and storage. Factory and warehouse structures where sanitary facilities are used primarily by employees. One ERU is applicable for the first 2,000 square feet of building floor space. For area in addition to the initial 2,000 square feet, a rate of one ERU per 4,000 square feet is applicable. A minimum of one ERU per structure is required. This category calculation applies only to sanitary facilities required for domestic use and does not include process related water and/or wastewater flows. Examples of such are: 
1.  Manufacturing 
2.  Warehousing 
Category VI. 
    Food service. All establishments involved mainly in the preparation and serving of food and/or beverage on-site for public consumption. A value of 2.5 ERU per 1,000 square feet of building floor space is applicable, with a minimum requirement of 2.5 ERUs per establishment. This category calculation accommodates both sanitary facilities for public use (i.e. restrooms) and water and wastewater capacity requirements for food/beverage preparation and cleanup. Examples of such are: 
1.  Restaurant/cafeteria 
2.  Carryout restaurant 
3.  Fast food restaurant 
4.  Bars and lounges 
Category VII. 
    Special uses. Those establishments with an expected high water usage and/or wastewater generation. One ERU should be added to the total facility use calculations for sanitary facilities (i.e. restrooms) for employee and customer use. Examples of such are: 
1.  Commercial laundry: 19 ERU/1,000 square feet 
2.  Launderette-Self service: 1.33 ERU/washing machine

Category VIII. 
    Individual cases. Facilities whose water and wastewater flow vary significantly based on the specific use of the facility. These facilities must be considered on an individual, case by case, basis. water usage and wastewater generation will be determined based on anticipated capacity needs supplied by the applicant. Examples of such are: 
1.  Processing Plants-Industrial Processes 
Notes: 
1.  Any use not specifically defined in categories I-VIII will be assigned one of the above listed categories, which in the opinion of the utilities commission, best approximates proposed facility use. 
2.  If a building or plumbing permit is issued for an existing connection which will increase water and/or waste water demand, or if a building changes from residential to nonresidential occupancy, the total number of ERUs for the old and new parts of the facility shall be computed and the number of additional ERUs determined by subtracting the old ERUs from the new total number of ERUs for the facility. 
3.  In order to differentiate between grocery and convenience stores, and for the purposes of this resolution, convenience stores are defined as mercantile establishments which offer food and other products similar to those offered by grocery stores but with a more restricted selection. Convenience stores are therefore defined as establishments which have a gross square footage not exceeding 3,000 square feet. 
    An equivalent residential unit (ERU) represents a nominal production of 250 gallons of wastewater per day, or 0.833 times the nominal water usage per ERU. The relationship between water and wastewater flow has been determined by utilizing historical customer account records for water sales, and pollution control treatment flows, for the utilities commission's system. 
    Unless a development order is issued pursuant to subsection 401.06E., hereof, no development order shall be granted, unless conditioned upon the availability to the proposed project of a sufficient capacity in wastewater treatment facilities to provide service to the project. Using the standards set forth herein, wastewater treatment facilities capacity must be supplied to serve the proposed project concurrent with the impacts of the project. 
B.  On-site sewage disposal system. The New Smyrna Beach utilities commission, must first determine if sanitary sewer is available and advise the environmental office of the Volusia County health department accordingly. Septic tanks may be used as permitted by the Volusia County health department in compliance with Florida Administrative LDR, ch. 10D-6. No development order shall be granted until the applicant submits a septic tank permit obtained from the Volusia County health department to the city planner and it has been determined that all requirements have been complied with in subsection [403.01.A.] hereof. 
C.  Determination of capacity. In order to demonstrate that an application for a development order complies with this article, the city shall compute the capacity available to serve a particular proposed project. The applicant may submit additional data or information pursuant to [sub]section 401.06B. Any additional information shall be based on accepted engineering principles as determined by the utilities commission. If the capacity availability being analyzed is from a wastewater treatment facility operated by a person other than the utilities commission, including but not limited to Volusia County, prior to the issuance of a development order, a certificate from said person operating the wastewater treatment facility must be submitted to the city planner. The certificate must affirm the existence of sufficient wastewater treatment facility capacity based on facility design flow, present average daily flow, committed flow, and Table 3 level of service standards in this article. Further, the certificate must affirmatively indicate that said capacity has been reserved for the proposed project and the duration of the reservation. Upon expiration of said reservation, the applicant will be required to undergo a new concurrency evaluation. 
(1)  Projected buildout period. The evaluation shall consider reserved capacity or any capacity to which another proposed project shall have a prior and superior claim during the proposed project's projected buildout period. The projected buildout period of the proposed project shall be set forth in the evaluation and shall be determined by the city planner based on the following criteria: 
a.  The size, type and location of the proposed project; 
b.  Customary buildout periods for projects of similar size, type, and location; and 
c.  Any other factors or conditions relevant to the specific project, including special market conditions and schedules of assured construction. 
Existing available capacity will likely increase or decrease during the buildout period of the proposed project. The study must account for this increase or decrease in available treatment capacity based on conditions during the buildout period of the proposed project. The projection of available treatment capacity shall be based upon the difference between the permitted design capacity of the wastewater treatment facilities, less the cumulative sum of average daily flow and committed flow at the time of submission, and shall be established in accordance with the requirements set forth in this article and accepted engineering principles as determined by the utilities commission. This change in treatment capacity shall be shown as it relates to any proposed phasing. 
(2)  Assured construction. Assured construction shall be considered completed as scheduled for the purpose of preparation of the evaluation. Whether it is in fact assured construction and the timing of the assured construction shall be subject to the confirmation of the city planner. 
(3)  Project phasing. The study may reflect a proposed phasing schedule for the development of the proposed project. This schedule shall address the time at which each phase will place impacts on the wastewater treatment facility to be impacted at the time of submission of each phase. Wastewater treatment capacity will not be taken into consideration unless the project is permitted by the State of Florida, Department of Environmental Protection during initial application.

404.00. - Potable water facility concurrency. 
    404.01. Standard. 
A.  Generally. All potable water supply facilities serving development projects within the city shall comply with the potable water concurrency standard presented in the comprehensive plan and in this section. Except as specifically provided in this article, no development order shall be issued for a proposed project which would violate this standard. Establishment of concurrency shall be ascertained by determining the capacity for potable water supply facilities which shall be determined by utilizing the existing capacity. The existing capacity shall be determined by computing the total of the committed flow to other proposed projects plus present average daily flow of the potable water supply facility to be impacted by a proposed project, as reasonably determined by the utilities commission using accepted engineering principles. This gallonage figure shall be subtracted from the design capacity of the potable water supply facilities, thereby yielding the available potable water supply facilities capacity that can be supplied to the proposed project. The capacity needed by the proposed project shall be determined utilizing the potable water level of service standard of 240 gallons per day per equivalent residential unit calculated by use of the formula set forth in Table 4 below.

Notes: 
1.  Any use not specifically defined in categories I-VIII will be assigned one of the above listed categories, which in the opinion of the utilities commission, best approximates proposed facility use. 
2.  If a building or plumbing permit is issued for an existing connection which will increase water and/or wastewater demand, or if a building changes from residential to nonresidential occupancy, the total number of ERUs for the old and new parts of the facility shall be computed and the number of additional ERUs determined by subtracting the old ERUs from the new total number of ERUs for the facility. 
3.  In order to differentiate between grocery and convenience stores, and for the purposes of this resolution, convenience stores are defined as mercantile establishments which offer food and other products similar to those offered by grocery stores but with a more restricted selection. Convenience stores are therefore defined as establishments which have a gross square footage not exceeding 3,000 square feet. 
4.  An equivalent residential unit (ERU) represents a nominal usage of 300 gallons of water per day as determined by using historical customer account records and water sales for the utilities commission's system. 
Unless a development order is issued pursuant to subsection 401.06E. hereof, no development order shall be granted, unless conditioned upon the availability to the proposed project of a sufficient capacity in potable water treatment facilities to provide service to the project. Using the standards set forth herein, potable water treatment facilities capacity must be supplied to serve the proposed project concurrent with the impacts of the project. 
B.  Private wells. Where private wells are to be utilized, the standards of the St. John's River Water Management District and other applicable state regulations shall be utilized. 
C.  Determination of capacity. In order to demonstrate that an application for a development order complies with this article, the city shall compute the capacity available to serve a particular proposed project. The applicant may submit additional data or information pursuant to [sub]section 401.06B. Any additional information shall be based on accepted engineering principles as determined by the utilities commission. 
(1)  Projected buildout period. The evaluation shall consider reserved capacity or any capacity to which another proposed project shall have a prior and superior claim during the proposed project's projected buildout period. The projected buildout period of the proposed project shall be set forth in the evaluation and shall be determined by the city planner based on the following criteria: 
a.  The size, type, and location of the proposed project; 
b.  Customary buildout periods for projects of similar size, type, and location; and 
c.  Any other factors or conditions relevant to the specific project, including special market conditions and schedules of assured construction. 
Existing available capacity will likely increase or decrease during the buildout period of the proposed project. The evaluation should account for this increase or decrease in available treatment capacity based on conditions during the buildout period of the proposed project. The projection of available treatment capacity shall be based upon the difference between the permitted design capacity of the potable water supply facilities, less the cumulative sum of average daily flow and committed flow at the time of submission, and shall be established in accordance with the requirements set forth in this article and accepted engineering principles as determined by the utilities commission. This change in treatment capacity shall be shown as it relates to any proposed phasing. 
(2)  Assured construction. Assured construction shall be considered completed as scheduled for the purpose of preparation of the evaluation. Whether it is in fact assured construction and the timing of the assured construction shall be subject to the confirmation of the city planner. 
(3)  Project phasing. The study may reflect a proposed phasing schedule for the development of the proposed project. This schedule shall address the time at which each phase will place impacts on the potable water supply facility to be impacted at the time of submission of each phase.

405.00. - Solid waste disposal concurrency. 
    405.01. Standard. 
A.  [ Compliance. ] All solid waste disposal facilities serving development projects within the city shall comply with the solid waste disposal concurrency standard presented in the comprehensive plan and in this section. Except as specifically provided in this article, no development order shall be issued for a proposed project which would violate this standard. Establishment of concurrency shall be ascertained by determining the capacity for solid waste disposal facilities which shall be determined by utilizing the existing capacity. The existing capacity shall be determined by computing the total of the committed capacity to other proposed projects plus the existing amount of solid waste generated. This figure shall be subtracted from the design capacity of the solid waste disposal facility (city's transfer station) impacted, thereby yielding the solid waste impacted disposal facility capacity that can be used by a proposed project. The present design capacity of the transfer station is 100 tons per day and the station is operating at 80 percent capacity. By 1996, the city proposes to upgrade the transfer station to a 200-ton-per-day capacity to meet future needs in compliance with the future land use plan contained in the comprehensive plan. The amount of solid waste generated by the proposed project, and impacting a solid waste disposal facility, shall be determined by utilizing the existing applicable solid waste disposal facility level of service of 7.3 pounds of solid waste per capita per day. Nonresidential solid waste is provided for in the 7.3 pounds per capita figure, since it was obtained by dividing total daily tonnage by city population. No development order shall be granted unless conditioned upon the availability to the project of a sufficient capacity of solid waste disposal facilities to provide service to the project. No final development order shall be granted unless, using the standards set forth herein, solid waste disposal facility capacity can be supplied to serve the proposed project concurrent with the impacts of the project. 
B.  Determination of capacity. In order to demonstrate that an application for a development order complies with this article, the city shall compute the capacity available to serve a particular proposed project. The applicant may submit additional data or information pursuant to [sub]section 401.06B. Any additional information shall be based on accepted engineering principles. 
(1)  Projected buildout period. The concurrency evaluation shall consider reserved capacity or any capacity to which another proposed project shall have a prior and superior claim during the proposed project's projected buildout period. The projected buildout period of the proposed project shall be set forth in the evaluation and shall be determined by the city planner based on the following criteria: 
a.  The size, type, and location of the proposed project; 
b.  Customary buildout periods for projects of similar size, type, and location; and 
c.  Any other factors or conditions relevant to the specific project, including special market conditions and schedules of assured construction. 
(2)  Assured construction. Assured construction shall be considered completed as scheduled for the purpose of preparation of the evaluation. Whether it is in fact assured construction and the timing of the assured construction shall be subject to the confirmation of the city planner. 
(3)  Project phasing. The study may reflect a proposed phasing schedule for the development of the proposed project. 
(4)  Issuance of development order. Concurrency for solid waste disposal facilities for each project shall be documented by letter from the public works superintendent simultaneously with the issuance of a development order. 
406.00. - Parks/recreation concurrency. 
    406.01. Standard. 
A.  Generally. All residential projects proposed within the city shall comply with the recreation and open space concurrency standard presented in the comprehensive plan and in this section. Except as specifically provided in this article, no development order shall be issued for a residential proposed project which would violate this standard. Establishment of concurrency shall be ascertained by determining the need expressed in acreage, rounded downward to the nearest one-tenth acre, for neighborhood, community, and regional parks that a proposed project will generate, as set forth herein. The need generated by a proposed project, expressed in fractional acreage, shall be added to the existing demand also expressed in fractional acreage, rounded to the nearest one-tenth acre, for each neighborhood, community, and regional parks. For the purposes of this article, each residential unit or single-family dwelling shall be considered to have a population of 2.4 persons. Existing demand, as that term is used in this article IV, shall include demand created by constructed residential projects and proposed projects permitted but unbuilt which have been allocated or reserved capacity as set forth in this LDR within the radius of development influence (as set forth in Table 6 hereof) for a particular type of park. Existing demand plus demand or need generated by the proposed project shall represent total demand. Existing design capacity for each neighborhood, community, and regional parks, shall be computed and total demand within the applicable park's radius of development influence shall be subtracted therefrom to yield the existing capacity of each park type available to serve a proposed project. This figure shall be compared to the demand or need generated by a proposed project to ascertain whether there is a deficiency in the level of service for each neighborhood, community or regional parks. With regard to a neighborhood park, concurrency may be satisfied by meeting the concurrency standard as set forth above, or alternatively, by establishing a suitable neighborhood park within a proposed residential subdivision within the radius of development influence.

B.  Determination of capacity. In order to demonstrate that an application for a development order complies with this article, the city shall compute the capacity available to serve a particular proposed project. The applicant may submit additional data or information pursuant to [sub]section 401.06B. Any additional information shall be based on accepted engineering principles. 
(1)  Projected buildout period. The projected buildout period of the proposed project shall be set forth in the evaluation and shall be determined by the city planner based on the following criteria: 
a.  The size, type, and location of the proposed project; 
b.  Customary buildout periods for projects of similar size, type, and location; and 
c.  Any other factors or conditions relevant to the specific project, including special market conditions and schedules of assured construction. 
Existing available capacity will likely increase or decrease during the buildout period of the proposed project. The evaluation should account for this increase or decrease in available treatment capacity based on conditions during the buildout period of the proposed project. The projection of available neighborhood, community, and regional park facilities, shall be based upon the difference for each type of park facility within the radius of development influence between the design capacity of the park facility less the sum of the cumulative existing usage and park size plus the committed usage at the time of submission as a result of other proposed projects. This change in capacity shall be shown as it relates to any proposed phasing. 
(2)  Assured construction. Assured construction shall be considered completed as scheduled for the purpose of preparation of the evaluation, whether it is in fact assured construction and the timing of the assured construction shall be subject to the confirmation of the city planner. 
(3)  Project phasing. The study may reflect a proposed phasing schedule for the development of the proposed project. This schedule shall address the time at which each phase will place impacts on neighborhood, community, and regional park facilities to be impacted at the time of submission of each phase. 
407.00. - Drainage concurrency. 
    407.01. Standard. 
A.  Generally. All parcels of land within the city shall comply with the drainage retention and stormwater management system concurrency standard presented in the comprehensive plan and in this section. Except as specifically provided in this article, no development order shall be issued for a proposed project which would violate this standard. All development orders shall be conditioned upon satisfaction of the level of service standards in this Section. Establishment of satisfaction of the concurrency standard herein shall be ascertained through submission of a stormwater management plan as provided in this LDR. The level of service standard for concurrency evaluation herein shall require on-site retention of the first inch of runoff. Post-development discharge for the 25-year 24-hour storm event shall not exceed 110 percent of predevelopment discharge. Frequently occurring two-, five- and ten-year storm events and seldom occurring 25- and 50- year storm events will be accommodated by maintaining existing drainage systems and constructing new drainage systems. 
    407.02. Stormwater management plan. 
A.  Generally. In order to demonstrate that an application for a development order complies with this article, the applicant shall be required by the city to submit a stormwater management plan simultaneously with the issuance of a development order. The stormwater management plan shall address the requirements and standards of this article, [sub]section 604.02 of this LDR, and Code of Ordinances, [1975] chapter 27, Stormwater Management and Conservation ordinance. Said plan shall ensure the proposed project will have drainage retention capacity and that stormwater management system capacity is sufficient to meet or exceed the level of service set forth herein. The form and level of detail required in the stormwater management plan shall be established by the city engineer in accordance with accepted engineering principles. 
B.  Professional services. The stormwater management plan shall be prepared, sealed, and signed, by a qualified professional engineer, licensed to practice in the State of Florida. 
Editor's note- Stormwater utility provisions are found in Chapter 82, Article VI of this code. 
408.00 - Public school facilities concurrency. 
    408.01. Standard. 
A.  Generally. All comprehensive plan amendments and rezonings which would increase density, and all subdivision plats and site plans associated with residential projects proposed within the city shall comply with the public school facilities concurrency standard presented in the comprehensive plan and in this section. Except as specifically provided in this article, no development order shall be issued for a residential proposed project that would violate this standard. In considering whether to adopt any comprehensive plan amendment or rezonings that would increase allowable residential densities, or residential subdivision plats or site plans, the city shall consider the factors set forth in the written report of the school district. No comprehensive plan amendment or rezoning that increases residential density shall be adopted, nor shall any residential subdivision plat or site plan be approved if adequate public schools cannot be timely planned and constructed to serve the projected increase in the student population.

502.00. - Official zoning map. 
    502.01. Identification of official map. The official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor, attested by the city clerk, and bearing the seal of the city under the following words: "This is to certify that this is the official zoning map referred to in article V of the land development regulations of the City of New Smyrna Beach, Florida adopted January 22, 1991." 
    502.02. Map changes. Where changes are made in district boundaries or other matters portrayed by the official zoning map, the city planner shall enter those changes on the official zoning map promptly after the change has been approved by the city commission and becomes effective. All changes made to the official zoning map shall conform to the requirements and procedures of this LDR. The city planner shall keep a log of all changes made to the official zoning map, beginning with the date of adoption of the map, which includes a copy of each ordinance requiring a change to the map. 
    502.03. Official map, final authority. Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zoning map which may, from time to time, be made or published, the official zoning map, which shall be located in the office of the planning and zoning department, shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings, and other structures in the city. 
    502.04. Replacement of official zoning map. In the event the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the city commission may adopt a new official zoning map, which shall supersede the prior official zoning map. The new official zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official zoning map, but no such corrections shall have the effect of amending the original official zoning map or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor, attested by the city clerk, and bearing the seal of the city under the following words: "This is to certify that this official zoning map supersedes and replaces the official zoning map adopted (date of adoption of map being replaced) as part of the land development regulations of the City of New Smyrna Beach, Florida." Unless the prior official zoning map has been lost, or has been totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment. 
503.00. - Interpretation of district boundaries. 
    Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
    503.01. Boundaries approximately following streets, highways, or alleys. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, or alleys, shall be construed to follow such centerlines. Streets, highways, or alleys, which serve as dividing lines between zoning districts, vacated by ordinance of the city commission shall be assigned a zoning district classification(s), at the time of vacation by the city commission. The city commission, in assigning said classification(s), shall assign to the vacated street, highway or alley, the same zoning district classification(s) of at least one adjacent property. 
    503.02. Boundaries approximately following platted lot lines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines. 
    503.03. Boundaries approximately following city limits. Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be construed as following such city limits. 
    503.04. Boundaries approximately following railroad lines. Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway between the railroad right-of-way. 
    503.05. Boundaries approximately following shorelines, stream beds, or other water bodies. Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to follow such shorelines, except where bulkhead lines have been established, the boundary lines shall follow the bulkhead lines. In the event of change in the shoreline, the boundary shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes or other bodies of water, shall be construed to follow such centerlines. Any change in the shoreline must be the result of natural erosion and/or accretion of the land thereby causing the shoreline to be located in a different site than shown on the official zoning map. The movement of the shoreline must not be the result of unnatural means, such as filling, excavation, or alteration of the grade of the land. 
    503.06. Conflicts between platted lot line and shoreline of a water body. In the event that a zoning district boundary line follows both the platted lot line as provided for in [sub]section 503.02, and the shoreline of a water body as provided for in [sub]section 503.05, the zoning district boundary line shall be interpreted to follow the shoreline of a water body as set forth in [sub]section 503.05. 
    503.07. Annexation or removal of territory from city. Areas annexed into the city shall be assigned a zoning classification as approved by the city commission, and such classification may be established prior to, but made subject to, successful annexation of the area. In the event of changes in the city limits removing territory from the city, district boundaries shall be construed as moving with the city limits. 
    503.08. Boundaries approximately parallel of extension of above features. Boundaries indicated as parallel to, or extensions of features indicated in subsections 503.01 through 503.05 above, shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map using the center of the line drawn on the official zoning map. 
504.00. - District regulations and requirements. 
    504.01. General regulations. 
A.  No building, structure, or land, shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in conformity with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located. 
B.  Uses not designated as permitted by right or subject to additional conditions in a district shall be prohibited from that district. Special exceptions are permitted subject to additional regulations imposed. The special exceptions may be approved only by the city commission following proper application as described within this LDR. Additional uses may be added to this LDR by amendment. 
C.  In any business district, more than one structure housing a permitted principal use may be erected on a single commercial lot, provided that yard and other requirements of this LDR shall be met for each structure and the total lot. 
D.  Density under this LDR shall be computed by multiplying the acreage by the number of allowable units. The property owners shall be allowed to build one additional unit in cases where utilizing the above formula (acreage times allowable units) produces a fractional unit one-half or greater. (For example: The property owner owns 1.05 acres. The LDR allows 12 units per acre. Utilizing this formula, this would compute to 12.6 allowable units on the site. The number of allowable units on this site would therefore be 13. Second example: The property owner owns 1.04 acres. The LDR allows 12 units per acre. Utilizing the formula, this would compute to 12.48 buildable units. The total number of units allowable on this site would therefore be 12. 
E.  No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this LDR shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of this LDR shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this LDR.

I.  Lots platted or created prior to the effective date of this LDR having less width, depth and area than required in their zoning district but having no less than 90 percent of the width, depth and area shall be considered conforming with the requirements of this LDR. 
J.  Any lot platted or created prior to the effective date of this LDR which meets two of the three size requirements of width, depth and area and which meet no less than 85 percent of the third requirement shall be considered a nonconforming lot but shall be considered buildable. 
K.  The number of residential and hotel/motel units and the percentage of building coverage and impervious lot coverage allowed on oceanfront property shall be calculated by using only the land zoned for residential or hotel/motel use. The applicant must demonstrate, by evidence of clear title, that the upland property is under its control and has not been dedicated or reserved for a public use including, but not limited to, recreational, right-of-way or park use; is not submerged by ocean, natural lake, natural pond or other natural waters, and is not subject to a deed restriction.

Land that has been dedicated or reserved for any public use, including but not limited to, recreational or park use; land that is within the beach/dune system; land that is underneath a public right-of-way; land that is submerged by ocean, natural lake, natural pond or other natural waters, or land that is under water from the mean high water line waterward, shall not be used for calculation of density or lot area. 
M.  Land that has been conveyed to or acquired by a governmental entity for right-of-way purposes or other public purposes, may be used in calculation of allowable density for the development of the remaining portion of the lot or parcel after the conveyance to the governmental unit, provided that the portion conveyed does not exceed 20 percent of the area of such lot or parcel prior to conveyance.

O.  Front yard setbacks shall be calculated from the future right-of-way line as indicated in the Traffic Circulation Element, Table III-2, for property located along the rights-of-way listed in Table III-2 of the comprehensive plan or the setback required in the respective district, whichever is greater. 
P.  No single-family residential lot may contain more than one principal structure and no residential lot may contain more than one principal use. 
Q.  Walkways on private property that are five feet in width or less may be located as close as one foot from side and rear property lines, such that there is no dedicated drainage easement present or negative impacts to drainage.

3.  Air pollution. 
a.  Visible emissions. There shall not be discharged into the atmosphere, from any source, any air pollution in excess of the darkness limitations listed below. This shall include emissions of air pollutant of such opacity as to obscure an observer's view to a degree equal to, or greater than, do the visible emissions described below. In addition to the foregoing, visible emissions of any kind at ground level past the lot line of the property on which the source of the emissions is located are prohibited. The darkness and/or opacity limitations are as follows. No. 1 on the Ringelmann chart at all times, except upon determination that the emission contains less than one-tenth pound of dry gases, adjusted to 12 percent carbon dioxide or 50 percent excess air. 
b.  Materials handling. No person shall cause or permit any material to be handled, transported, or stored in a manner which allows or may allow particulate matter to become airborne. 
c.  Particulate matter. There shall not be discharged into the atmosphere any particulate matter in excess of the quantities shown below: 
(1)  From refuse-burning equipment, per 1,000 pounds of dry gases, adjusted to 12 percent CO 2 or 50 percent excess air, 65/100 pound for capacities over 200 pounds per hours. In any one-hour period this shall not exceed 250 pounds. Refuse shall not be burned in fuel-burning equipment. 
(2)  From fuel-burning equipment, six-tenths pound per million BTU input for installation using less than ten million BTU per hour total input. For installations using more than ten million BTU per hour total input, the allowable particulate emission, in pounds per million BTU is determined by multiplying 8.58 times the input, in BTU per hour, raised to the minus 0.165 power (E=8.58 I -0.165 ). 
d.  Threshold values. There shall not be discharged into the atmosphere any contaminant for which threshold limit values are listed for working atmosphere by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists in such quantity that the concentration of the contaminant at ground level at any point beyond the boundary of the property shall, at any time, exceed the threshold limit. 
4.  Odors. Any condition of operation which results in the creation of odors of such intensity and character as to be detrimental to the health and welfare of the public or which interferes unreasonably with the comfort of the public shall be removed, stopped or so modified as to remove the odor. 
5.  Electromagnetic radiation. The following standard shall apply: 
a.  General. It shall be unlawful to operate or cause to be operated, any planned or intentional source of electromagnetic radiation for such purposes as communication, experimentation, entertainment, broadcasting, heating, navigation, therapy, vehicle velocity measurement, weather survey, aircraft detection, topographical survey, personal pleasure, or any other use directly or indirectly associated with these present purposes which does not comply with the then current regulations of the federal Communications commission regarding such sources of electromagnetic radiation except that for all governmental agencies and government owned plants; the regulations of the Interdepartment Radio Advisory committee shall take precedence over the regulations of the federal Communications commission regarding such sources of electromagnetic radiation. Further, said operation in compliance with the federal Communications commission or the interdepartmental Radio Advisory committee regulations shall be unlawful if such radiation causes an abnormal degradation in performance of other electromagnetic radiators or electromagnetic receptors of quality and proper design because of proximity, primary field, blanketing, spurious reradiation, harmonic content, modulation or energy conducted by power or telephone lines. The determination of "abnormal degradation in performance" and "of quality and property design" shall be made in accordance with good engineering practices as defined in the latest principles and standards of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the Institute of Radio Engineers, and the Electronic Industries Association. 
b.  Electromagnetic interference. For the purpose of these regulations, electromagnetic interference shall be defined as electromagnetic disturbances which are generated by the use of electrical equipment other than planned and intentional sources of electromagnetic receptors of quality and proper design. It shall be unlawful to operate, or to cause to be operated, any source of electromagnetic interference where the radiation or transmission from same violates the provisions section 22-8(a), part II, Code of Ordinances. 
6.  Fire and explosion. All activities and storage of flammable and explosive [materials] at any location shall be provided with adequate safety and firefighting devices in accordance with the Fire Prevention Code and other technical codes adopted by the City of New Smyrna Beach, State of Florida, and other appropriate governmental agencies.

New Smyrna Map 
COZ, CORRIDOR OVERLAY ZONE 
1.  Arterial Corridor Overlay Zone (COZ) established. An Arterial Corridor Overlay Zone (COZ) is hereby established and the regulations of this section shall apply in said zone. Said zone shall apply to all zoning classifications established in article VI of this LDR and the Official Zoning Map shall identify said overlay zone by adding the letter "C" as a suffix to the existing zoning classification that currently exists on said map. These arterial corridor regulations apply to properties along the following roadways: 
- SR 44 from Myrtle Avenue west to the New Smyrna Beach corporate boundary, excluding properties in the Activity Center, as shown on the City's comprehensive plan future land use map, and 
- US-1 from Art Center Avenue to the northern city boundary line. 
2.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish regulations to ensure safe ingress to and egress from proposed development along arterial transportation corridors by: 
a.  Reducing the number of indiscriminate driveways; 
b.  Maintaining the integrity of the corridor by assuring that traffic generation is consistent with the corridor's designed capacity; 
c.  Lessening the possibility of hazardous traffic conditions and traffic congestion; and 
d.  Establishing development standards, including additional buffer and landscaping regulations that will preserve and enhance the natural character of the corridor, which serves as a gateway into the city. 
e.  Screen parked vehicles from view of the traveling public. 
As commercial development expands along arterial transportation corridors, conflicts result between the corridor's function and its ability to move high volumes of traffic through an area. This congestion is intensified where commercial growth is permitted adjacent to the corridor disproportionate to the corridor's designed limitations. 
3.  Applicability. The increased commercial growth that has occurred along these gateway corridors in recent years has started changing the character of the corridors. What were once tree-lined corridors have gradually and often rapidly begun to exhibit characteristics of uncontrolled strip commercial development. Once this pattern is established it is difficult to encourage alternative types of development (e.g. residential) along these corridors. Therefore, these regulations apply to the arterial corridors listed above, which: 
a.  Move large volumes of through traffic in addition to significant volumes of everyday local traffic, and 
b.  Do not contain significant amounts of strip commercial development. 
These arterial corridor regulations are intended to supplement the applicable regulations of the underlying zoning classifications present within the COZ. The underlying zoning district shall determine the permitted and special exception uses allowed but the site design, signage, building location, and the dimensional requirements contained in this section shall supersede the standards of the zoning district. 
4.  Dimensional requirements. 
a.  Lot width: No premise shall be divided for the purpose of development or sale such that the width of each, or any premise, is less than 300 feet measured along the right-of-way line, except that if vehicle access is provided by means other than directly onto an arterial, then the minimum lot width requirement may be reduced to 150 feet, and direct vehicle access to a major arterial shall be prohibited. 
b.  Building setbacks within the COZ: 
i.  Front yard setback (inclusive of landscape buffer and utility commission easement): 
US-1: 45 feet minimum; 65 feet maximum. 
SR 44: 70-075 feet minimum from the west city limits to Eddie Road; 50-55 feet minimum from Eddie Road to Myrtle Avenue. 
ii.  Rear yard setback: 25 feet minimum. 
iii.  Side yard setback: 25 feet minimum. 
iv.  Lots with multiple frontages: 
(a)  Parcels which front on two streets shall meet the above building setbacks for the corridor frontage and a 25-foot setback on the other street or as required per section 504.01(0) of this LDR. 
(b)  Parcels fronting on three streets shall provide the above building setback for the corridor frontage and a 25-foot setback on the remaining streets or as required per section 504.01(0) of this LDR. 
c.  Principal building height: Three stories maximum, not to exceed 35 feet. 
d.  Building coverage: The total area covered with buildings on any lot shall not exceed 35 percent of the total lot area. This calculation does not include any other paved areas. 
5.  Minimum buffer depth and landscaping. The required landscaping within the corridor buffer along SR 44 within the COZ boundaries shall be as follows. No additional buffering is required along the US-1 corridor within the COZ. 
a.  Landscape buffer depth and tree requirement: 
West City Limits to Eddie Rd. Eddie Rd.to Myrtle Ave Buffer Depth (excludes utility easements) 50 ft. 35 ft. Canopy Trees (number of trees per 100 ft. of lot frontage) 5 4 Understory Trees (number of trees per 100 ft. of lot frontage) 7 5 Shrubs (number of shrubs per 100 ft. of frontage) 20 3 ft. high continuous hedge farthest from the road

a.  Existing trees with a minimum height of nine feet and a minimum diameter of two inches, when measured four and one-half feet above ground level, shall be retained within the landscaped buffer. Existing shrubs with a minimum height of two feet shall be retained within the landscape buffer. 
b.  The existing trees and vegetation within the required corridor landscape buffer shall be retained, if healthy, as determined by a certified arborist or landscape architect, and shall count toward the minimum landscaping requirements of subsection 5.a. However, if the buffer area does not already contain sufficient vegetation to meet the minimum required by subsection 5.a, new trees and shrubs meeting the standards of subsection 5.b shall be planted. 
c.  The landscaped buffer area shall count toward the development's minimum required open space. 
d.  The landscape buffer area shall not be disturbed the purposes of using the area for stormwater management. 
e.  The applicant shall submit to the city a tree survey and a tree report of the site prepared by a certified arborist. The survey shall show the location and size of all existing trees two inches in diameter or greater measured at four and one-half feet above ground level to be saved or removed. The report shall address the current disposition (health) of the trees within the site and identify trees within the buffer area that are dead, dying, or diseased to the extent they cannot be saved. Affected tree(s) may be removed if any one of these conditions is verified by the city. Potential removal of dead, dying or diseased trees shall be in accordance with section 604.051 (tree preservation) requirements. 
f.  Fences, walls, or berms are not allowed within any landscape buffer, but may be located just outside the boundary of the buffer within the site. No grade changes or fill shall be allowed within the landscape buffer. 
g.  Development along SR 44 within the COZ boundaries shall be designed to prevent the need for fill material or such other treatment which would remove or harm existing trees within required buffer areas. Access driveways are exempt from this requirement. 
h.  If retaining walls are used as part of the development, they shall be placed behind the landscape buffer adjacent to the development. No grade changes or fill shall be allowed within the landscape buffer. 
7.  Irrigation. Required buffers that contain existing dense vegetation with existing trees left in undisturbed conditions shall not be required to be irrigated. However, when natural vegetation is disturbed, the buffer shall be irrigated as required in article VI development design and improvement standards. 
8.  Parking lot landscaping. 
a.  Off-street parking and loading areas shall not be permitted in any required landscaped buffer areas. 
b.  Vehicle use areas located between the building and SR 44 or US-1, within the COZ, shall meet the following: 
i.  A minimum of 30 percent of the vehicular use area shall be landscaped. All other interior vehicular use areas shall meet a 20 percent landscaping requirement. "Vehicle use area" refers to the area used for parking or displaying vehicles, and includes all parking/display spaces, driveways, driving aisles, landscape strips and landscape islands (see figure below). 
ii.  Landscape islands shall have a minimum width of ten feet. 
Figure 3. Vehicular Use Area

9.  Clearing of easements. Preserved vegetation within required easements does not count towards the required buffer landscape requirements. All required landscape buffer plantings shall be placed outside the utility easement. However, required drainage and utility easements shall not be cleared of existing vegetation until the city or the utility company is ready to install infrastructure within the affected easement at which point clearing of existing vegetation within the easement will only be to the extent necessary to accommodate the installation of the infrastructure as determined by the agency installing it. The city and utility companies shall utilize trenchless technology where applicable in order to minimize disturbance to existing landscaping within the buffer. Required easements shall comply with LDR section 1007.00, plat requirements, part D. 
10.  Site development plan review requirements. Development within the COZ district shall follow the site plan review requirements stated in this LDR. The technical review staff shall review proposed development plans to assure compliance and consistency with the standards of this section.

    A minimum 5-foot wide landscaping buffer is required around the perimeter of all parking areas. Only driveways may be located within this buffer. 
    Except for access driveways, it is intended that development shall be designed to prevent the need for fill material or such other treatment which would remove or harm existing trees within required yards or buffers. 
    Existing trees shall remain in low areas and may be included in stormwater retention areas because they are accustomed to an environment where their root system is periodically inundated. 
    Existing trees with a minimum height of nine feet and diameter of two inches when measured four feet above ground level shall remain in landscaped buffer areas. If a tree is dead, dying, or is diseased to the extent it cannot be saved, it may be removed if any one of these conditions is verified by a horticulturist with credentials approved by the development services director or his/her designee. 
    Required buffers that contain dense vegetation with existing trees shall be left natural and shall not be required to be irrigated if undisturbed. 
    Required landscape buffers shall contain the following number of plantings for every 100 linear feet of the buffer:

    When natural vegetation is disturbed, the buffer shall be irrigated as required in [sub]section 604.05 of this LDR. 
    Landscape buffer requirements-All other areas. 
    Requirements presented in [sub]section 604.05 shall apply except that more stringent requirements described for landscape buffering herein shall supersede. 
    A minimum of 20-foot wide landscaping buffer is required around the perimeter of the project site except where a larger landscaped buffer is required within this LDR. Only driveways, sidewalks and bike paths may be located within this buffer. 
    Properties required to provide a 25-foot utility easement per [sub]section 604.03 of this LDR shall overlap the landscape buffer with the utility easement by ten feet, with the utility easement being adjacent to the right-of-way and the landscape buffer being interior to the utility easement. All required buffer plantings shall be placed outside the easement, with the exception that those species of trees that will not exceed 20 feet in height at maturity may be placed within the ten-foot overlap area. Permitted trees in the overlap area are listed in [sub]section 604.04. Properties must comply with the minimum 20-foot landscape buffer requirements as provided in this paragraph, but may negotiate less of the buffer overlapping the utilities easement, thus providing a greater amount of buffer outside of the utilities easement area. 
    A minimum of 30 percent of the area of the site shall be covered by existing dense vegetation with trees or by additional shrubs and trees as referenced herein (for buffers) to create dense vegetative growth. 
    Except for access driveways, it is intended that development shall be designed to prevent the need for fill material or such other treatment which would remove or harm existing trees within required front and corner yards. 
    Existing trees shall remain in low areas and may be include din stormwater retention areas because they are accustomed to an environment where their root system is periodically inundated. 
    Existing trees with a minimum height of nine feet and diameter of two inches when measured four feet above ground level, shall remain in landscaped buffer areas. If a tree is dead, dying, or is diseased to the extent it cannot be saved, it may be removed if any one of these conditions is verified by a horticulturist with credentials approved by the development services director or his/her designee. 
    Required buffers that contain dense vegetation with existing trees shall be left natural and shall not be required to be irrigated if undisturbed. 
    If the buffer area has sparse vegetative growth, or is devoid of significant vegetation and trees, additional shrubs and trees shall be planted as noted thereafter. 
    Shrubs. Plants shall be placed no more than three feet apart measured from center to center and a minimum of two feet in height, immediately after planting. 
    Trees. One tree shall be provided for each 100 square feet thereof. Tree species shall be a minimum of nine feet in height and have a minimum diameter of two inches when measured four feet above ground level. Also, trees planted within 12 feet of publicly maintained streets or other improvements shall be selected from the New Smyrna Beach Tree List that can be obtained from the city horticulturist. 
    When natural vegetation is disturbed, the buffer shall be irrigated as required in [sub]section 604.05 of this LDR. 
    Supplementary regulations. The following regulations apply to all PUD zoning classifications unless a specific classification is referenced: 
(1)  Unified ownership. All land within the PUD shall be under the ownership of one person, either by deed, agreement for deed, or contract for purchase.

a.  City technical staff review: Upon receipt of a completed application package, city technical review staff will meet with the applicant as provided in section 302 to review the proposed rezoning to PUD. At the meeting, city technical review staff may provide the applicant with written and verbal comments about the written development agreement and conceptual development plan, including any actions required to conform the plan to City code and any actions that might be taken to improve the quality of the proposed development. 
b.  After receiving comments from the city technical review staff, the applicant shall revise the proposed agreement and supporting documents and submit revised documents to the planning and engineering department. City technical review staff shall review the revised documents to ensure that all comments have been addressed. If all of the comments have not been addressed, staff shall submit a list of remaining outstanding comments to the applicant. The applicant shall then revise the agreement and supporting documents to address all the technical review staff comments. 
When all comments have been addressed, the item shall be scheduled for the next available planning and zoning board meeting. Planning and engineering department staff shall then prepare a written report and recommendation to the planning and zoning board. Said recommendation shall be either denial, approval, or approval with conditions. 
c.  Planning and zoning board review. Upon receipt of the development services department staff recommendation, the planning and zoning board, at a regularly scheduled meeting, shall review and make a recommendation to the city commission pertaining to the proposed zone change. Said recommendation shall be either denial, approval, or approval with conditions. 
d.  City commission review. Upon receipt of the planning and zoning board recommendation, the city commission, at a regularly scheduled meeting, shall review and either deny, approve, or approve with conditions, the proposed zone change. 
Should the city commission deny the request, the developer shall not pursue developing the subject property in the proposed manner for a minimum of one calendar year. Should the city commission approve the zone change, the official zoning map shall then be changed to reflect the rezoning and the developer may proceed with subdivision or site plan review. Should the city commission approve the zone change with conditions, the official zoning map change and subdivision or site plan review can commence once the conditions have been met. 
All planned unit developments shall be approved by the city commission by ordinance approving the PUD in the same manner as required for a rezoning and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. 
e.  Subdivision and/or site plan review. No property zoned PUD shall be developed without site plan and/or subdivision review and approval with the exception of developing single-family and two-family dwellings on individual lots previously and properly subdivided. An applicant may request a PUD rezoning concurrently with subdivision and/or site plan review and approval. Should an applicant request concurrent PUD rezoning and subdivision and/or site plan review and approval, the site plan and/or subdivision, which obtains final approval by the planning and zoning board, is automatically made contingent upon any conditions the city commission makes. The applicant hereby assumes the risk of receiving concurrent PUD rezoning approval and subdivision and/or site plan approval. All site plans and subdivisions must be consistent with approved PUD rezonings. 
f.  Amendments to PUD site plans and subdivision proposals after PUD rezoning approval. No site plan or subdivision may deviate from approved PUD rezoning without another development services department staff and planning and zoning board review and recommendation and city commission review and approval. An exception to the above is minor changes such as the location of buildings, drainage systems, and parking lots, and the lowering of densities, intensities and impacts of the development may be approved by the planning and zoning board during subdivision or site plan review and approval. 
g.  Issuing building permits. Building permits shall be issued on any PUD zoned land with an approved site plan or subdivision and a certificate of zoning prior to the beginning of construction. 
(5)  Non-delegation of police powers and legislative authority. 
a.  The entry into a master planned unit development (PUD) development agreement (MDA) by the city shall in no way whatsoever limit or modify any legislative power by the city to adopt ordinances, resolutions, regulations, or to make executive, administrative or legislative decisions of any kind which it had the power to make prior to the entry of such master planned unit development (PUD). 
b.  The submission of a request for consideration of a master planned unit development (PUD) development agreement (MDA), the city commission's willingness to pursue discussions, the resultant negotiations regarding a master planned unit development (PUD) development agreement (MDA), the payment of any application fees for the submission of any applications, engineering plans, surveys, and any other expenditures or efforts in prosecution of the master planned unit development (PUD) development agreement (MDA) provided for herein by a parcel of land owner, shall not vest any rights whatsoever in any zoning or land use designation in such parcel of land owner, or other individual, nor shall it in any manner whatsoever limit the city commission from undertaking any zoning or land use plan amendments that it would otherwise legally be entitled to undertake. 
c.  To the extent that any provision of any development agreement shall be inconsistent with the city's vested right's ordinance, the city's vested rights ordinance shall control over the inconsistent provision in the development agreement. See, New Smyrna Beach, Fla., Ordinance 36-96 (January 8, 1997). 
d.  To the extent that any provision of any development agreement shall be inconsistent with the city's adopted comprehensive plan that was in force at the time the development agreement was approved, the city's adopted comprehensive plan that was in force at the time the development agreement was approved shall control over the inconsistent provision in the development agreement. 
e.  The city shall take into account before approving any amendment to any development agreement any and all changes in conditions that have occurred on the subject property and surrounding area between the time the agreement was first approved and time the amendment has been requested. See generally, City of New Smyrna Beach v. Andover Development Corp., 672 So.2d 618 (5th DCA 1996). 
HBOD, HISTORIC BUILDING OVERLAY DISTRICT 
    Intent. The intent of the HBOD, Historic Building Overlay District is to provide re-use opportunities for significant historic structures located in zoning districts wherein the evolution of zoning use restrictions and other zoning regulations have over the years either rendered the historic structures completely unusable, or significantly limited any practical uses of the historic structures. This overlay district seeks to promote the preservation, restoration and reuse of historic and architecturally significant structures by exempting these historic structures from the underlying zoning district's use and district regulations, so long as, these structures are redeveloped under plans for redevelopment that insure that these structures are compatible with their surrounding neighborhoods. 
    District regulations. Buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places, buildings eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, properties containing a structure identified as a contributing structure in the city's historic districts, and properties that have been designated as local landmarks in this overlay district are exempt from all of the underlying zoning district's land use and other district regulations, so long as, each deviation from the normally applicable land use and other district regulations is consistent with the city's comprehensive plan, compatible with the surrounding neighborhood, and reasonably necessary to preserve the historic resource. No property in this overlay district may deviate from the underlining [underlying] zoning district's regulations without first submitting a plan for the development of the property to the city and obtaining a determination from the city commission that each proposed deviation from the underlying zoning district's land use and other district regulations as shown on the plan for the development of the property is consistent with the city's comprehensive plan, compatible with the surrounding neighborhood, and is reasonably necessary to preserve the historic resource. The city commission shall approve the establishment of historic overlay districts and plans for the development of the properties by ordinance in the same manner it approves rezonings. A historic overlay district and plan for the development of the property once approved may only be amended by ordinance in the same manner as a rezoning. All development on properties within this district shall be in accordance with the approved plan for the development of the property, or comply with the underlying zoning district's regulations. 
    Application. Persons seeking approval of a historic building overlay district zoning and a plan for the development of the property shall make application to the development services department. The application shall be on forms provided by the development services department and shall include all of the below information and any other information the applicant feels is relevant: 
(1)  Plan for development of the property. 
(2)  Legal description. 
(3)  Proposed use. 
(4)  Statement as to why the proposed use cannot be accommodated under the existing zoning. 
(5)  A site plan showing property boundaries, the location of all existing and proposed buildings, parking, buffers, and any other essential elements of the proposed site use. 
(6)  An elevation of the building showing the building height, how the structure is to be preserved and how any proposed additions will continue the historic character of the structure. 
(7)  A schedule showing the timing of proposed improvements. 
The development services department shall review the application and determine if the application is complete. Once the development services department has determined the application is complete, it shall transmit the application to the planning and zoning board and the historic preservation commission for their reviews and recommendations to the city commission. The planning and zoning board shall provide recommendations on the physical development of the site and the expected impact on adjacent properties and the neighborhood. The historic preservation commission shall provide its recommendation as to the historic and architectural significance of the building and site. Upon the planning and zoning board and the historic preservation commission completing their reviews and recommendations, the application shall be transmitted to the city commission for its consideration. 
    Approval of the historic overlay district and plan for development. The city commission shall approve the ordinance establishing the historic overlay district and plan for the development of the property if both the district and plan are consistent with the city's comprehensive plan, compatible with the surrounding neighborhood, and are reasonably necessary to preserve the historic resource. The property's approved plan for the development of the property shall constitute the property's zoning district's regulations. The city commission shall not establish a historic overlay district without at the same time approving a plan for the development of the property. The city commission shall establish a time certain for completion of development on the property in accordance with the approved plan for the development of the property. The historic overlay district shall be automatically repealed and the approved plan for the development of the property shall automatically expire without requiring any further action by the city in the event that the property owner fails to complete the redevelopment of the property and secure a certificate of occupancy for the property prior to the date set by the city commission for completion of the development of the property. 
WHOD, WORKFORCE HOUSING OVERLAY DISTRICT 
    Purpose and intent. The intent of the Workforce Housing Overlay District is to provide regulatory incentives for developers to construct single-family, two-family and multi-family dwelling units that are affordable to eligible purchasers whose household income is at or below 120 percent of the median income for Volusia County. It is suitable for large and small infill projects. The WHOD is also suitable as a buffer between single-family and multi-family developments and non-residential districts. This overlay district seeks to promote the construction of housing affordable to the city's workforce by (1) exempting workforce housing developments from the underlying zoning district's dimensional requirements, with the exceptions noted below, and (2) by allowing additional affordable housing bonus units to be constructed in compliance with provisions in the city's comprehensive plan. The city commission, with a recommendation from the planning and zoning board, shall make the final determination as to whether an individual development proposal is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. 
    District regulations. Persons seeking approval within a Workforce Housing Overlay District and a plan for the development of the property shall make application to the development services department. The application shall be on forms provided by the development services department and shall include all of the below information and any other information required by staff. Information marked with an asterisk (*) must be provided in the form of a development agreement between the property owner and the city. 
1.  Zoning of the property*; 
2.  Number of affordable housing units*; 
3.  Survey of the property; 
4.  Legal description*; 
5.  Conceptual elevation drawings of the proposed building*; 
6.  Conceptual floor plans for the proposed units*; 
7.  Draft homeowners' association documents; 
8.  Information on homeowners' association fees; 
9.  Information on the construction costs per unit*; 
10.  Information on the sales price per unit*; 
11.  Information on who will oversee the sale and resale of the units and who will be responsible for verifying income of potential buyers*; 
12.  A statement that the unit may not be resold for more than five percent above its initial purchase value per year, and that such increase may be prorated over the course of a year*; 
13.  A statement indicating that the income and resale restrictions shall remain in place for the life of the unit*; 
14.  Draft copies of the proposed covenants and restrictions that will govern the maintenance of the common open space and other aspects of the project that are necessary for welfare of the project and consistent with the best interests of New Smyrna Beach. Such legal instruments shall be submitted with the site plan and approved by the city legal department prior to the issuance of a building permit by the chief building official. At a minimum, these documents should include the following information: 
a.  A statement that the unit may not be resold for more than five percent above its initial purchase value per year, and that such increase may be prorated over the course of a year; and 
b.  A statement indicating that the income and resale restrictions shall remain in place for the life of the unit; 
15.  A conceptual plan showing proposed setbacks, building footprints and proposed parking and storm water retention areas*; 
16.  A schedule showing the timing of proposed improvements and project*; and 
17.  The required application fee as determined by resolution of the city commission. 
    The development services department shall review the application and determine if the application is complete. Once the development services department has determined the application is complete, it shall transmit the application to the planning and zoning board for its review and recommendation to the city commission. The planning and zoning board shall provide recommendations on the physical development of the site, the expected impact on adjacent properties, and compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood. Upon the planning and zoning board completing its review and recommendation, the application shall be transmitted to the city commission for its consideration. 
    Public notification procedures shall be the same as those outlined in section 305.01 of this code for rezoning of property. 
    Maximum density. The maximum density shall be calculated adding the number of units allowed by the base density to the number of affordable housing bonus units allowed. The number of units shall be calculated as follows: 
Base Density: The number of units allowed by multiplying the size of the subject property by the maximum density allowed by the underlying Future Land Use designation. 
Bonus Density: If the property is 1.0 acres or less in size, only one affordable housing bonus unit may be built. If the property is greater than one acre, the developer may construct up to an additional 20 percent of the number of base density units as affordable housing bonus units. 
Example: The subject property is two acres in size and has a Future Land Use designation of high density residential, which allows up to 18 units/acre on the mainland. The applicant's base density would be 36 units (18 units/acre × 2 acres). In addition to the base density, the applicant would be entitled to a bonus density of up to seven affordable housing bonus units (36 base density units × 20 percent). 
    Approval of the Workforce Housing Overlay District and Plan for Development. 
    The city commission shall approve the ordinance establishing the Workforce Housing Overlay District and plan for the development of the property if both the district and plan are consistent with the city's comprehensive plan, compatible with the surrounding neighborhood, and will provide housing affordable to future residents earning up to 120 percent of the median income of Volusia County. The property's approved plan for development shall constitute the property's zoning district regulations. The city commission shall not establish a Workforce Housing Overlay District without at the same time approving a plan for the development of the property. The city commission shall establish a time certain for completion of development on the property in accordance with the approved plan for the development of the property. The Workforce Housing Overlay District shall be automatically repealed and the approved plan for the development of the property shall automatically expire without requiring any further action by the city in the event that the property owner fails to complete the development of the property; to provide housing within the approved price range; or to secure a certificate of occupancy for the property prior to the date set by the city commission for completion of the development of the property. 
    Following issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the developer must submit to the development services department an annual report detailing the following information: 
(1)  The number of units that were sold; 
(2)  The household income of the purchaser(s) of the unit(s); 
(3)  The sale or resale price of the unit(s); 
(4)  Verification that all units were owner-occupied. 
    Expiration of the Workforce Housing Overlay District. This ordinance shall expire two years from the date of approval by the city commission unless the city commission approves an extension.

505.00. - Nonconformance. 
    505.01. Types of nonconforming status. Within the districts established by this LDR or amendments that may later be adopted there may exist: 
A.  Lots; 
B.  Uses of land and structures; and 
C.  Structures; 
which were lawful before this LDR was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted, under the terms of this LDR or future amendment. It is the intent of this LDR to permit these nonconformities to continue in their present condition subject to the following requirements. 
    505.02. Nonconforming lots of record. 
A.  In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption of this LDR provided such lot meets the intent of [sub]section 505.01 above. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area, width or depth, as generally applicable in the district; however, the lot shall conform to all other regulations for the district in which such lot is located, and the minimum width shall be 50 feet or more. 
B.  Any lot platted as part of a recorded subdivision shall be considered buildable, provided that the requirements for pervious; impervious; building setbacks; and all other regulations for the district are met. 
    505.03. Nonconforming uses. Where, at the effective date of adoption of amendment of this LDR, lawful use of land or buildings exists which would not be permitted under the regulations imposed by this LDR such uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided: 
A.  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this LDR; 
B.  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this LDR; 
C.  No additional structure, not conforming to the requirements of this LDR shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
    505.04. Existing single-family residential uses. Where, at the adoption of ordinance 832 (November 9, 1971), a single-family residential use existed as the principle use on a platted lot of record, and said single-family residential use has not, since the adoption of this LDR, been abandoned, as evidenced by demolition of the structure, or conversion to any other use defined and recognized under this LDR, said aforedescribed single-family residential use is, and shall hereafter, remain lawful notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in this LDR and shall be considered conforming. 
    505.05. Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful permitted structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this LDR that could not be built under the terms of this LDR by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
A.  No such nonconforming structure may be altered or enlarged, except that where an enlargement or alteration is proposed in required yard space which contains an existing nonconforming structure, and where the existing setback is five feet or greater, the enlargement or alteration of the said nonconforming structure may be permitted so long as the existing setback is not further reduced by the enlargement or alteration, and provided all other applicable district regulations are complied with. 
B.  Should such nonconforming structure, or nonconforming portion of structure, be destroyed by any means other than deterioration through time, to an extent of more than 50 percent of its appraised value at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this LDR. 
C.  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
D.  A structure having a nonconforming setback may be added onto providing the addition is not proposed on the side of the structure having a nonconforming setback or the addition is on the side of the structure having the nonconforming setback and the addition maintains the required setback. 
    505.06. Change in use. 
A.  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or of a structure and premises in combination, may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same character, or to a more restrictive but nonconforming use, provided the planning and zoning board shall find, after public notice and hearing, that the proposed use is equal or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use, and that the relation of the structure to surrounding properties, is such that adverse effects on occupants and neighboring properties will not be greater than if the existing nonconforming use is continued. In permitting such change, the planning and zoning board may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the intent and purpose of this LDR. The planning and zoning board shall not be limited in the number of times it may consider the same application. Administrative res judicata shall not apply to decisions of the planning and zoning board under this provision. 
B.  Upgrade of site improvements for existing development. The following activities shall require the upgrade of existing site improvements to satisfy current code requirements. Such upgrade shall include, but not be limited to, the provision of paved, curbed and expanded parking facilities, stormwater retention, landscaping and buffers, irrigation, signage and architectural design as prescribed by this Code. The administrative official may waive some or all of these required improvements based upon the extent of the proposed activity and the condition of the existing site development. 
(1)  Change of use as described by the building code, the Standard Industrial Classification Manual or when determined to be of significance by the administrative official. 
(2)  Re-use of any site development which has been abandoned as described by this Code. 
(3)  Substantial improvement to the property which requires class II or class III site plan approval. 
(4)  As a condition for granting approval of a special exception, variance or change of one non-conforming use to another non-conforming use for existing site developments when appropriate. 
    505.07. Repairs and maintenance. On any nonconforming structure, or portion of a structure, containing a nonconforming use, repairs and modernization are permitted provided that the cubic content or area existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. Nothing in this LDR shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building, or part thereof declared to be unsafe, by any public official charged with protecting the public safety upon order of such official. 
    505.08. Abandonment of nonconforming uses. Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a period of one year, such use shall not thereafter be re-established, and any future use, shall be in conformity with the provisions of this LDR. For the purposes of this section, discontinued shall mean no occupational license is, or has been, active or paid for or no resident has lived in a dwelling unit. 
    505.09. Uses under special exception provisions not nonconforming uses. Any use which is permitted as a special exception in a district under the terms of this LDR shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall without further action, be considered a conforming use. 
    505.10. Nonconforming front yard setback. The front yard setback requirements of this LDR shall not apply on any lot where the average setback of existing buildings located wholly, or in part, within 100 feet on each side of such lot within the same block and zoning district, and fronting on the same side of the street, is less than the minimum required setback. In such cases, the setback on such lot may be less than the required setback, but no less than the average of the setbacks of the aforementioned existing buildings. [Sub]section 504.01M. shall override this provision.

Such records shall be retained for at least ten years. 
e.  Failure to provide notification of a release as provided above is a violation of this section. 
(10)  Violations, enforcement and penalties. 
a.  Violations. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision of this section or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this section. Any person who has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this section shall be subject to appropriate enforcement actions consistent with the ordinances of the City of New Smyrna Beach and all other applicable laws, rules and regulations. 
b.  Notice of violation. Whenever the city finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this section, the city shall order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. 
The notice of violation shall contain: 
i.  The name and address of the alleged violator; 
ii.  The address, when available, or a description of the building, structure or land upon which the violation is occurring or has occurred; 
iii.  A statement specifying the nature of the violation; 
iv.  A description of the remedial measures necessary to restore compliance with this section and a time schedule for the completion of such remedial action; 
v.  A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall be assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed; 
vi.  A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to the city by filing a written notice of appeal to the city's code enforcement board within seven days of service of notice of violation; and 
vii.  A statement specifying that should the violator fail to restore compliance within the established time schedule, the city may undertake either or both of the following steps: 
(a)  Disconnect the premises from the MS4; 
(b)  With the written permission of the property owner, or upon a lawful order, direct city personnel or a licensed contractor hired by the city to enter upon the premises, undertake the required work, and charge the expenses thereof to the violator. 
Such notice of violation shall require, without limitation, one or more of the following: 
i.  The performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting; 
ii.  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 
iii.  The ceasing and desisting of all violating discharges, practices or operation; 
iv.  The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; 
v.  Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs, with a lien placed against the violator's premises should the fine go unpaid after 30 days; and 
vi.  The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. 
c.  Emergency cease and desist orders. When the city determines that any person has violated or continues to violate any provision of this section or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that the person's violation(s) has or have caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4, watercourses or receiving waters which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the city shall issue an order to the violator directing the violator to immediately cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to: 
i.  Immediately comply with all permit, ordinance and other requirements of law; and 
ii.  Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Any person notified of an emergency order directed to him or her under this subsection shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4, watercourses, or receiving waters, and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The city may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this section. A person that is responsible in whole or in part for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city within three days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the violator. 
d.  Immediate suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The city shall, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4, watercourses, or receiving waters. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the City of New Smyrna Beach shall take such further steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4, watercourses or receiving waters, or to minimize danger to persons, with all costs and expenses thereof borne by the violator. 
e.  Civil penalties, costs. In the event the alleged violator fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within the time set forth in the notice, and either fails to appeal or is unsuccessful on appeal, the city may impose a penalty not to exceed $250.00. Repeat violations shall carry a fine not to exceed $500.00. For the purposes of this section, each day shall constitute a separate violation for each day the violation remains unremediated after receipt of the notice of violation. In addition to such civil penalties, the city shall have the authority to assess against the violator the actual costs incurred by the city to correct violations of this section with the right to lien the violator's premises for any unpaid costs. 
(11)  Appeal of notice of violation. Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the violation to the city's code enforcement board. The notice of appeal must be received within seven days from the date of service of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the code enforcement board shall take place within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the board shall be final. 
(12)  Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or in the event of an appeal, within seven days of the decision of the code enforcement board upholding the decision of the city, then the city shall undertake those actions pursuant to subsection (10)b.vii. above, take corrective action and place a lien on the property of the owner for the costs and expenses thereof. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow duly authorized enforcement agents of the city or its designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth herein. Pursuant to subsection (15) below, these remedies are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law. 
(13)  Violations deemed a public nuisance. In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided in this section, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this section is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed to be a public nuisance, and such condition may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense, or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be undertaken. 
(14)  Ultimate responsibility. The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this section are minimum standards; therefore this section does not intend nor does it imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination, pollution or unauthorized discharge of pollutants. Every person bears ultimate responsibility for any contamination or pollution discharged in the MS4, the waters of the United States or other watercourses within the city. 
(15)  Compatibility with other regulations. This section is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this section are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulations or other provisions of law, and where any provision of this section imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes high protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
(16)  Remedies not exclusive. The remedies provided for in this section are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law, and it is within the discretion of the city to seek cumulative remedies. The city may recover all attorney fees, court costs, costs of remediation, and other expenses associated with enforcement of this section, including sampling and monitoring expenses, with interest. The city shall have the right to establish a lien against the violator's premises for all unpaid expenses incurred in remedying violations of this section, and may utilize any other method or procedure provided by law or ordinance for imposition and collection of the lien.

(3)  Agriculture zoning classifications. Trees located on agricultural cultivation or grazing land, or on commercial plant nursery sites are exempt from the provisions of this section. This provision shall apply in the A-1, A-2 and FR zoning districts, and property on which trees were planted and grown for sale to the general public or some public purposes, and licensed plant or tree nurseries, and botanical gardens (See, section 169(a)(5) [of the] Volusia Code of Ordinances). The exemption in this provision shall be subject to the following condition. Any property owner who removes or destroys trees from agricultural cultivation or grazing land, or commercial plant nursery sites within three years of filing an application for rezoning to a non-agricultural classification, applying for subdivision approval, or filing for special exception approval shall be presumed to have performed such removal or destruction of trees with the intent of developing the land for a non-agricultural use and shall not be exempt from the provisions of this section. Said presumption shall be a legally rebuttable presumption. The property owner shall have rebutted the presumption that the removal or destruction of trees on his property was with the intent of developing the land for a non-agricultural use by filing a sworn and notarized affidavit with the city attesting that any trees that were removed in the past three years from the subject property were removed in conformity with recognized agricultural management or production practices and not merely for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of this section. The affidavit filed by the property owner may be challenged by the city within 30 days of filing the affidavit. In the event that the city elects to challenge the property owner's affidavit, the exemption may be denied by the city upon showing by substantial competent evidence that the trees were not removed in conformance with recognized agricultural management or production practices. The city shall have the burden of proof to refute the affidavit filed by the property owner. Any decision to deny an exemption under this provision shall be in writing, state the factors considered in denying the exemption, state the reasons for denying the exemption, and be signed by the city manager or his designee. The city shall consider, among any and all other relevant factors, the following when reviewing any request for an exemption under this provision: 
a.  The specific reasons stated by the property owner for removal of the trees. 
b.  The length of time the land has been in agricultural production. 
c.  Whether the agricultural use has been continuous. 
d.  The size of the area as it relates to efficient agricultural production. 
e.  Whether the land has been sufficiently and adequately cared for within accepted commercial practices of the dominant type of production. 
f.  Whether the land is under lease and if so, the type and terms of said lease. 
g.  Whether the tree removal was done in the ordinary course of business. 
h.  Any contract for sale in existence at the time the affidavit is submitted. 
i.  Other factors that are relevant to the determination of good faith land use. 
The applicant shall submit with its application for an exemption to the tree replacement requirement copies of any and all contracts, agreements, deeds and all usual and customary business records that would be reasonably necessary for the city to review to determine whether or not the applicant is entitled to an exemption. The applicant shall not fraudulently withhold any document. 
See generally, section 169(a)(2) of the Volusia County Code of Ordinances. 
(4)  Reserved. 
B.  Replacement trees. 
(1)  Approved trees. Only the following trees shall be planted to meet the minimum tree requirements of this section and as replacement trees: 
See Exhibit "A" attached hereto and by reference made a part hereof. 
Historic and specimen trees shall be replaced with trees of like species unless like species are not reasonably available. 
(2)  Prohibited trees. The following trees may not be planted to meet the minimum tree requirements and shall be removed when new construction is undertaken on a parcel. 
All trees listed as Category I invasive species by the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council are prohibited. 
(3)  Replacement of trees shall be calculated based on the replacement of one-tenth of the total cross-sectional area of the trunk(s) of the protected tree(s) permitted for removal. Cross-sectional area shall be measured at the DBH of the tree. Single trees may be replaced with two or more trees meeting the standards as set forth in the following paragraph. For one and two-family residences, replacement trees are to be provided based on one replacement tree for each protected tree 12-inches or less DBH and two replacement trees for each tree in excess of 12-inches DBH. 
(4)  Replacement trees shall be a minimum of nine feet in height and have a minimum caliper of two and one-half inches when measured six inches above ground level. Replacement trees must be maintained in good condition. 
(5)  Replacement trees shall be selected from the tree list included as section B.(1), above. Historic and specimen trees must be replaced with trees of like species unless like species are not reasonably available. 
(6)  Palms may be used as replacement stock up to the full cross-sectional area of palms being removed from the site and for up to one-third of the cross-sectional area for replacement of non-palm species at the ratio of 16 square inches of replacement cross-sectional area of palms for each square inch of required non-palm species replacement. Where non-palm species are proposed as replacements for palm trees, the replacements shall be done according to the following chart: 
DBH of Palm DBH of 
Non-Palm 
Species 6 inches 1.5 inches 8 inches 2 inches 10 inches 2.5 inches 12 inches 3 inches 14 inches 3.5 inches 16 inches 4 inches  
(7)  When replacement trees are required, the replacement trees shall be provided prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. If there is no certificate of occupancy required for the site, then the replacement trees shall be installed within 60 days of the date when notice is provided that replacement trees are required. 
(8)  Survival of replacement trees shall be guaranteed for one year. Replacement trees that die during the first year after planting must be replaced. 
(9)  In the event that a property has existing tree canopy coverage of 30 percent or greater of the property, the property owner may elect to place required replacement trees on the public right-of-way immediately adjacent to the property owner's property, or on the publicly-owned neighborhood park or recreation area servicing the property owner's property. Said park or recreation area must be within the incorporated boundaries of the city. The type of trees to be planted and the location of the trees must be approved by the city department responsible for the operation of the public right-of-way, park, or recreation area. The city may grant permission when the proposed tree planting is accompanied by an approved landscape plan and associated maintenance and guarantee agreement between the developer requesting the plantings and the city department that would be responsible for the area in which the trees would be placed. This provision shall in no way affect a property owner's right to seek and receive a general variance granted by the planning and zoning board from the tree preservation requirements. 
(10)  Except as exempted in [sub]section 604.051(B)(9), above, tree replacement shall occur on-site, if there is adequate space to plant the replacement trees. If there is not sufficient space on-site, the developer shall then plant replacement trees within public rights-of-way immediately adjacent to the property owner's property, or on the publicly-owned neighborhood park or recreation area servicing the property owner's property, provided such park is within the incorporated boundaries of the city. If replacement trees cannot be placed within public rights-of-way or parks, the developer shall provide a payment to the city for the cost of the remaining replacement trees. The developer shall pay these fees into the city Tree Mitigation Fund. 
The cost of replacement trees shall be $500.00 per 2.5-inch caliper hardwood tree, measured six inches above grade level or 8-inch caliper palm tree measured four feet above grade. The cost per tree shall be reviewed beginning January 1st of each calendar year. Costs shall be based upon average costs per tree as established by local nurseries selling trees that meet the minimum size requirements outlined in this section. If needed, an amendment to the Code will be brought to the planning and zoning board in February of each calendar year. 
Funds deposited into the Tree Mitigation Fund shall be appropriated in accordance with the annual adopted budget of the city for, but not limited to, the following projects: 
 Planting native trees, shrubs and plants on city-owned property. 
 Purchasing environmentally sensitive land for permanent preservation.

 Designing and planting right-of-way beautification projects. 
C.  Tree protection during construction. 
(1)  Marking trees. Prior to the commencement of construction any tree or tree groups to be maintained shall be clearly marked and the markings shall remain in place during construction. Any land clearing equipment shall be operated in a manner as not to injure or destroy any trees designated to remain on the site. 
(2)  Temporary barriers. During the period of construction a temporary barrier at least three feet in height shall be formed a minimum of seven feet from the base of the tree or trees and it shall include at least 50 percent of the area under the drip line of the tree(s). (Driveways and parking areas may be placed under the branches of trees so long as the impervious surface does not exceed 50 percent of the total area under the drip line of the tree. The impervious area may not be located closer than six feet from the trunk of the tree.) 
(3)  Natural soil level. Except for palm trees, all trees and replacement stock shall have their natural soil level maintained. Tree wells and/or planter islands shall be provided if necessary to maintain the natural existing soil level. 
D.  Variances. The following variances shall be allowed as variances to the minimum tree standards provided for in this section. Variances shall be reviewed and approved by the development services director or his designee. 
(1)  Variances allowing removal without replacement. Trees may be removed without replacement for the following purposes: 
a.  Trees in areas needed for a septic tanks and drain field (must be approved by health department and the septic tank and drain field can not reasonably be moved to another location). 
b.  Trees in the areas that need to be de-mucked to stabilize soils. Future development on the property must comply with the general minimum tree standards.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this section, any tree that could fall on a residential structure is exempt from all city tree preservation requirements and may be removed at any time with the permission of the owner. To qualify for this exemption, the residential structure subject to being hit by the tree must be located on a lot zoned and used for single-family dwellings. The removal of a tree under this provision requires the tree owner's written authorization and a tree removal permit issued by the city. Trees removed under this provision are exempt from all tree replacement requirements. 
(2)  Public safety and sanitary exemptions. Trees may be removed without replacement for the following purposes: 
a.  Trees threatening air safety. 
b.  Trees in public rights-of-way for either construction or maintenance. (Note: Specimen trees on the public rights-of-way must be replaced with a replacement tree at the closest location on public right-of-way available. See section 50-169(4) of the Volusia Code of Ordinances.) 
c.  Trees interfering with the construction of utilities, so long as the removal of the trees does not reduce landscape buffer plantings below the minimum requirements. If the placement of utilities results in a reduction of plantings below the minimum buffer requirements, the plantings must be replaced by the person granted the tree removal permit for new development, or by the utility responsible for the removal of the trees for utility construction, reconstruction or maintenance on all other properties. The replacement rate shall be ten percent of the cross-sectional area of the trees to be removed. 
d.  Trees and vegetation posing a fire hazard which threaten life or property may be removed by written authorization of the fire chief or his designee. 
F.  Permitting. The tree removal application shall be made in the following manner: 
(1)  Sites requiring city technical review staff approval, (class II or class III site plans) shall be required to provide a survey of the property prepared by a surveyor registered with the State of Florida showing existing features of the property including elevations, buildings, structures, trees over six inches in trunk diameter at four feet above ground level, all Specimen and Historic trees, streets, utility easement right-of-ways, and land use. For properties east of the Indian River the survey must show trees over four inches in diameter at four feet above ground level. In lieu of a tree survey an applicant may submit any generally accepted method of calculating the number of trees, subject to approval by city technical review staff prior to application submittal.

(Ord. No. 96-15, § 1(Exh. A), 11-17-2015) 
    604.10. Sidewalks. 
A.  General requirements. 
(1)  All developments shall have a sidewalk plan included to enable pedestrians to access the building(s) and parking lot, parking spaces and other accessory components of the site without walking through landscaped areas. The sidewalk plan shall be designed to provide direct pedestrian traffic, shall assume the pedestrians will take the most direct path to their destination, and shall assume that reasonable pedestrians will travel through grass or landscaping, if able to, before walking great distances to stay on the sidewalk. 
(2)  All developments, whether new or additions, are required to install public sidewalks along all road frontage in front of their parcel within the right-of-way six inches from the right-of-way line. This is not required if a sidewalk exists. If a sidewalk exists but does not meet the width requirements, the developer shall add the required width. This provision shall not apply if a bicycle path (not lane) exists in front of the establishment. 
(3)  If a sidewalk is required under [sub]section 604.10(A)(2) but the construction of the sidewalk is determined to not be practical, as outlined in [sub]section 604.10(A)(4) below, then the property owner or permit applicant shall make a contribution to the sidewalk account in lieu of constructing the required sidewalk. The amount of the contribution shall be determined by multiplying the linear feet of that parcel's street frontage(s) (minus the width of any paved driveway and/or driveway apron) times the per linear foot contribution fee established pursuant to [sub]section 604.105 of this LDR. 
(4)  The decision of whether the construction of a sidewalk on a parcel is "not practical" shall be made by the city engineer or designee. In making such a decision, the city engineer or designee shall consider the following factors: 
a.  Whether an adopted neighborhood plan or the city's comprehensive plan mandates that sidewalks not be constructed within a particular neighborhood; or 
b.  Whether a sidewalk cannot be constructed without removing a historic or specimen tree within the right-of-way; or 
c.  Whether a stormwater drainage ditch or similar public utility infrastructure readily prevents the construction of a sidewalk and neither the infrastructure nor the proposed sidewalk can be reasonably relocated or altered to accommodate both the infrastructure and the sidewalk; or 
d.  Whether or not other unique or peculiar circumstances exist on a given parcel or development. 
(5)  In the event that it is determined that the construction of a sidewalk is "not practical" (as provided for in [sub]section 604.10(A)(4) and by the city engineer) and if the permit is being issued for a single-family residential home, the contribution to the sidewalk account shall not be required in any of the following instances: 
a.  The permit is issued for an affordable housing unit. For the purposes of this section, an affordable housing unit shall be determined as defined in article II of this LDR; or 
b.  The permit is issued for a single-family or two-family residential dwelling which meets all of the following criteria: 
1.  The single-family or two-family dwelling is located on a street functionally classified as a local road; and 
2.  The permit is for new construction or expansion of an existing single-family or two-family residential dwelling; and 
3.  There are no sidewalks on the local road within 500 feet of the single-family or two-family dwelling. This distance shall be measured linearly on the same side of the local road as the residence; and 
4.  The city's capital improvements plan does not include any plans for funding or construction of sidewalks on the local road within 500 feet in either direction of the single-family or two-family dwelling. This distance shall be measured linearly on the same side of the road as the residence. 
(6)  The minimum width of sidewalks located along all local streets is four feet and collectors and arterials shall have five feet wide sidewalks. Sidewalks located in multi-family or duplex developments shall have a minimum width of 30 inches provided they are used to access ten or less dwelling units. Sidewalks located within multi-family and duplex and nonresidential developments, where the sidewalk accesses more than ten dwelling units, shall have a minimum width of four feet. For the purpose of this section, access to residential development shall mean the only paved pathway to a building entranceway. All buildings shall have a sidewalk leading from the city right-of-way, public walkway or vehicular access way to the building entranceway. Stepping stones, gravel, or decorative rock shall not constitute a sidewalk. 
(7)  Sidewalks shall be constructed of 3,000 psi 28-day concrete with a minimum thickness of four inches except that a minimum of six inches is required at driveways. Sidewalks shall be reinforced with six-inch by six-inch and 10/10 wire mesh or contain fiberglass mesh within the ready mix. Wheelchair ramps for the handicapped shall be provided at all intersections and other points of pedestrian traffic flow. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 35-11, § 5, adopted June 28, 2011, renumbered former subsection 604.12 as subsection 604.10, as set out herein. 
    604.105. Sidewalk account. 
A.  There is hereby established a sidewalk account. The sidewalk account shall be used for the deposit, maintenance and distribution of all monetary contributions made in lieu of constructing a sidewalk pursuant to [sub]section 604.10(A) of this LDR. All contributions made to and interest derived from the sidewalk account shall be used solely for the purpose of constructing, repairing or replacing sidewalks or bicycle paths along or on public streets or on public property. 
B.  The sidewalk account fee shall be established from time to time by city commission resolution. The fee shall be calculated by multiplying the number of linear feet of street frontage where a sidewalk is required to be built times the prevailing construction costs as determined by the city engineer. 
    604.11. Bicycle facilities. 
A.  General requirements. 
(1)  Any development adjacent to an arterial or collector roadway shall provide a bike path along one side of the arterial or collector roadway in lieu of the public sidewalk. This provision shall not apply if bike lanes are provided. 
(2)  Bike paths shall be located within the roadway right-of-way and constructed to city, county, or state bike path specifications. If adequate area is not available within the right-of-way, the bicycle facility shall be constructed to city, county, or state specifications on private property and a public access easement shall be granted for the width of the bicycle facility. 
(3)  City specifications for a bicycle path are a minimum width of eight feet, a minimum limerock base thickness of four inches, and a minimum Type I asphaltic concrete pavement thickness of 1.5 inches. 
(4)  A bicycle path shall not be required for any development located adjacent to an arterial or collector roadway with an existing sidewalk or bicycle path located on the same side of the right-of-way as the proposed development. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 35-11, § 1, adopted June 28, 2011, repealed subsection 604.11, which pertained to permanent reference points. Additionally, § 5 of said ordinance renumbered former subsection 604.13 as subsection 604.11, as set out herein. 
    604.12. Signs. 
A.  Purposes, intent, and scope. The purpose of these sign regulations is to protect, preserve, and improve the character and appearance of the City of New Smyrna Beach; to provide ample opportunity to advertise in commercial and industrial areas while preventing excessive advertising which would have a detrimental effect on the character and appearance of those areas; to limit signs in non-commercial and non-industrial areas to protect the residential character and appearance of those areas; and to preserve the First Amendment rights of all persons subject to these regulations. 
It is intended that signs placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification, or for advertising a use conducted on that land or in that building, or to exercise the first amendment rights of the owner or occupant of that land or building, shall be deemed to be accessory and incidental to the land, building, or use. 
With respect to commercial signs, it is specifically intended, among other things, to avoid excessive competition and clutter among sign display in the demand for public attention. Therefore, the display of signs should be appropriate to the land, building, or use to which they are appurtenant and be adequate, but not excessive, for the intended purpose of identification or advertising. 
Signs commonly referred to as billboards, outdoor advertising, or poster panels, which advertise products or businesses not connected with the site on which they are located, are prohibited in accordance with the predominantly residential atmosphere of the community, such signs being most appropriate on open highways and roads where they do not detract from community character. 
B.  Prohibited signs. The following signs are prohibited in the City of New Smyrna Beach: 
Beacon light signs. 
Billboards. 
Flashing signs. 
Moving signs. 
Off-site signs except exempt bench signs. 
Pole signs. 
Roof signs. 
Snipe signs. 
Trailer/mobile signs. 
Traveling light signs. 
Signs which in any way simulate or appear to simulate emergency vehicles, traffic control signs, or devices, or directional, informational, or warning signs erected or maintained by any public body, or any railroad, public utility, or similar body. 
Private signs, whether temporary or permanent, placed on public property, except as expressly permitted by the appropriate public body. 
Signs containing any statements, words, or pictures of an obscene nature, that is, which are utterly without redeeming social value as determined by the community standard prevailing in New Smyrna Beach and the immediate surrounding area. 
Signs exceeding three square feet attached to passenger vehicles. 
Signs which in any way obstruct, cover, or block, any fire escape, window, or door, or which are attached to any fire escape or ventilation device. 
Signs which include pennants, ribbons, streamers, spinners, or wind-operated devices, except as provided herein. 
Signs designed to be visible from any part of the Atlantic Ocean beach area, or from any waterway within the City limits, with the following exceptions: 1) approved wall signs in MU, B-2, B-3, B-4, PUD, or CM zoning districts; and 2) signs complying with the exemption provision of this LDR. 
Commercial signs that are carried, waved, or otherwise displayed by persons ("sign walkers", "sign spinners", or "commercial mascots") either on public rights-of-way or in a manner visible from public rights-of-way. 
Signs located in the visibility triangle of any corner lot, except as provided herein. The visibility triangle shall be drawn using the street right-of-way lines and a line connecting them at points 25 feet from the intersection formed by such right-of-way lines, or signs which otherwise obstruct the view in any direction at a street intersection. 
Commercial signs attached to or painted on vehicles or trailers which are not regularly used as part of the advertised business and are obviously parked for the primary purpose of advertising to passing motorists or pedestrians.

ARTICLE VII. - STANDARDS FOR SITES WITH SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS 

701.00. - Sites containing wetlands. 
    701.01. Purpose and intent. It is the purpose and intent to provide for the protection, maintenance, enhancement and utilization of wetlands within the City of New Smyrna Beach and recognize the rights of individual property owners to use their lands in a reasonable manner. Also, citizens deserve the right to be afforded protection and purity of the waters of Volusia County and their associated wetland ecosystems. It is the policy of New Smyrna Beach to minimize the disturbance of wetlands in the city and to encourage their use only for the purposes which are compatible with their natural functions and environmental benefits. It is further the purpose and intent of these regulations to insure that there be no net loss of wetlands as defined herein. To this end, a wetland management plan shall be required as provided herein. 
    701.02. Consistency with Volusia County minimum standards for wetlands protection. Wetlands as regulated herein are consistent with the minimum standards for wetland protection as approved by the county council for Volusia County, Florida. 
    701.03. Permit requirements. 
A.  It is hereby unlawful for any person to engage in any activity which will remove, fill, drain, dredge, clear, destroy, or alter any wetland as defined herein without obtaining a wetland alteration permit from the city in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. It is the intent of this section that construction of a single-family dwelling on upland which does not alter by removing, filling, draining, dredging, clearing, or destroying any wetland shall not require a permit pursuant to this section. Appeal procedures in connection with the issuance of a wetland alteration permit is provided in [sub]section 701.17. 
B.  The city may adopt, or supplement, permit requirements or conditions issued from other federal, state, or regional permitting agencies for the same development. 
C.  In determining whether the development is permissible under the provisions of these regulations, the city shall consider, but not be limited to, the following criteria: 
(1)  The ability of the wetland to receive, store, and discharge surface water runoff so as to contribute to hydrological stability and control of flooding and erosion; 
(2)  The ability of the wetland to recharge the groundwater as demonstrated by reliable available information; 
(3)  The ability of the wetland to provide filtration and nutrient assimilation from surface water runoff; 
(4)  The ability of the wetland to provide habitat and significant ecological function in the life cycle for fish, wildlife, or other forms of animal or plant life; 
(5)  The ability of the wetland to function as an integral part of any waters, water body, or watercourse; 
(6)  The cumulative impacts of the proposed development on the wetland system in combination with other developments which have been or shall be proposed in the same drainage basin; 
(7)  The technical feasibility of any proposed wetland mitigation plans and the likelihood of their success in restoring or replacing the environmental benefit altered by the development; 
(8)  The capacity of the existing wetland to provide environmental benefits because of such factors as maturity, size, degree of prior alteration, physical relationship to other water systems, and adjacent land uses; 
(9)  The degree or magnitude of the impact of the proposed alteration on the wetland and how such impact shall be minimized through mitigation measures, either off-site or on-site, or both, and recommendations concerning the appropriate location of said mitigation; 
(10)  Whether, and the extent to which, a proposed project must be located within a wetland or water body in order to perform the project's basic functions; 
(11)  Whether the wetlands impacted by the proposed activity are protected or used in a manner which does not adversely impact their beneficial functions. 
    701.04 Application submittal. The city shall require an application for a wetland alteration permit and each application shall be reviewed by the environmental officer, EO or his/her duly authorized representative. A certificate of zoning is required in accordance with this LDR. Each application shall include, but is not limited to, the following: 
A.  A wetland management plan which shall include the following: 
(1)  A detailed description of all water bodies, watercourses, and wetlands on-site and a general description of wetlands immediately adjacent to the site and associated hydrologic conditions; 
(2)  A general description of the upland habitats on-site; 
(3)  A site survey to scale no greater than one inch equals 50 feet which identifies the landward extent of the wetland boundaries, buffer zones, existing and proposed conservation areas and adjacent off-site conservation areas; 
(4)  A detailed description of any proposed activity within the jurisdictional wetlands and buffer zones; 
(5)  A detailed analysis of on-site and/or off-site mitigation areas, if applicable; 
(6)  A plan for the control of erosion, sedimentation, and turbidity during and after construction which describes in detail the type and location of control measures, and provisions of maintenance; 
(7)  A detailed description of methods to be utilized in meeting the criteria listed in [sub]sections 701.03 and 104.02F.; 
(8)  A copy of all other federal, state, and regional permits and/or applications and conditions issued for the proposed project; and 
(9)  Other information which the EO may reasonably require to determine whether to approve the wetlands alteration permit. 
    701.05. Issuance of permits; conditions. 
A.  If the application meets the requirements of these regulations, the EO shall issue the permit and may attach appropriate conditions to the permit in order to comply with the standards of [sub]section 701.03 in these regulations. The EO may deny the permit if it does not meet such standards, stating the reasons thereof. 
B.  The wetlands alteration permit shall incorporate the conditions referenced in any permits issued by federal, state, or regional agencies. 
C.  The wetlands alteration permit issued pursuant to this article shall expire upon: 
(1)  The expiration of any federal permit required to alter wetlands, 
(2)  The expiration of any state permit required to alter wetlands, 
(3)  The expiration of any regional permit required to alter wetlands, or 
(4)  The expiration date as established by the EMD. 
    701.06. Performance standard. 
A.  There shall be no net loss of wetland function. 
B.  Any alteration of wetlands shall be mitigated in accordance with the requirements of [sub]section 701.10. 
C.  Wetlands shall be protected from sedimentation during development activities. 
D.  Wetlands shall be protected or used in a manner which does not adversely impact their beneficial functions as provided in [sub]section 104.02F. 
    701.07. Wetland identification. The applicant shall secure a determination from a biologist with credentials approved by the city manager or may request the city perform a survey pursuant to identifying wetlands as defined in these regulations. A fee shall be charged to the applicant for expenses incurred when a jurisdictional determination is performed by the city to identify wetland boundaries. If the proposed project requires a permit or multiple permits from the federal, state, or regional agencies, a jurisdictional determination shall not be required. The most restrictive wetland boundary determined by the permitting agency or agencies shall be accepted by the EO. 
    701.08. Environmental planning. Lands suitable for creation, acquisition, restoration or preservation of wetlands or wetland habitat systems, including adjacent upland habitat, shall be in accordance with the EMD and approved by the city commission. The purpose of such designation is to identify areas suitable for the off-site mitigation of the impacts of wetland alteration. Such lands may be on public or private property. 
    701.09. Mitigation requirements. 
A.  It is presumed that development activity will have an adverse affect upon wetlands, and that permit conditions are inadequate to avoid potential adverse environmental affects. If the applicant fails to overcome this presumption, then mitigation shall be required. The purpose of mitigation is to offset unavoidable environmental impacts. Mitigation plans should consider the function of existing natural resources and provide comparable functions after mitigation is completed. Mitigation plans should maximize the preservation of existing natural resources. The mitigation plans shall consider the following methods, in order of priority, in which they should be utilized: 
(1)  Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action; 
(2)  Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action or its implementation; 
(3)  Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment; 
(4)  Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action; 
(5)  Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments through creation of new wetlands, enhancement of existing wetlands or re-establishment of wetlands which are no longer functioning due to significant attention in the past. 
B.  Where all or part of a wetland is destroyed or substantially altered by development, a proposed mitigation plan shall include at least: 
(1)  A description of the wetland and buffer to be created or restored, which shall include, but not limited to, the type and functions of the wetland, the proposed mitigation ratios, species present or to be planted, plant density, anticipated source of plants, soils, and hydrologic regime; 
(2)  A plan for monitoring the success of a created or restored wetland; 
(3)  A detailed written estimate of the cost of the mitigation. The detailed estimate should include costs associated with earth moving, planting, consultant fees, and monitoring; 
(4)  A detailed plan describing the monitoring and methods of control and maintenance of exotic or nuisance vegetation; 
(5)  Monitoring and replacement to assure a survival rate of 80 percent wetland vegetation for a minimum of three years; 
(6)  An upland habitat as an adjacent buffer on mitigated sites, as provided in [sub]section 701.11. 
C.  An acceptable mitigation plan shall be reasonably and technically feasible. Mitigation through restoration of other degraded wetlands is preferred over wetland creation. 
D.  Mitigation should take place on-site or in close proximity thereto. 
E.  An applicant who carries out a compensatory mitigation plan shall grant a conservation easement on the newly created or restored wetland and buffer to protect it from future development. A legal mechanism other than a conservation easement may be deemed appropriate on a case by case basis to carry out the purpose of the subsection. 
F.  A mitigation plan approved by a federal, state, or regional agency shall be presumed to be acceptable to the EO, provided however, if no such mitigation plan is required by the approved permit from the federal, state, or regional agency, then the EO may require a mitigation plan in compliance with this section. 
G.  Mitigation should not contribute to the production of mosquitoes by creating mosquito larval habitat or by eliminating habitat for predatory fish. 
H.  The applicant shall be charged administrative fees for mitigation plans reviewed and approved by the city. 
    701.10. Mitigation ratio. The mitigation ratio for created or restored wetlands shall be at least one-to-one ratio unless the value of wetland based on its functional value is determined to warrant a greater or lesser ratio. 
    701.11. Buffer requirements. 
A.  A buffer of not less than 25 feet is required adjacent to and surrounding all wetlands. The buffer may coincide with the setback on a lot under the zoning regulations in effect or may coincide with wildlife corridors designated in a local government's comprehensive plan. However, said buffer shall not impede reasonable access to a body of water. 
B.  Activities or construction which do not have a significant adverse effect on the natural function of the buffer may be allowed within the buffer. Proposed activities within the buffer may be permitted in accordance with the requirements set forth herein. The activities or construction include, but are not limited to, pruning, planting of suitable native vegetation, removal of exotic and nuisance pioneer plant species, and the creation and maintenance of walking trails. 
    701.12. Exemptions. 
A.  Activities which are exempted from these regulations include: 
(1)  Nonmechanical clearing of vegetation from an area of less than ten percent of the wetland; 
(2)  Minor maintenance or emergency repair to existing structures of improved areas; 
(3)  Cleared walking trails having no structural components; 
(4)  Timber catwalks and docks four feet wide or less; 
(5)  Bona fide agricultural uses; 
(6)  Utility crossing; 
(7)  Maintenance, together with incidental dredge and fill activities in ditches, retention and detention areas, public road and other rights-of-way, and other related drainage systems; 
(8)  Bona fide mosquito control activities verified by the Volusia County Mosquito Control District; 
(9)  Wetland a half acre or smaller, provided, however, if the entire wetland exceeds this threshold for exemption whether on one or more lots, then the entire wetland is regulated as otherwise provided in these regulations; 
(10)  Activities within artificial wetlands which are created as part of a manmade treatment system. 
B.  A local government may, at its option, delete in whole or in part any of the above described exemptions, but in no case, shall the local government include any additional exemptions in its ordinance unless otherwise approved by the county council. 
    701.13. Enforcement. 
A.  The EO, CEO, EMD or other city employees shall have authority after due notification to enter upon privately owned land for the purpose of performing their duties under these regulations and may take, or cause to be made, such examinations, surveys, or sampling as deemed necessary. 
B.  Any city department shall have authority to conduct routine city business pursuant to enforcing these regulations and any permit issued; and any violation or threatened violation thereof by violation notices, administrative orders, and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees, and expenses in connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator. 
C.  Law enforcement officials or other officials having arrest or enforcement powers shall have authority to assist in enforcement. 
D.  Any person who commits, takes part in, or assists in any violation of any provision of these regulations shall be subject to prosecution pursuant to section 1-8 of the city Code. 
E.  In the event of a violation, the city shall have the power to order wetland restoration and creation measures or any other such measures consistent with [sub]sections 701.09 and 701.10 of these regulations for the damaged or destroyed wetland area by the person or agent responsible for the violation. The infraction shall be referred to the LDR enforcement board and appropriate fines levied. The city shall reserve the right to restore the affected wetland to its prior condition and the property owner shall be liable to the city for the cost of such action. 
F.  To guide restoration and creation actions, the EO shall have the power to order the violator to develop a plan as described in [sub]section 701.09 of these regulations for the approval of the EO. Where a proper plan is not prepared in an expedient manner, the city may have the plan prepared and the applicant shall be liable for its cost. 
In the event the city hires outside consultants to prepare a mitigation or restoration plan, the applicant shall be subject to both administrative and consultant fees. 
    701.14. Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended that these regulations repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing regulations, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where these regulations impose greater restrictions, the provisions of these regulations shall prevail. 
    701.15. Interpretation. The provision of these regulations shall be held to be minimum requirements in their interpretation and application. 
    701.16. Appeal. Within 30 days after any decision is made by the EO in the administration and interpretation of these regulations, but not thereafter, the applicant may appeal to the city manager who, may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the EO. Any decision by the city manager may be appealed to the city commission, who, by majority vote may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the city manager. Any decision by the city commission is subject for review by the circuit court. 
    701.17. Filing fee. The applicant shall pay a filing fee of $250.00 plus $10.00 for each acre of wetland or fraction thereof up to ten acres; plus $5.00 for each acre of wetland or fraction thereof over ten acres. No fee is required for constructing a single-family dwelling on upland zoned to allow such use where the land is not altered by removing, filling, draining, dredging, clearing, or destroying any wetland. 
    701.18. Suspension, revocation of permit. The chief building official may suspend or revoke a permit or issue a stop work order if the applicant has not complied with the conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of the work set forth in the permit. 
    701.19. Nonconforming activities. A regulated activity that was lawful before the passage of these regulations, but which is not in conformity with the provisions of these regulations, may be continued subject to the following: 
A.  No such activity shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in any way that increases its nonconformity with the provisions of these regulations; 
B.  If a nonconforming use or activity is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, any resumption of the activity shall require conformance to these regulations to the maximum extent that such conformance is physically and actively feasible; and

(1)  Special circumstances exist which are peculiar to the property or the waterway in question, making boat mooring or waterway access difficult; 
(2)  Strict application of the requirements set forth in [sub]section 803.04 would deprive the property owner of reasonable rights presently enjoyed by other nearby property owners; 
(3)  Special circumstances and conditions exist that do not result from the direct or indirect actions of the present property owner(s) or past property owners(s). This criterion shall not be satisfied if the present or past property owner created, to any degree, the hardship that is the subject of the variance request; 
(4)  Granting a variance from requirements of [sub]section 803.04 will not cause substantial detriment to the public welfare, safety, navigation or convenience; 
(5)  Granting a variation from requirements of [sub]section 803.04 will not constitute a grant of special privilege denied to other property owners. 
A property owner desiring a variance must submit an application to the planning and engineering department in the form prescribed by the planning and engineering department which clearly describes the reasons why the planning and zoning board should approve the variance request. The letter of request must explain how the circumstances pertaining to the property in question meet the criteria listed in [sub]section 803.04K. 
Upon receipt of a complete application for a variance, the planning and engineering department shall schedule and notice the matter for a quasijudicial variance hearing before the planning and zoning board within 30 days. An application shall be complete when the planning and engineering department receives an application that contains all the information required by regulations.

(1)  Reservation. Upon approval by the city commission, the allocated boat slip(s) shall be reserved for three years from the date of approval. Any reserved slips shall be removed from the excess slip pool and held in reserve during that three-year period. Any number of slips the applicant does not build during the above-referenced reservation period shall be returned to the excess slip pool. 
(2)  Construction. The applicant has three years from the date of city commission approval to begin construction of the allocated boat slip(s). If construction does not begin within three years, the right to develop the slips shall cease and the reserved slips shall be released and placed back into the excess slip pool. 
(3)  Extensions to slip reservation period. Reservation of boat slips may be extended for a period of one additional year by the administrative official or designee, providing the applicant demonstrates significant good faith efforts in moving toward construction permitting approval. The administrative official or designee will determine good faith effort based on the applicant's attempts to secure required permits. These attempts should be initiated at the commencement of the reservation period and evidence of continuous effort and progress throughout the three-year reservation period must be shown. 
E.  Exemptions.

City of Casselberry, 10 Fla. L. Weekly Supp. 408a, Per Curium Affirmed 2004 WL 1178246; (Fla. 5th DCA 2004); and matters and materials submitted at the public hearings relating to this Article and other matters and documents relating to all of the above; and the experiences of other central Florida communities, the commission hereby finds that: 
(A)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the City and other nearby cities or counties in central Florida where books, magazines, periodicals or other printed material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, videotapes, slides, computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or recordings, or recordings or other audio matter, or instruments, novelties, devices or paraphernalia which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specific sexual activities or specified anatomical areas are possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold. 
(B)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the City and other nearby cities or counties in central Florida where adult entertainment activities in the form of nude, seminude or topless dancers, entertainers, performers or other individuals who, for commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas; or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers. 
(C)  Commercial sexually oriented businesses exist or operate or may exist or operate within the City and other nearby cities or counties in central Florida where sexually oriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of commercial physical contact or escort services. The workers of such sexually oriented businesses operating in central Florida engage in physical contact or touching with customers, including acts of prostitution, or encourage or entice the customers to engage in lewdness. 
(D)  The activities described in subsections (A), (B) and (C) of this section occur at establishments which operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the City in the interest of the health, safety, economy, property values and general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the City. A major industry which is important to the community's economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to visit attractions who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere not dominated by commercialized sexual themes. 
(E)  When the activities described in subsections (A), (B) and (C) of this section are present in establishments, other activities which are illegal, unsafe or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons and property. 
(F)  When the activities described in subsections (A), (B) and (C) of this section are competitively exploited in establishments, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real-property values, promote the particular crimes described in subsection (E) of this section, and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(G)  The establishments in which the activities described in subsections (A), (B) and (C) of this section occur are often constructed, in part or in whole, of substandard materials, maintained in a manner reflecting disregard for the health and safety of the occupants, and have exterior signs or appearance that lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline. 
(H)  The activities described in subsections (A), (B) and (C) of this section often occur in establishments concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property, harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life, commerce and community environment. 
(I)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, property values and general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the City, it is necessary and advisable for the City to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages at establishments where the activities described in subsections (A), (B) and (C) of this section occur. 
(J)  Workers at adult entertainment establishments and sexually oriented businesses engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than workers of other establishments, including a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or engaging in lewdness in violation of F.S. ch. 796, operation without occupational licenses and illegal unlicensed massage. 
(K)  Physical contact or touching within establishments at which the activities described in subsections (A), (B) and (C) of this section occur between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
(L)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the City, it is necessary and advisable for the City to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, workers, entertainers, performers and customers at establishments where the activities described in subsections (A), (B) and (C) of this section occur. 
(M)  The potential dangers to the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the City posed by permitting an establishment at which the activities described in subsections (A), (B) and (C) of this section occur to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this Article are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate. 
(N)  Requiring operators of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this section occur to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects, and by making it difficult for minors to work in such establishments. 
(O)  Prohibiting establishments at which the activities described in subsections (A), (B) and (C) of this section occur from operating within set distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, residences, areas zoned or designated for residential use and parks, at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect minors from the adverse effects of the activities that accompany such establishments. 
(P)  Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances and enclosed adult booths in establishments at which the activities described in subsections (A), (B) and (C) of this section occur have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers, pose a threat to the health of the participants and promote the spread of communicable, sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression. 
(Q)  Physical contact or touching between workers of sexually oriented businesses and customers poses a threat to the health of both, and promotes the spread of communicable and sexually transmittable diseases. 
(R)  The practice of not paying workers at sexually oriented businesses and requiring them to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from their customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in an extremely high, nearly universal, incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers. 
(S)  Sexually oriented businesses involve activities the sole purpose of which is financial gain rather than free speech or expressive activity, and therefore are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health, welfare and safety of the community. 
(T)  Requiring sexually oriented businesses to post a listing of services provided, to restrict services to those listed and to maintain a customer contract and transaction record in a daily register will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution, thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur.

ARTICLE XII. - ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN STANDARDS 

1200.00. - Architectural design standards. 
    1200.01. City architectural design standards. 
    1200.01.1. Purpose and intent. It is the purpose of this section to provide general standards relating to the architectural design of development and redevelopment in the city. 
    1200.01.2. Applicability. These architectural standards shall apply to new development and redevelopment of multi-family, commercial, industrial, and PUD properties. Waivers may be granted to the applicable development provided that the structure(s) conform to the general standards contained herein. 
    1200.01.3. Enforceability. The planning director or designee shall act as the design reviewer for review of applications subject to the architectural standards. 
    1200.01.4. Submittals. The applicant shall submit, with the appropriate applications, elevation drawings and a site development plan or site improvement plan with enough detail to ensure that the intent of this section is met. 
    1200.01.5. Architectural standards. 
Facades and elevations: 
(1)  All primary facades of a building shall be designed with consistent architectural style, detail, and trim features. Facades attached to a primary facade shall incorporate features of the primary facade for a minimum of 33 percent of the overall wall length measured from the attached primary facade. In the case of outparcel buildings, all exterior facades shall adhere to the requirements of this section with respect to architectural design treatments for primary facades. 
(2)  Buildings or structures which are part of a present or future group or complex shall have a unity of character and design. The relationship of forms and the use, texture, and color of materials shall be such as to create a harmonious whole. When the area involved forms an integral part of, is immediately adjacent to, or otherwise clearly affects the future of any established section of the city, the design, scale, and location on-site shall enhance rather than detract from the character, value, and attractiveness of the surroundings. 
(3)  Buildings or structures located along strips of land or on single sites and not a part of a unified multi-building complex shall strive to achieve visual harmony with the surroundings. If the buildings are in undeveloped areas, three primary requirements must be met: proper design concepts, honest design construction, and appropriateness to surroundings. 
(4)  All facades visible to public or adjacent property shall be designed to create a harmonious whole. Materials shall express their function clearly and not appear as a material foreign to the rest of the building. 
(5)  It is not to be inferred that buildings must look alike to be of the same style or to be harmonious. Harmony can be achieved through the proper consideration of scale, proportions, site planning, materials, and color. 
(6)  Look-alike buildings are not allowed unless, in the opinion of the Design Reviewer, there is sufficient separation to preserve the aesthetic character of the present or evolving neighborhood. This is not to be construed to prohibit duplication of floor plans and exterior treatment in a planned development or developments which depend upon or are enhanced by the look-alike buildings and their relationship to each other. 
(7)  Buildings which are of symbolic design for reasons of advertising and buildings which are not compatible to the surroundings will not be approved. Symbols attached to buildings will not be allowed unless they are secondary in appearance to the building and landscape and are an aesthetic asset to the building project and neighborhood. 
(8)  Exterior lighting may be used to illuminate a building and its grounds for safety purposes but in an aesthetic manner. Lighting is not to be used as a form of advertising in a manner that is not compatible to the neighborhood or in a manner that draws considerably more attention to the building or grounds at night than in the day. Lighting following the form of the building or part of the building will not be allowed if the overall effect will be garish or detrimental to the environment. All fixtures used in exterior lighting are to be selected for functional and aesthetic value. 
(9)  All exterior forms, attached or not attached to buildings, shall be in conformity to and secondary to the building. They shall be an asset both to the aesthetics of the site and the neighborhood. 
(10)  The following architectural features shall be considered of primary importance when reviewing for consistency and are intended to be general in nature. They shall provide flexibility to the applicant in providing structure(s) which are in keeping with the architectural styles of the neighborhoods in which they are located: 
a.  Open air front or wrap around porches; 
b.  Gable, hipped, or mansard type roofs; 
c.  Second story balconies; 
d.  Decorative roof treatments, including but not limited to, pediments, dormers, ridge cresting, entablature, decorative bridgeboard, decorative shingles, etc. 
e.  Decorative window treatments, including but not limited to, louvered shutters, double-hung windows, arched windows, transoms, stained glass, etc. 
Building design: 
(1)  This section provides standards to maintain and enhance the attractiveness of the streetscape and the desired architectural design of the community. 
(2)  Buildings shall have architectural features and patterns that provide visual interest from the perspective of the pedestrian, reduce the massing aesthetic, recognize local character, and are site responsive. 
(3)  Facades shall be designed to reduce the mass/scale and uniform monolithic appearance of large unadorned walls, while providing visual interest that will be consistent with the community's identity and character, depending on the neighborhood, through the use of detail and scale. 
(4)  Articulation of buildings shall be accomplished by varying the buildings' mass in height and width so that they appear to be divided into distinct massing elements and details that can be perceived at the scale of the pedestrian (See Illustration 1). 

Illustration 1
(5)  Buildings and structures on corner lots at an intersection of two or more arterial or major collector roads shall be designed with additional architectural embellishments such as corner towers or other such design features, to emphasize their location as gateways and transition points within the community. 
(6)  Signage may not be located upon or within these additional architectural embellishments. 
Building orientation standards: Buildings with facades facing a public street shall have two of the following design features: 
a.  Windows comprising a minimum of 33 percent of the affected facade. 
b.  Projected covered public entry with a minimum of 20 percent of the wall space devoted to windows.

b.  Automobile sales parking lot awnings. Shade awnings may be erected in automobile sales parking lots subject to the following requirements and standards: 
1.  No shade awning structure shall be constructed within 75 feet of any public or private street. 
2.  No one shade awning structure may exceed an area sufficient to provide cover for more than 20 automobiles. The total width of all shade structures combined cannot exceed 50% of the parcel road frontage. 
3.  The minimum separation between shade awning structures shall be 100 feet. 
4.  Multi-colored shade awning structures are prohibited and the use of black, gray, florescent, primary and/or secondary colors is prohibited. Earth-tone colors are encouraged.

Illustration 3
Massing standards: Exterior facades shall be designed to employ the following design treatments: 
a.  No horizontal length or uninterrupted curve of any primary facade shall exceed 50 feet.

Awnings are included in this calculation at 1.5 times the window width when associated with windows/doors and are in increments of 10 feet in length or less. 
d.  All buildings shall provide a minimum of one offset per public street or navigable waterway. 
Exterior materials and exterior color standards. Exterior building materials contribute significantly to the visual impact of a building on the community. They shall be well-designed and integrated into a comprehensive design style for the project. 
a.  Predominant exterior building colors that are prohibited: 
1.  Florescent or day glow colors; 
2.  Corporate colors or colors used in the marketing of the business occupying the space which are not earth tone shall be calculated towards the allowable signage copy area provided for under section 604.12 of the land development regulations.

    As such, the City Commission appoints a City Manager ([see Charter] chapter 4, section 28). In accordance with the Charter, the City Manager is responsible to the City Commission for the proper administration of all affairs of the city. 
    To this end, the City Manager is to see that the laws and ordinances are enforced; appoint and remove all subordinate officers in accordance with the Charter; exercise control of all divisions of the municipal government in accordance with the Charter; to formulate recommendations to the City Commission; to participate in all discussions of the City Commission; to advise them concerning financial matters and such other powers and responsibilities as provided in chapter 4 of the Charter. 
    Department/division heads are appointed by the city to ensure that the laws, ordinances, policies and/or directives are enforced and to direct supervision of their departmental operation, as established by the Municipal Code, City Commission and/or City Manager. 
    In order to ensure that the operations are administered properly, that supervision is provided in a manner which affords continuity of direction and enforcement and to minimize confusion regarding the day to day operations of the city, the following organizational structure and chain of command has been established. 
City Commission 
City Manager 
Department/division head 
Midlevel supervisor (if applicable) 
First level supervisor (if applicable) 
Employee (non-supervisory) 
    Except as authorized otherwise, or in an emergency situation, the organizational chain of command should be followed in all matters regarding the operations of the city. 
    Appointed board members, except as otherwise provided by this code or law, do not have supervisory/directive authority over any municipal employees. Difficulties encountered by board members from employees of the city should be reported to the department head for proper corrective action; or in the case of a department head, to the City Manager. 
    As detailed in the Charter, the public policy legislative decisions of the city will be made by the City Commission, with the advice and recommendations of the City Manager. Under no circumstances are staff members, including department/division heads, to make policy recommendations to the City Commission without prior review by the City Manager. 
    Staff members are not to initiate communications regarding policy and/or procedures with the City Manager without advance approval of the department head, and city staff are not to initiate communications with the City Commission regarding policy and/or operations without advance approval by the City Manager. 
    Each employee has the right to appear before the City Commission; however, each employee must utilize the organizational chain-of-command prior to contacting the City Commission. This procedure is established to ensure that: 
1.  A resolution of the matter/concern can be secured at the administrative level, if possible. 
2.  The commission is provided a comprehensive and complete description and/or briefing. 
3.  The city and/or City Commission are not placed in a legally compromising situation.

1.  The staff member representing the city is to stay abreast and up-to-date of the policy direction of the city. This is to be accomplished through department head meetings and briefings with the City Manager. 
2.  When requested to provide the "city's position," the position provided by the staff representative should be clarified that the position is not official until the City Manager (operational/administrative issues) and/or the City Commission (policy/legislative issues) have taken an action to confirm. If either the manager/commission has already affirmed a position, the representative may so indicate. 
3.  When a staff representative is requested to vote on an issue, indicating a nonbinding position of the city, the representative should request direction from the City Manager prior to such vote, if possible. If such direction may not be obtained, the staff representative should utilize his/her professional judgment. 
4.  When a staff representative is requested to take an action that will bind the city, such actions should only be taken after the city has indicated a formal position. The City Manager's office should be routinely briefed on any and all committee/board matters in order to ensure consistent policy interpretation, to keep the City Commission briefed, to secure legal advice when necessary and to insure a uniform administrative process.

In addition to federal law requirements, The City of New Smyrna Beach complies with applicable state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the City has facilities. This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including recruiting, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation and training. 
The City of New Smyrna Beach expressly prohibits any forms of workplace harassment based on race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, nation of origin, age, genetic information, disability or veteran status. 
The City of New Smyrna Beach is committed to a work environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. Each individual has the right to work in a professional atmosphere that promotes equal employment opportunities and prohibits unlawful discriminatory practices, including harassment. Therefore, The City of New Smyrna Beach expects that all relationships among persons in the office will be business-like and free of bias, prejudice and harassment. 
It is the policy of The City of New Smyrna Beach to ensure equal employment opportunity without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity and sexual orientation), national origin, age, disability, genetic information or any other characteristic protected by law. The City of New Smyrna Beach prohibits any such discrimination or harassment. 
The City of New Smyrna Beach encourages reporting of all perceived incidents of discrimination or harassment. It is the policy of The City of New Smyrna Beach to promptly and thoroughly investigate such reports. The City of New Smyrna Beach prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports discrimination or harassment or who participates in an investigation of such reports. 
2.  Definitions of Harassment and Statement of Prohibited Conduct. Sexual harassment constitutes discrimination and is illegal under federal, state and local laws. For the purposes of this policy, sexual harassment is defined, as in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Guidelines, as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when, for example a) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment; b) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or c) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. 
Sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and not-so-subtle behaviors and may involve individuals of the same or different gender. Depending on the circumstances, these behaviors may include unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; sexual jokes and innuendo; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; commentary about an individual's body, sexual prowess or sexual deficiencies; leering, whistling or touching; insulting or obscene comments or gestures; display in the workplace of sexually suggestive objects or pictures; and other physical, verbal or visual conduct of a sexual nature. 
Also prohibited is preferential treatment or promise of preferential treatment to an employee for submitting to sexual conduct, including soliciting or attempting to solicit any employee to engage in sexual activity for compensation or reward; and 
Subjecting, or threats of subjecting, an employee to unwelcome sexual attention or conduct or intentionally making performance of the employee's job more difficult because of that employee's sex. 
Sexual or discriminatory displays or publications anywhere in the City of New Smyrna Beach workplace by employees is prohibited such as; displaying pictures, posters, calendars, graffiti, objects, promotional materials, reading materials, or other materials that are sexually suggestive, sexually demeaning, or pornographic, or bringing into the City of New Smyrna Beach work environment or possessing any such material to read, display or view at work. 
A picture will be presumed to be sexually suggestive if it depicts a person of either sex who is not fully clothed or in clothes that are not suited to or ordinarily accepted for the routine work in and around the City of New Smyrna Beach and who is posed for the obvious purpose of displaying or drawing attention to private portions of his or her body. Reading or otherwise publicizing in the work place materials that are in any way sexually revealing, sexually suggestive, sexually demeaning or pornographic is prohibited. 
Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly prohibited. Under this policy, harassment is verbal, written or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his/her race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, genetic information or any other characteristic protected by law or that of his/her relatives, friends or associates, and that a) has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment; b) has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance; or c) otherwise adversely affects an individual's employment opportunities. 
Harassing conduct includes epithets, slurs or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; and written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group and that is placed on walls or elsewhere on the employer's premises or circulated in the workplace, on city time or using city equipment via e-mail, phone (including voice messages), text messages, tweets, blogs, social networking sites or other means. 
3.  Individuals and Conduct Covered. These policies apply to all applicants and employees, whether related to conduct engaged in by fellow employees or someone not directly connected to The City of New Smyrna Beach (e.g., an outside vendor, consultant). 
Conduct prohibited by these policies is unacceptable in the workplace and in any work-related setting outside the workplace, such as during business trips, business meetings and business-related social events. 
4.  Complaint Process. Individuals who believe they have been the victims of conduct prohibited by this policy statement or who believe they have witnessed such conduct should discuss their concerns with their immediate supervisor, Human Resources or any member of management. 
When possible, The City of New Smyrna Beach encourages individuals who believe they are being subjected to such conduct to promptly advise the offender that his or her behavior is unwelcome and request that it be discontinued. Often this action alone will resolve the problem. The City of New Smyrna Beach recognizes, however, that an individual may prefer to pursue the matter through complaint procedures. 
The City of New Smyrna Beach encourages the prompt reporting of complaints or concerns so that rapid and constructive action can be taken before relationships become irreparably strained. Therefore, although no fixed reporting period has been established, early reporting and intervention have proven to be the most effective method of resolving actual or perceived incidents of harassment. 
Any reported allegations of harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be investigated promptly. The investigation may include individual interviews with the parties involved and, where necessary, with individuals who may have observed the alleged conduct or may have other relevant knowledge. 
Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the investigatory process to the extent consistent with adequate investigation and appropriate corrective action. 
Retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or discrimination or for participating in an investigation of a claim of harassment or discrimination is a serious violation of this policy and, like harassment or discrimination itself, will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge. Acts of retaliation should be reported immediately and will be promptly investigated and addressed. Misconduct constituting harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be dealt with appropriately. 
False and malicious complaints of harassment, discrimination or retaliation may be the subject of appropriate disciplinary action up to and including discharge. 
C. - Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA). 
    The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act, known as the ADAAA, are federal laws that prohibit employers with 15 or more employees from discriminating against applicants and individuals with disabilities and that when needed, provide reasonable accommodations to applicants and employees who are qualified for a job, with or without reasonable accommodations, so that they may perform the essential job duties of the position. 
    It is the policy of The City of New Smyrna Beach to comply with all federal and state laws concerning the employment of persons with disabilities and to act in accordance with regulations and guidance issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Furthermore, it is the City's policy to not discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities in regard to application procedures, hiring, advancement, discharge, compensation, training or other terms, conditions and privileges of employment. 
    The City of New Smyrna Beach will reasonably accommodate qualified individuals with a disability so that they can perform the essential functions of a job unless doing so causes a direct threat to these individuals or others in the workplace and the threat cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation and/or if the accommodation creates an undue hardship to The City of New Smyrna Beach. Contact the Human Resources department with any questions or requests for accommodation. 
D. - Code of ethics (Conflict of Interest). 
    To avoid misunderstandings and conflicts of interest that could arise, employees of the city will adhere to the following policy. This policy is in accordance with F.S. ch 112, entitled "Code of Ethics for Public Officers and Employees." 
1.  No public officer, employee of an agency, local government attorney, or candidate for nomination or election shall solicit or accept anything of value to the recipient, including a gift, loan, reward, promise of future employment, favor, or service, based upon any understanding that the vote, official action, or judgment of the public officer, employee, local government attorney, or candidate would be influenced thereby. 
2.  No public officer, employee of an agency, or local government attorney shall corruptly use or attempt to use his or her official position or any property or resource which may be within his or her trust, or perform his or her official duties, to secure a special privilege, benefit, or exemption for himself, herself, or others. This section shall not be construed to conflict with s. 104.31. 
3.  No city employee shall disclose confidential information gained by reason of their official position, nor shall they otherwise use such information for their personal gain or benefit. This is subject to the requirements of F.S. Chap. 119.07. 
4.  No officer or employee of the city shall have or hold any employment or contractual relationship with any business entity or any agency which is subject to the regulation of, or is doing business with, an agency of which he/she is an officer or employee; nor shall an officer or employee of an agency have or hold any employment or contractual relationship that will create a continuing or frequently recurring conflict between his/her private interests and the performance of his/her public duties or that would impede the full and faithful discharge of his/her public duties. 
5.  If an employee of the city is an officer, director, agent, or member of, or owns material interest in any corporation, firm partnership, or other business entity which is subject to the regulations of or which has substantial business commitments with the city, they shall file a sworn statement to this effect, with the circuit court of the county in which the employee is principally employed. 
6.  No city employee shall transact any business in their official capacity with any business entity of which he or she is an officer, director, agent or member, or in which he or she or their spouse or child owns a material interest. 
7.  No city employee shall have personal investments in any enterprise that will create a substantial conflict between their [city employee's] private interests and the public interest. 
8.  No city employee shall violate any provision of F.S. Chap. 112, as amended from time to time, and as more particularly set forth therein. 
Any violation of the provisions of this policy shall be subject to review and appropriate corrective action. 
When an employee of the city has any doubt as to the application of this policy, they [the employee] should discuss the possible violation with the department head or, where a department head is concerned, they should discuss the possible violation with the Director of Human Resources. 
E. - Political activity. 
1.  No employee, official, or other person shall solicit, orally or by letter, contributions or services for any political party or candidate from any employee during his/her hours of duty, service, or work with the city. 
2.  Nothing herein contained shall be construed to restrict the right of the employee to hold membership in and support a political party, to vote as he/she chooses, to express opinions on all political subjects and candidates, to maintain political neutrality, to attend political meetings after working hours, or to campaign actively during off-duty hours in all areas of political activity. 
3.  Any employee who is elected or appointed to any political office shall immediately notify the city. Any employee so elected or appointed may be required to resign his/her employment with the city, depending upon the position he/she is elected or appointed to as adopted by the City Commission. 
F. - Public relations, release of information. 
1.  The employee shall, at all times, be courteous and friendly to those members of the public who seek information. 
2.  Employees are cautioned that information concerning subjects under discussion or consideration often change in content and meaning before becoming an accomplished fact. Any release of such information before final decisions or disposition of the matter often causes misunderstanding and confusion resulting in a waste of time and money. 
3.  An employee will decline courteously to reveal information and shall direct such inquiry to the department head or City Manager, keeping in mind that it is not the intent of the city to be secretive; or to withhold valid information, but to assure that all information released is true and accurate. 
4.  From time to time, any city employee, especially those in supervisory and managerial positions, may be requested or subpoenaed to make a statement to an attorney or law firm regarding city business. These statements are generally concerned with an employee who may have suffered an accident and generally has contemplated action against the city. Should an employee receive either a request or subpoena, the matter will be discussed first with the department head, who in turn, will notify the City Manager. 
G. - Receipt of Legal Notices and Personal and Property Damage. 
    Legal notices/inquiries either in the form of subpoenas, court and agency complaints or written communication from attorneys/law offices should be forwarded immediately to the City's Attorney Office. No response should be made by any employee directly to such inquiry no matter how innocent the request may seem, i.e. providing copies of records or employee data, etc. Prompt contact with the attorney office is vital when the City receives legal notices/inquiries. The response time to such notices is usually short, sometimes 20 days or less, and the City and individual defendants risk having judgments made against them if responses are delayed. 
    Legal counsel will advise the City on the need for background information, the action they intend to take and in most cases will provide the actual response to the attorney. Procedures for receipt of legal notices/inquiries: 
1.  When legal notices are served in person by a processor, the server should be directed to the City Attorney's office. 
2.  When legal complaints are received by mail, the office receiving the notice should date stamp the papers, save the envelope and forward the documents received immediately to the City Attorney's Office. 
3.  The City Attorney's Office will provide the City Manager's office with copies of notices/inquires which relate to their area as indicated. 
H. - Solicitation and distribution. 
1.  City employees are prohibited from soliciting any other employees of the city, engaging in discussion or advocating a position on behalf of any organization, including any labor union, labor organization, or employee organization, during their working hours or the working hours of the employee sought to be solicited. The term working hours as used in this section shall not include lunch breaks or other recognized break time. 
2.  City employees are prohibited from distributing literature that tends to promote any organization including any labor union, labor organization, or employee organization, during working hours in any area where city work is performed. The distribution of literature shall not be prohibited during an employee's lunch hour, recognized breaks, or in such areas not specifically devoted to the performance of the employee's official duties. 
3.  Distribution of literature for city-sanctioned programs such as recreational activities, are not restricted by this rule. 
4.  Employee contributions to recognized charitable organizations are purely voluntary. No coercion of an employee to make contributions shall be permitted. 
I. - Employee debts. 
    An employee's financial transactions are the employee's personal affair. This city will not act as a collection agent for an employee, or for collection agencies. However, should complaints concerning an employee's failure to meet financial obligations result in interference with the employee's job performance or loss of time and effort on the part of the human resources office or other city employees, the employee concerned shall be so informed. Should the condition continue, the employee may be subject to appropriate corrective action. 
J. - Use of city property/vehicles and Seatbelt Policy. 
    An employee shall not use city property, equipment, or vehicles except in the performance of official duty, nor permit its use by an unauthorized person, either on-duty or off-duty except as otherwise approved by the City Commission and/or the City Manager. Any violation of the foregoing may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
    An employee driving a City vehicle must have on their person a valid driver's license issued by the State of Florida (Commercial Driver's License as mandated by law). Additionally, employees are required to notify the Human Resource Department, through their supervisor, of any change of status in their license. Suspension or revocation of licenses may affect the person's status of employment, depending on any job requirement for the employee to operate a City vehicle in the course of their job duties. 
    The cleanliness of the interior of the vehicle is the responsibility of the person to whom the vehicle is assigned. Each person who uses a vehicle is responsible for keeping it orderly and litter free. Smoking is not permitted in any City vehicles. This also includes products such as cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, snuff and chewing tobacco. 
    The safety and well-being of our employees is of critical importance. We therefore each have a responsibility to not only protect ourselves when on the road but also should do our part to protect those around us. Employees that are required to drive on city business at any time will be expected to follow all the procedures below. 
1.  All employees are required to wear seat belts at all time while in a moving vehicle being used for city business, whether they are the driver or a passenger. 
2.  Use of handheld cell phones (either talking or texting), whether personal or business-owned, while behind the wheel of a moving vehicle being used on city business is strictly prohibited. 
3.  Although use of cell phones under any circumstances is strongly discouraged while driving, the use of hands-free technology may be warranted in unusual or emergency circumstances. 
4.  Engaging in other distracting activities including, but not limited to, eating, reading, wearing of ear buds, etc. is prohibited while driving. 
5.  Use of drugs and/or alcohol or other substances, including certain over-the-counter cold or allergy medications that in any way impair driving ability, is prohibited. 
6.  All employees are expected to follow all driving laws and safety rules such as adherence to posted speed limits and directional signs, use of turn signals and avoidance of confrontational or offensive behavior while driving. Drivers must turn off and secure vehicles prior to exiting (except: police and fire units). 
7.  Employees should never allow anyone to ride in any part of the vehicle not specifically intended for passenger use and/or any seat that does not include a working seat belt. 
8.  Employees who drive commercial vehicles or who are otherwise subject to separate rules and regulations such as those dictated by state or federal law are also expected to adhere to all policies and regulations associated with the appropriate law or regulation that applies. 
9.  Employees must promptly report any accidents to Supervisors in accordance with established procedures. 
10.  Employees are also expected to report any moving or parking violations received while driving on city business and/or in city vehicles. 
11.  Failure to adhere to these procedures may result in disciplinary action per city policy. 
K. - Personal appearance/dress code. 
    As a representative of the City of New Smyrna Beach, you must present a neat and well-groomed appearance in accordance with the highest standards intended to insure that we continue our excellent reputation for serving members of our city. 
    Therefore, the following guidelines for personal appearance and grooming are established and apply to all employees: 
1.  Each employee shall present an overall appearance of being neat and well-groomed at all times while at work. The uniform, (when applicable) dress code or personal appearance of each particular job or department must be followed. An employee whose work or professional status requires wearing a uniform should do so with pride. 
2.  Personal hygiene measures shall be taken at all times. 
3.  A minimum amount of jewelry of a conservative nature may be worn, and then only by employees whose work permits. 
4.  Makeup and perfume or cologne may be worn in good taste. Excessive use shall be avoided if perfume or cologne causes allergic reactions. 
5.  Employees are encouraged to wear hair in a neat, clean and well-groomed manner (including facial hair). Hair shall be worn clean and well groomed. Extreme styles are unacceptable. 
6.  Clothing of non-uniformed employees shall be conservative in color, cut, fabric and considered Business Casual. 
L. - Drug and alcohol policy. 
1.  Purpose. As a part of its commitment to safeguard the health of its employees, to provide a safe and productive work environment, and to promote a drug-free community, the City of New Smyrna Beach has established this policy on the use of drugs and/or alcohol and abuse in the workplace. This policy is established pursuant to the drug-free workplace program under Florida's Workers' Compensation Law, F.S. § 440.101-102, F.A.C. chap. 38F-9; the Florida Uniform Traffic Control Law, F.S. § 316.302, the U.S. Department of Transportation Administration Controlled Substance Testing, 49 CFR part 382, U.S. Department of Transportation Drug Testing Procedures, 49 CFR part 40. 
The use of illegal drugs and/or alcohol abuse, while at work or otherwise, seriously endangers the safety of employees, as well as the general public, and creates a variety of workplace problems including increased injuries on the job, increased absenteeism, increased health care and benefit costs, increased theft, decreased morale, decreased productivity and a decline in the quality of products and services provided. The City of New Smyrna Beach has established this policy to prevent the possession or use of illegal drugs and/or alcohol at any time and to further prohibit the possession or use of drugs and/or alcohol during working time, on city property and in city vehicles. "Illegal drug" means any narcotic, barbiturate, marijuana, central nervous system stimulant, hallucinogen, cocaine or any controlled substance as defined by F.S. § 893.03, as amended from time to time, not possessed or used in accordance with a lawful prescription. 
The City of New Smyrna Beach implemented this policy pursuant to the drug-free workplace program under the Florida Workers' Compensation Act, F.S. § 440.101-102 and FAC 38F-9. This provides that an employee, who is injured in the course and scope of his employment and tests positive on a confirmed drug test, may forfeit his eligibility for medical and indemnity benefits under Florida's Workers' Compensation in addition to disciplinary action. Refusal to take a drug test will result in the employee forfeiting his eligibility for medical and indemnity benefits under Florida's Workers' Compensation and will be cause for termination of employment. 
This policy as it relates to applicants or employees who are required to have a commercial drivers' license, is implemented pursuant to the U.S. Department of Transportation (D.O.T.) Regulations, 49 CFR Part 40 and 49 CFR Part 352, et seq. and the Florida Uniform Traffic Control Law, F.S. § 316.302. Parts of this policy may only apply to employees covered by the D.O.T. regulations, or additional requirements may be applied in accordance with D.O.T. regulations. 
The purpose of this policy is to communicate the city's position on the use and/or possession of illegal drugs and/or alcohol, both in the workplace and in the community, and provide guidance for the implementation of related programs. 
2.  Scope. All employees are covered by this policy as more fully described in the policy and are required to abide by the terms of this policy as a condition of employment. 
3.  Drug-free workplace policy dissemination. 
a.  The employer will give a general one-time notice to all employees that it is a condition of employment to refrain from using, possessing or otherwise dealing in drugs and/or alcohol on or off the job and that a drug testing program is being implemented. 
b.  Sixty-days may elapse between the notice and the actual drug and/or alcohol testing. This 60-day notice of testing provision does not apply to employees who are, as of January 1, 1996, required to be tested pursuant to D.O.T. Drug and/or Alcohol Testing Rules or employees previously noticed and [who have] received any required training. 
c.  A notice of drug and/or alcohol testing will be included with all vacancy announcements for those positions where drug and/or alcohol testing is required as part of the employment process. A notice of the city's drug and/or alcohol testing policy will be available for inspection during regular business hours by the general public in the city's human resources office. 
4.  Definitions. The definitions of words and terms as set forth in the Florida Workers' Compensation Drug and/or Alcohol Testing Rules shall apply to the terms used in this policy. 
5.  Alcohol use prohibitions. 
a.  The consumption of alcohol on city premises, in a city vehicle, or while on duty is prohibited and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. There may be occasions, removed from the usual work setting, at which it is permissible to consume alcohol in moderation on city premises. 
b.  Off-duty abuse of alcohol that adversely affects an employee's job performance or adversely affects or threatens to adversely affect other interests of the city is prohibited and may result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge. 
c.  The personal possession (whether on the person, or in a desk, locker or city vehicle) of alcohol on city premises or on duty will result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge. 
d.  The possession of alcohol on city property in a personal vehicle in a closed container (i.e., the manufacturer's seal on the container has not been opened or broken) is not prohibited, provided such possession is in compliance with this policy as well as federal, state and local laws. 
e.  It is against city policy to report to work or to work under the influence of alcohol. 
f.  For the purpose of this policy, an employee is presumed to be under the influence of alcohol if a blood test or other scientifically acceptable testing procedure shows a forensically acceptable positive quantum of proof of alcohol usage. 
g.  Consistent with this policy, an employee who is perceived to be under the influence of alcohol will be removed immediately from the workplace and may be evaluated by medical personnel, if reasonably available. The city will take further action (i.e., removal from service, referral to counseling and/or disciplinary action) based on medical information, position held, work history, job conduct, and other relevant factors. The determination of what action is appropriate in each case rests solely with the city. 
h.  Refusal to submit to, efforts to tamper with, confirmed, positive results of an alcohol test will result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. 
Employees arrested for an alcohol-related incident shall immediately notify their division supervisor, the Director of Human Resources or their department head of the arrest. Failure to notify an appropriate city official may result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. 
6.  Drug use prohibitions. 
a.  The use, sale, purchase, possession, manufacture, distribution or dispensation of illegal drugs (to include possession of drug paraphernalia) at any time, whether on or off duty and whether on or off city property, is cause for immediate discharge. Any illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia will be turned over to an appropriate law enforcement agency and may result in criminal prosecution. 
b.  It is against city policy to report to work or work under the influence of drugs. This includes prescription drugs that induce an unsafe mental or physical state. Employees who violate this policy are subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge. 
c.  For the purpose of this policy, an employee is presumed to be under the influence of drugs if a urine test or other accepted testing procedure shows a forensically acceptable confirmed positive quantum of proof of drug usage. Test results will be confirmed by a second test different in scientific principle from the initial test. A confirmed positive drug test will result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge. 
d.  Prescription drugs may also affect the safety of the employee or fellow employees or members of the public. Therefore, any employee who is taking any prescription drug that might impair safety, performance, or any motor functions must advise his supervisor before reporting to work under such medication. A failure to do so may result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. If the city determines that such use does not pose a safety risk, the employee will be permitted to work. The city reserves the right to require that the employee have his/her physician confirm that the substance does not adversely affect the employee's ability to perform work in a safe manner. If such use impairs the employee's ability to safely and effectively perform work, the city may temporarily reassign the employee or grant a leave of absence during the period of treatment. Improper use of "prescription drugs" is prohibited and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Prescription medication must be kept in its original container if such medication is taken during working hours or on city premises. 
e.  Employees arrested for a drug related incident shall immediately notify their division supervisor, the Director of Human Resources or their department head of the arrest. Failure to notify an appropriate city official may result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. 
f.  Refusal to submit to or efforts to tamper with a drug test will result in discharge. 
7.  Testing. 
a.  Testing of applicants (illegal drugs only). 
1.  All applicants for positions deemed "safety sensitive or special risk" considered final candidates for a position, to the extent permitted by Florida law, will be tested for the presence of illegal drugs as a part of the application process. All applicants for positions requiring a commercial drivers' license will be tested for illegal drugs pursuant to federal law. 
a.  Any job applicant who refuses to submit to required drug testing, refuses to sign the consent form, fails to appear for testing, tampers with the test, or fails to pass the pre-employment drug test shall be ineligible for hire. 
b.  Reasonable suspicion testing (alcohol and illegal drugs). 
1.  Employees must submit to a drug and/or alcohol test if reasonable suspicion exists to indicate that their ability to perform work safely or effectively may be impaired. 
"Reasonable suspicion testing" means drug and/or alcohol testing based on a belief that an employee is using or has used drugs and/or alcohol in violation of the city's policy, on the basis of specific, contemporaneous, particularly observations concerning physical behavior or performance indicators of probable drug use, drawn from those facts in light of experience. Human Resources must be consulted before sending an employee for reasonable suspicion testing. Among other things, such facts and inferences may be based upon: 
a.  Observable phenomena while at work, such as direct observation of drug and or alcohol use or of the physical symptoms or manifestations of being under the influence of a drug and/or alcohol. 
b.  Abnormal conduct or erratic behavior while at work or a significant deterioration in work performance. 
c.  A report of drug and/or alcohol use, provided by a reliable and credible source. 
d.  Gross negligence or carelessness. 
e.  Disregard for safety, life, or well-being of any city employee, customer or the general public. 
f.  Reporting to or remaining at work in an apparently unfit condition. 
g.  Excessive tardiness or absenteeism. 
h.  Evidence that an individual has tampered with a drug and/or alcohol test during his employment with the city. 
i.  Any employee while at work or operating a city vehicle involved in an accident that results in loss of life or serious injury or the employee receiving a citation for a moving traffic violation arising from the accident will be tested. 
If the employee, another employee or a member of the public is injured to the extent that medical attention is required; or if there is significant property damage, the employee shall be tested if there is information that the employee caused or contributed to the accident while at work or while operating a city vehicle. In any of these instances, the investigation and subsequent testing shall take place within two (2) hours following the accident. 
j.  Evidence that an employee has used, possessed, sold, solicited, or transferred drugs. 
k.  Any other conduct indicative of the abuse of alcohol or the use of illegal drugs. 
2.  The reasonable suspicion conduct should be witnessed by a supervisor or city official, if feasible. The supervisor or city official making the observation must have received training in the identification of actions, appearance, or conduct that are indicative of the use of drugs and/or alcohol. If a supervisor believes a reasonable suspicion exists, the supervisor should report his or her findings and observations to the Director of Human Resources, department head, or the City Manager. Upon approval by the City Manager, Director of Human Resources or other designated officer of the city, the employee will be asked to submit to a drug and/or alcohol test and sign a form acknowledging his or her consent. Factors that substantiate cause to test should be documented by the supervisor on the Substance Abuse Investigation Report Form that must be done as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after the employee has been tested. A copy of this report shall be given to the employee upon request and the original documentation shall be kept by the employer. 
c.  Random testing. 
1.  Employees in "safety sensitive" or "special risk" positions shall be required to submit to drug and/or alcohol testing on a random basis to the extent permitted by law. Currently, employees required to hold a commercial driver's license as required by their job description will be required to submit to drug and/or alcohol testing on a random basis. 
In addition, those required to hold a commercial driver's license will also be subject to random drug and/or alcohol testing as required by federal law. The list of those job classifications to be "safety sensitive" or "special risk" will be periodically updated as needed. 
2.  Selection of employees for random testing shall be conducted through the use of a random number generator or other neutral, scientifically valid selection process in each grouping of employees. 
3.  Employees selected for random testing will be contacted on the day the test is scheduled to occur and notified of the time and place of the test. 
4.  Testing may be postponed only when an employee's supervisor and the City Manager agree that there is a compelling need for deferral (i.e., the employee is out on leave or is on travel). 
5.  An employee whose random drug and/or alcohol test is deferred will be subject to an unannounced test within 60 days. 
d.  Post-accident testing. All post-accident testing required by the department of transportation is covered by reasonable suspicion testing under [sub] section b. above. 
e.  Follow-up testing. Employees who have tested positive, or otherwise violated this policy, are subject to discipline up to and including discharge. If the employee, in the course of employment, enters an employee assistance program for drug and/or alcohol related problems or a drug and/or alcohol rehabilitation program, the employee will be required to submit to random drug and alcohol testing for two years after completion of the program, or for such additional period of time in excess of two years recommended by the program. 
f.  Return to duty testing. An employee who does not pass a drug and/or alcohol test cannot return to work unless: 
1.  The city, at its sole discretion, permits the employee to return to work. 
2.  The employee passes a drug and/or alcohol test administered under this rule. 
3.  The employee agrees to participate in and successfully complete any drug and/or alcohol evaluation, counseling or rehabilitation program required by the city. 
4.  The employee agrees to submit to periodic, unannounced drug and/or alcohol tests for a period of two years following completion of the required drug and/or alcohol evaluation, counseling or rehabilitation program, or for such additional period of time in excess of two years recommended by the program. 
Participation in a treatment program, be it either voluntary or pursuant to this section, will not excuse work rule violations or poor performance; and an employee may be disciplined or discharged for such offenses or failure to perform. If the employee either does not complete his/her rehabilitation program or tests positive after completing the rehabilitation program, he/she will be subject to immediate discharge from employment. 
g.  Additional testing. Additional testing may also be conducted as required by applicable state or federal laws, rules, or regulations or as deemed necessary by the city (e.g., D.O.T. Alcohol and Drug Test Rules). 
h.  Refusal to test. 
1.  Employees who refuse to submit to a drug and/or alcohol test may forfeit their eligibility for all workers' compensation medical and indemnity benefits. 
2.  Any employee required to be tested under this policy who refuses to be tested; who refuses to sign required forms; who refuses to provide the necessary urine specimen or breath alcohol sample; who consumes alcoholic beverages within eight hours of any vehicle or work-related accident as described in [sub] section VII (B) (1) (i); or who engages in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge. 
8.  Testing procedure. 
a.  Test. Consistent with the testing provisions of [sub] section VII, the city may test for any or all of the following drugs and/or alcohol which is included but not limited to:

Hallucinogens 
Cannabinoids 
Cocaine 
Methadone 
Phencyclidine (PCP) 
Opiates 
Synthetic Narcotics 
Designer Drugs; 
or a metabolite of any of the substances listed herein. 
b.  Signing of form required. Job applicants and employees required to submit to drug testing will be required to sign an Applicant Drug Testing Consent Form or a Consent to Employee Testing Form. 
c.  Accurate testing program. Because of the potential adverse consequences of positive test results on employees, the city will employ a very accurate testing program. Urine, breath and, where used, blood samples will be analyzed by a qualified independent laboratory which has been selected by the city and approved by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (NIDA) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA). 
d.  Information relevant to test. At the sample collection site, applicants and, to the extent conditions permit, employees will be given an opportunity prior to testing to provide any information they consider relevant to the test, including listing all drugs they have taken recently, specifically listing prescribed drugs and explaining the circumstances of the use of those drugs in writing or providing other relevant medical information on a Drug Testing/Chain of Custody Form. The only time conditions which may require that the testing proceed without the opportunity described above is when the physical or mental condition of the employee would not allow the employee to provide meaningful information. In such circumstances, the employee will be given the opportunity to provide relevant information when practical, but prior to the test results being discussed with the city or the employee. This medical information is confidential and should be given only to the MRO [medical review officer]. The job applicants or employees will also be provided with a notice of the most common medications by brand name or common name, as well as the chemical name which may alter or affect a drug test. A list of common medications which may affect drug and/or alcohol test is as follows: 
The following list contains the most common drugs/medications by brand name, common name, or chemical name which may alter or affect the outcome of a drug test.

e.  Injured employee. An employee injured at the workplace and required to be tested shall be taken to a medical facility for immediate treatment of injury. If the injured employee is not at a designated collection site, the employee shall be transported to one as soon as it is medically feasible and specimens shall be obtained. If, as a result of medical treatment, blood is drawn, CDL holders who would normally be tested by breath may, at the option of the treating facility or the MRO, have their blood tested for drugs and/or alcohol. If it is not medically feasible to move the injured employee, specimens will be obtained at the treating facility under the procedures set forth in this policy and transported to an approved testing laboratory. 
f.  Emergency medical care. No specimens will be taken prior to the administration of emergency medical care. Once this condition has been satisfied, an injured employee must release to the employer the result of any tests conducted for the purpose of showing the presence of drugs and/ or alcohol. 
g.  Body specimens. Urine will be used for the initial test for all drugs and/or alcohol and for the confirmation of all drugs and/or alcohol. The physician shall have the discretion to determine whether drawing a blood sample will threaten the health of an injured employee or if the employee has a medical condition unrelated to the accident which may preclude the drawing of the necessary quantity of blood for a testing specimen. Under these circumstances, no inference or presumption of intoxication or impairment will be made. Alcohol tests for those holding a commercial driver's license will be tested by breath analysis, except as provided in [sub] section VIII e) above. 
h.  Cost of testing. The city shall pay the cost of initial and confirmation drug and/or alcohol tests, which it requires of employees and job applicants. An employee or job applicant shall pay the cost of any additional drug and/or alcohol tests not required by the city. 
i.  Collection site. The city will utilize a collection site designated by an approved laboratory which has all necessary personnel, materials, equipment, facilities, and supervision to provide for the collections, security, chain of custody procedures, temporary storage and shipping or transportation of urine and blood specimens to an approved drug and/or alcohol testing laboratory. The city may also utilize a medical facility as a collection site that meets the applicable requirements. 
Security of the collection site, chain of custody procedures, privacy of the individual, collection control, integrity and identity of the specimen and transportation of the specimen to the laboratory will meet state rules and guidelines. If the laboratory is certified by Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, Drug Testing/Chain-of-Custody/HRS Form 1806, or the currently applicable form, if any, will be used for each employee or job applicant tested. If the laboratory is certified by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, it will use the chain-of-custody form designated by the department of Health and Human Services; or the U.S. Department of Transportation Drug Testing Custody and Control form will be used for each employee or applicant tested. 
j.  Collection site personnel. A specimen in an amount sufficient for two drug and/or alcohol tests will be taken or collected by: 
1.  A physician, a physician's assistant, a registered professional nurse, a licensed practical nurse, a nurse practitioner, or a certified paramedic who is present at the scene of the accident for the purpose of rendering emergency service or treatment; or 
2.  A qualified person employed by a licensed laboratory who has the necessary training and skills for the assigned tasks. 
k.  Testing laboratory. The laboratory used to analyze initial or confirmation drug and/or alcohol specimens will be either licensed and approved by the Agency for Health Care Administration using criteria established by the Agency in its Drug-Free Workplace Standards (F.A.C. chap. 10E-18), or the laboratory will be certified by the United States Department of Health and Human Services using criteria established by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
When testing under the U.S. Department of Transportation regulations, the laboratory will follow the requirements and D.O.T. Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing programs (49 CFR, Part 40). 
1.  All laboratory security, chain of custody, transporting and receiving of specimens, specimen processing, retesting, storage of specimens, instrument calibration and reporting of results shall be in accordance with state laws and rules established by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
2.  The laboratory will provide assistance to the MRO, employee or job applicant for the purpose of interpreting any positive confirmed test results. 
9.  Initial tests. Initial drug tests shall use an immunoassay. Initial alcohol tests will be by breath analysis for D.O.T. purposes and by blood under the Florida Drug-Free Workplace Law. 
a.  Confirmation tests. All urine specimens identified as positive on the initial test shall be confirmed using Gas Chromatography/MASS Spectrometry (GC/MS). Initial positive blood alcohol tests will be confirmed by gas chromatography. Confirmation of breath alcohol analysis for commercial drivers' license holders under D.O.T. regulations will be by the same method as the initial test. All confirmation shall be done by quantitative analysis. Concentrations that exceed the linear region of the standard curve shall be documented in the laboratory and recorded as "greater than highest standard curve value." The following confirmation cutoff levels shall be used when analyzing specimens to determine whether they are positive or negative for these drug metabolites. 
10.  Test results. 
a.  Reporting results. 
1.  The laboratory will report test results (both positive and negative) to the medical review officer (MRO) within seven working days after receipt of the specimen by the laboratory. The name and address of the current medical review officer is on file with the collection site. The medical review officer (MRO) is contracted/employed by a third party vendor and not the drug-testing laboratory. 
2.  The laboratory will report as negative all specimens that are negative on the initial test or negative on the confirmation test. Only specimens confirmed positive on the confirmation test will be reported positive for a specific drug. A report will not disclose the presence or absence of any drug other than a specified drug and its metabolites listed in this policy. 
3.  The laboratory will transmit results in a manner designed to ensure confidentiality of the information. The laboratory and MRO will ensure the security of the data transmission and restrict access to any data transmission, storage and retrieval system. 
4.  The MRO will verify that positive and negative test results were properly analyzed and handled according to Agency for Health Care Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation or U.S. Department of Health and Human Services rules. The MRO will have knowledge of substance abuse disorders and shall also be knowledgeable in the medical use of prescription drugs and in the pharmacology and toxicology of illicit drugs. The MRO shall evaluate the drug test result(s), which is reported to by the lab, verify by checking the chain-of-custody form that the specimen was collected, transported and analyzed under proper procedures, and determine if any alternative medical explanations caused a positive test result. 
This determination by the MRO can include conducting a medical interview with the individual, review of the individual's medical history or the review of any other relevant biomedical factors. The MRO shall also review all medical records made available by the tested individual. The MRO may request the laboratory to provide quantization of test results. 
5.  The MRO will contact the employee or job applicant of a confirmed positive test result and inquire as to whether prescriptive or over-the-counter medications could have caused the positive test result. The MRO will follow the procedures set forth in the Florida Workers' Compensation Drug Testing Rules and the Agency for Health Care Administration, Drug-Free Workplace Standards or the rules established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or the U.S. Department of Transportation for providing the applicant or employee the opportunity to present relevant information regarding the test results. After following the appropriate procedures, the MRO will notify the city of any verified, confirmed positive test results. 
6.  Within five working days after receipt of a positive confirmed test result, the city will inform the employee or job applicant in writing of such positive test results, the consequences of such results, and the options available to the employee or job applicant, including the opportunity to contact the MRO and the right to file an administrative or legal challenge. 
7.  The city shall provide to the employee or job applicant, upon request, a copy of the test results. 
8.  Unless otherwise instructed by the city in writing, all records pertaining to a given specimen shall be retained by the drug-testing laboratory for a minimum of five years. The drug testing laboratory shall retain (in properly secured refrigerated or frozen storage) for a minimum period of one year, all confirmed positive specimens. Within this one-year period the city, employee, job applicant, MRO or the department of Health and Human Services may request in writing that the laboratory retain the specimen for an additional period of time. If no such request is received, the laboratory may discard the specimen after one year of storage. 
9.  Within 24 hours for all tests based on reasonable suspicion, the city will detail in writing the circumstances that formed the basis of the determination that a reasonable suspicion existed to warrant the testing. A copy of the report will be given to the employee upon request. The original report will be kept confidential and retained by the city for at least one year. 
b.  Reporting results. 
1.  Within five working days after receiving notice of a positive confirmed test result, the employee or job applicant may submit information to the MRO explaining or contesting the test results, or to the city explaining why the result does not constitute a violation of this policy. 
The employee or job applicant will be notified in writing if the explanation or challenge is unsatisfactory to the city. The written notice will be given to the employee or job applicant within 15 days of receipt of the explanation or challenge, and will include why the employee's or job applicant's explanation is unsatisfactory, along with the report of positive results. All such documentation will be kept confidential and will be retained for at least one year. 
2.  If the employee or job applicant does not submit to the city or MRO information explaining or contesting the test results within five days after receipt of notice of a positive test result, then the positive test result will become final for purposes of any employment or disciplinary action. 
c.  Employee protection. 
1.  During the 180-day period after written notification of a positive test result, the employee will be permitted by the employer to have a portion of the specimen retested, at the employee's expense. Any additional tests, however, must be conducted on the same specimen as the original test. The retesting must be done at a Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (HCA) or U.S. Department of Health and Human Services licensed and approved laboratory. The second laboratory must test at equal or greater sensitivity for the drug and/or alcohol in question as did the first laboratory. The first laboratory that performed the test for the employer shall be responsible for the transfer of the portion of the specimen to be retested, and for the integrity of the custody for such transfer. 
2.  The drug and/or alcohol testing laboratory will not disclose any information concerning the health or mental condition of the tested employee. 
3.  The city will not request or receive, from the testing facility, any information concerning the personal health, habit or condition of the tested employee including, but not limited to, the presence or absence of HIV antibodies in the tested worker's body fluids. 
4.  The city will not discharge, discipline, refuse to hire, discriminate against, or request or require rehabilitation of an employee or job applicant on the sole basis of a positive test result that has not been verified by a confirmation test and by a medical review officer (MRO). 
5.  The city will not discharge, discipline or discriminate against an employee, solely upon the employee's voluntarily seeking treatment, while under the employ of the city, for a drug and/or alcohol related problem, if the employee has not previously tested positive for drug and/or alcohol use, entered an employee assistance program (EAP) for drug and/or alcohol related problems, is not currently under investigation of an alleged violation of this policy, or entered an alcohol and drug rehabilitation program. The city retains the right to select an EAP or drug and/or alcohol rehabilitation program when the city pays the cost of the employee's participation in the program. 
6.  The carrier or self-insurer will pay all authorized treatment of an injured employee prior to reasonable notice of denial of benefits to the health care provider. Prior to denying medical and indemnity benefits based upon a confirmed positive test result, the employer's workers' compensation carrier or self-insurer will give reasonable notice to all affected health care providers that payment for treatment, care and attendance provided to the employee after a future date certain will be denied. 
11.  Disciplinary action. 
a.  In the case of a first-time violation of the city's policy, including a positive drug and/or alcohol test result (without evidence of use, sale, possession, distribution, dispensation, or purchase of drugs and/or alcohol on city premises or while on duty), the employee will be subject to discipline up to an including discharge. 
b.  The city may suspend employees with or without pay under this policy pending the results of a drug and/or alcohol test or investigation. 
c.  Any employee using, selling, purchasing, possessing, distributing or dispensing drugs and/or alcohol on duty or on city premises will be discharged. 
d.  The city reserves the right to discipline, up to and including termination, any employee who uses, possesses, sells, distributes, dispenses or purchases illegal drugs and/or alcohol, whether on or off duty or on or off city premises. 
12.  Investigation. 
a.  To ensure that illegal drugs and/or alcohol do not enter or affect the workplace, the city reserves the right, upon reasonable suspicion, to search all vehicles, containers, lockers or other items on city premises or in city vehicles in furtherance of this policy. Individuals may be requested to display personal property for visual inspection upon the city's request. 
b.  Searches will be conducted only where the city has reason to believe that the employee has violated the city's substance abuse policy. 
c.  Failure to consent to a search or display personal property for visual inspection will be grounds for discharge or denial of access to city premises. 
d.  Searches of an employee's personal property will take place only in the employee's presence. All searches under this policy will occur with the utmost discretion and consideration for the employee involved. 
e.  As part of the search policy referenced in [sub] section 10(a) above, individuals may be required to empty their pockets, and the city may use law enforcement personnel to conduct additional searches based upon reasonable suspicion. 
f.  Because the primary concern is the safety of its employees and their working environment, the city will not normally prosecute in matters involving illegal substances. However, the city will turn over all confiscated drugs and/or alcohol to the proper law enforcement authorities. Further, the city reserves the right to cooperate with or enlist the services of proper law enforcement authorities in the course of any investigation. 
13.  Arrest or conviction for drug-related crime. 
a.  If an employee is arrested for or convicted of a drug-related crime, the city will investigate all of the circumstances, and city officials may utilize the drug testing procedure if cause is established by the investigation. In most cases, an arrest for a drug-related crime constitutes reasonable suspicion of drug use under this policy. The following procedures will apply: 
1.  During investigation, an employee may be placed on leave without pay where the presence of the Employee at work constitutes a hazard or creates potential liability, either to the City, to other Employees, or to the Employee. After the investigation is completed, the leave may be converted to a suspension or the employee may be reinstated, depending upon the facts and circumstances. 
2.  If convicted of a drug-related crime, enters a plea of "nolo contendere" or enters into a "pretrial intervention agreement," or pleads guilty with adjudication withheld, the employee will be terminated. 
3.  If an employee has been suspended and the case has been dismissed or otherwise disposed of, the city will make a determination as to whether to authorize the employee's return to work based on its investigation. If the employee is authorized to return to work, the employee must agree in writing to unannounced, periodic testing for a period of up to two years. 
4.  Because of the seriousness of such situations, the city reserves the right to alter or change its policy or decisions on a given situation depending upon its investigation and the totality of the circumstances. 
b.  It is a condition of employment with the City of New Smyrna Beach that any employee who pleads guilty of or is convicted of any criminal drug violation occurring in the workplace or off the job must report such conviction to his supervisor within five calendar days of such conviction. A "nolo contendere" plea or enters a "pretrial intervention agreement" for drug activity is also to be reported in the same manner. Employees who are convicted of any criminal drug violation, who plead guilty with adjudication withheld, or who enter a "nolo contendere" plea may be disciplined or terminated. 
14.  Confidentiality. All information, interviews, reports, statement memoranda and drug and/or alcohol test results, written or otherwise, received by the city as a part of this drug and/or alcohol testing program are confidential communications. Unless authorized by state laws, rules or regulations, the city will not release such information without a written consent form signed voluntarily by the person tested. The right to confidentiality does not apply when the information is used by the city as a defense in a civil or administrative matter. 
15.  Records and training. 
a.  Resource file. The city will maintain a current resource file of providers of employee assistance including alcohol and drug abuse programs, mental health providers, and various other persons, entities or organizations designed to assist employees with personal or behavioral problems. The city will inform employees and new hires about various employee assistance programs that may be available. The information shall be made available at a reasonable time convenient to the city and shall be discretely reviewed by the employee. 
b.  Education course. The city will provide an annual education course to assist the employees in identifying personal and emotional problems that may result in the misuse of drugs and/or alcohol. This course will also include a presentation on the legal, social, physical and emotional consequences of the misuse of drugs and/or alcohol. 
c.  Individual test results. 
1.  The MRO shall be the sole custodian of individual test results. 
2.  The MRO shall retain the reports of individual test results for a period of at least five years. 
3.  Only the following information will be maintained by the city in an employee's confidential medical file: 
a.  The types of controlled substances testing for which the employee submitted a urine or blood specimen; 
b.  The date of such collection; 
c.  The location of such collection; 
d.  The identification of the person or entity (1) performing the collection, (2) analyzing the specimens, and (3) serving as the MRO; and 
e.  Whether the test finding was positive or negative and, if positive, the controlled substances identified in any positive test. 
4.  The city shall ensure that all records related to the administration and results of the drug-testing program are maintained for a period of five years. 
d.  Annual statistics for employees with commercial driver's licenses. The city will maintain an annual (calendar year) summary of the following records related to the administration and results of the controlled substance testing program for employees with commercial drivers' licenses: 
1.  The total number of controlled substance tests administered. 
2.  The number of controlled substance tests administered in each category (i.e., pre-employment, periodic, reasonable cause, and random). 
3.  The total number of individuals who did not pass a controlled substance test. 
4.  The total number of individuals who did not pass a controlled substance test by testing category. 
5.  The disposition of each individual who did not pass a controlled substance test. 
6.  The number of controlled substance tests performed by a laboratory that indicated evidence of a prohibited controlled substance or metabolite in the screening test in a sufficient quantity to warrant a confirmatory test. 
7.  The number of controlled substance tests performed by a laboratory that indicated evidence of a prohibited controlled substance or metabolite in the confirmatory test in a sufficient quantity to be reported as a "positive" finding to the MRO. 
8.  The number of controlled substance tests that were performed by a laboratory that indicated evidence of a prohibited controlled substance or metabolite in the confirmatory test in a sufficient quantity to be reported as a "positive" finding by substance category. 
e.  Commercial driver's license drug training program. 
1.  The city shall establish and maintain a drug and/or alcohol training program. The program shall, at a minimum, include the following:

3.  The drug and/or alcohol training program for all covered employees and supervisory personnel will consist of at least 60 minutes of training each year. Additionally, supervisors and managers over commercial drivers' license holders will receive an additional 60 minutes of alcohol and drug training each year. 
16.  Conclusion. The city's drug-free workplace policy has been prepared so as not to conflict with the public policy and, further, not to be discriminatory or abusive. A drug-free workplace should be the goal of every employer in America. 
Drug  testing is only one of the several steps that must be taken to achieve this objective. When incorporated into a comprehensive anti-drug effort, testing can go a long way in combating drug abuse in the workplace. 
This  policy supersedes any information provided to applicants and/or employees, either written or oral. The city reserves the right to change the provisions of this policy and testing program at any time in the future to remain in compliance with any state or federal law. 

M. - Smoke-Free Workplace. 
    The City of New Smyrna Beach is continually striving to improve the working conditions and protect the health of its employees and the general public. In accordance with the "Florida Clean Indoor Act", F.S. 386, the City will provide a healthy, comfortable and safe environment in all respects by prohibiting smoking and the use of all smoking and tobacco products (including e-cigarettes) in all City owned buildings, all city owned vehicles/equipment and while performing the functions of your job description. 
    The smoke-free workplace policy applies to: 
 All areas of city buildings. 
 All vehicles/equipment owned or leased by the City. 
 All visitors to city buildings. 
 All employees, temporary employees, interns and volunteers. 
    Any supervisor who observes an employee in violation of this rule will remind the employee of the rule and its intent. Violations will subject the employee to disciplinary action up to and including discharge. 
N. - Employee organizations. 
    The city's policy is an open door policy under which all employees have the right to deal directly with their supervisor or manager with reference to all working conditions. The city recognizes and accepts its obligation to provide the city employees with good working conditions, good wages and benefits, fair treatment, and personal respect which each employee deserves. 
    The city does not and will not discriminate against any employee because of his/her membership or non-membership in any organization. However, it is not necessary for city employees to belong to a union or any other organization in order to hold a job with the city. 
O. - Records and reports. 
1.  Responsibility. The Director of Human Resources is responsible for establishing and maintaining comprehensive central personnel records of all city employees. 
2.  Annual Report. The Director of Human Resources shall submit information to be included in the City Manager's Annual Report. 
3.  Records. 
a.  All personnel records of employees of the city and all other records and material relating to the administration of the city's personnel system shall be considered confidential and the property of the city to the extent permitted by law. The decision of the City Manager relating to the use, maintenance, and disposition of such records and material, and as to whether or not any information contained therein may be disclosed in accordance with applicable law shall be final. 
b.  Employees should be aware of the importance of keeping their personnel records current. This means immediately notifying the human resources office of any changes; such as, change of address (even if temporary), change of telephone number, change of beneficiary, number of dependents, divorce, marriage, or any change not previously reported, of status that was originally given at time of employment. This is the responsibility of the employee and failure to comply may result in loss of employee benefits or other corrective action. 
c.  The human resources office should be informed of any special training courses completed by an employee. Copies of diplomas or certificates will be forwarded to become a permanent addition to the employee's personnel file. 
4.  Records retention and disposition. The Director of Human Resources shall determine the time limit that any personnel records shall be kept on file and the final disposition of such records, in accordance with applicable laws. 
P. - Criminal history record checks for certain employees and appointees. 
    That pursuant to F.S. § 166.0442, a criminal history record check shall be required for any position of municipal employment or appointment which is critical to security or public safety, or for any private contractor, employee of a private contractor, vendor, repair person, or delivery person who has access to any public facility or publicly operated facility which is critical to security or public safety. The city shall require that each person applying for, or continuing employment in, any such position or having access to any such facility to be fingerprinted. The information obtained from the criminal history record checks conducted pursuant to this section may be used by the city to determine an applicant's eligibility for employment or appointment and to determine an employee's eligibility for continued employment. This section is not intended to preempt or prevent any other background screening, including, but not limited to, criminal history background checks, which the city may lawfully undertake. To the extent that the provisions of this section are inconsistent with any labor, or employment, or any other contract in existence at the adoption date of this section, the provisions of the contract shall control over the provisions of this section. All contracts adopted after the effective date of this section shall be consistent with the provisions of this section. 
    An employee is responsible for immediately notifying his/her Department Head when information or other charging documents has been filed by a prosecuting official against him/her for an offense or violation of law, or when indicted by a Grand Jury. Failure to do so shall result in disciplinary action. 
Q. - Workplace Bullying. 
    The City of New Smyrna Beach defines bullying as "repeated inappropriate behavior, either direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at the place of work and/or in the course of employment." Such behavior violates the city Code of Ethics, which clearly states that all employees will be treated with dignity and respect. 
    The purpose of this policy is to communicate to all employees, including supervisors, managers and executives, that the city will not tolerate bullying behavior. Employees found in violation of this policy will be disciplined up to and including termination. Bullying may be intentional or unintentional. However, it must be noted that where an allegation of bullying is made, the intention of the alleged bully is irrelevant and will not be given consideration when meting out discipline. As in sexual harassment, it is the effect of the behavior upon the individual that is important. The City of New Smyrna Beach considers the following types of behavior examples of bullying: 
    Verbal bullying: Slandering, ridiculing or maligning a person or his/her family; persistent name calling that is hurtful, insulting or humiliating; using a person as the butt of jokes; abusive and offensive remarks. 
    Physical bullying: Pushing, shoving, kicking, poking, tripping, assault or threat of physical assault; damage to a person's work area or property. 
    Gesture bullying: Nonverbal threatening gestures or glances that convey threatening messages. 
    Exclusion: Socially or physically excluding or disregarding a person in work-related activities. 
R. - Workplace Violence Policy. 
    The purpose of this policy is preventive, not punitive. It is the responsibility of each employee to contribute to a safe working environment. The City of New Smyrna Beach will do its part to prevent violence in the workplace and expects each employee's full cooperation. 
    It is the City of New Smyrna Beach's policy to provide a safe workplace for its employees. Due to the increased incidence of violent activities in workplaces, the City of New Smyrna Beach has adopted a zero-tolerance policy with respect to threats of violence or violent acts in the workplace. To further augment this policy, the following policy statement shall be adhered to by all City employees and contractors: 
    With the exception of weapons issued to public safety personnel or as otherwise permitted by Florida Statutes, including but not limited to F.S. § 790.251. F.S. § 790.251 referred to as the "Preservation and Protection of the Right to Keep and Bear Arms in Motor Vehicles Act of 2008". Employees are permitted to exercise their constitutional right to keep and bear arms or for exercising the right of self-defense as long as a firearm is never exhibited on city property for any reason other than lawful defensive purposes. The firearm must be locked and out of sight within the employees private motor vehicle. Any violation of the statute will result in discipline up to and including discharge. 
1.  Zero Tolerance. Threats, threatening language, or any other acts of aggression or violence made toward or by a City employee WILL NOT BE TOLERATED! For purposes of this policy, threat includes any verbal or physical harassment, an attempt at intimidation or to instill fear in others, menacing gestures, flashing of concealed weapons, stalking, verbal or physical abuse, or other hostile, aggressive, injurious, and destructive actions undertaken for the purpose of domination or intimidation. 
In addition, failure to comply with this policy will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. 
2.  Responsibilities. All potentially dangerous situations, including threats, should be reported immediately to one's supervisor or Director of Human Resources. The key to preventing violence is to report the threat. All threats will be promptly investigated. Reports of threats may be made anonymously. No employee will be subject to retaliation, intimidation, or discipline as a result of reporting a threat under this policy, unless the report of the threat is found to be deliberately false. If an investigation confirms that an employee commits the violence or threat, the City will take appropriate corrective action that may, at the discretion of the City Manager, include discharge of the offender. Disciplinary action up to and including discharge may also be taken against anyone who knowingly makes a false, meritless or malicious claim under this policy. The Human Resources Department will appoint employees to the Threat Assessment Team. 
It is also important to report the following: 
 Suspicious acts inside the building. 
 A suspicious vehicle outside the building. 
 Threats made by irate customers. 
 Threats made by spouses and/or ex-spouses. 
 Acts of stalking. 
 Unusual packages or letters. 
3.  Inspections. If there is reasonable suspicion to believe that personal property may contain weapons not authorized, the City has the right to inspect personal property of employees on City property. 
An employee who refuses, when a reasonable suspicion exists, to submit immediately to such an inspection of his or her person, vehicle or other property shall be considered insubordinate and subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. 
Any weapon discovered to be in violation of the City's policy may be seized by the City and may be turned over to law-enforcement authorities. 
Weapons are defined as: 
a.  Any firearm. 
b.  Any item that is specifically designed or used to intentionally inflict bodily harm. 
c.  Any item which is inappropriate in the employee's workplace and which may be used to cause fear of violence or may be used in connection with threats. 
4.  Procedures For Handling Violent Situations. 
a.  Pre-Crisis Situations: When an employee identifies a potentially violent situation: 
1.  The employee reports the situation to his or her supervisor or the Director of Human Resources. 
2.  Management investigates the situation. 
3.  Based on the results of the investigation, management either: 
a.  Resolves the situation utilizing existing procedures (e.g., counseling, discipline, EAP, or other resource). 
b.  Activates a Threat Assessment Team comprised of the Safety Officer and supervisory personnel. 
c.  Informs the City Manager of the potential crisis. 
4.  Management will follow up with the complainant. 
b.  Crisis Situations. 
1.  Personal safety must be the utmost priority. 
2.  Management contacts local law-enforcement and/or medical-emergency personnel.

S. - Conclusion. 
    The City's objective is to maintain the safety of all of its employees. Therefore, no employee shall engage in any conduct that would serve to escalate a hostile or threatening situation. 
    Nothing in the Violence in the Workplace Policy or guidelines is intended or shall be used to violate any legal requirement or safety standard. If applicable laws or safety standards become effective which are in conflict with any provisions of the Policy or Guidelines, the Policy and /or Guidelines shall be deemed amended to conform to such conflicting provisions and all other provisions shall remain in effect.

The requesting department may resubmit the Position Authorization Request form if the position is deemed necessary and is approved by the City Manager to be filled. 
6.  Filling positions. The city follows the procedure commonly known as "rule of three" in processing applicants to fill vacant positions. Each department head shall have a minimum of three applicants to review for each position, including internal promotions. This provision may be waived by the department head and Director of Human Resources, when factors exist which would delay the timely filling of a vacancy or warrant an expedited placement procedure.

C. - Use of Social Security Number. 
    The Florida Legislature adopted requirements relating to the collection and dissemination of social security numbers by all "agencies" in Florida. The City of New Smyrna Beach is defined as an "agency" under F.S. § 119.071. 
1.  Applicability. The provisions of this policy apply to all City employees, officers, departments, divisions, boards, commissions or other separate units of government created or established by law and any other public or private agency, person, partnership, corporation, or business entity acting on behalf of the City. 
2.  In General. In F.S. § 119.071(5), the Legislature acknowledges that the Social Security number was never intended to be used for business purposes but was intended to be used solely for the administration of the federal Social Security System. They further acknowledge that social security numbers are now used for identity verification and other legitimate purposes. 
Recognizing that the social security number can be used as a tool to perpetuate fraud, the City of New Smyrna Beach will comply with the State's requirements that: 
a.  An agency may not collect an individual's social security number unless the agency has stated in writing the purpose for its collection; 
b.  Social security numbers collected by an agency may not be used by the agency for any purpose other than the purpose provided in the written statement; 
c.  An agency collecting an individual's social security number must provide that individual with a copy of the written statement; 
d.  Each agency shall review whether its collection of social security numbers is in compliance with F.S. § 119.071(5); and 
e.  Each agency shall certify to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives its compliance with these requirements no later than January 31, 2008. 
    The City of New Smyrna Beach adopts the following written statement for the collection of social security numbers and will provide such statement to individuals when their social security number is obtained: 
    "The City of New Smyrna Beach adopts the written statement attached hereto for the collection of social security numbers and such statement to individuals when their social security number is obtained. The City hereby determines that obtaining an individual's social security number for the reasons identified in said statement is either specifically provided by law or is imperative for the City to fulfill its lawful duties and responsibilities." 
    The City acknowledges that social security numbers held by an agency, including those held before, on or after the effective date of this exemption, are confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s.24 (a), Art. I of the State Constitution. 
    Social security numbers may be disclosed to another agency or governmental entity if disclosure is necessary for the receiving agency or entity to perform its duties and responsibilities. Commercial entities engaged in commercial activity may access social security numbers through a public records request under the following conditions as provided for in F.S. § 119.071(5): 
    The "commercial entity" must be a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, proprietorship, sole proprietorship, firm, enterprise, franchise or association that performs a commercial activity in the State of Florida. 
    A "commercial activity" means the provision of a lawful product or service by a commercial entity. Commercial activity includes verification of the accuracy of personal information received by a commercial entity in the normal course of its business; use for insurance purposes; use in identifying and preventing fraud; use in matching, verifying, or retrieving information; and use in research activities. It does not include the display or bulk sale of social security numbers to the public or distribution of such numbers to any customer that is not identifiable by the commercial entity. 
    The social security numbers will be used only in the performance of a commercial activity and the commercial entity makes a written request for the social security numbers, which must: 
a.  Verify the written request under penalties of perjury as provided in F.S. § 92.525; 
b.  Be legibly signed by an authorized officer, employee, or agent of the commercial entity; 
c.  Contain the commercial entity's name, business mailing and location addresses, and business telephone number; and 
d.  Must request the specific purpose for which the commercial entity needs the social security numbers and how the social security numbers will be used in the performance of a commercial activity. 
    The City may request any other information reasonably necessary to verify the identity of a commercial entity requesting the social security numbers and the specific purposes for which the numbers will be used. Any person who makes a false representation in order to obtain a social security number commits a third degree felony. Any public officer who violates these provisions on providing social security numbers to commercial entities commits a non-criminal infraction, punishable by a fine not exceeding $500 per violation. 
    The City Clerk's Office shall be responsible for filing a report with the Executive Office of the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives by January 31 of each year. This report must identify all commercial entities that have requested social security numbers during the preceding calendar year, and the specific purpose or purposes stated by each commercial entity regarding its need for social security numbers. If no disclosures were made, the City shall so indicate on the report.

    The City of New Smyrna Beach's decisions involving persons who have communicable diseases shall be based on current and well-informed medical judgments concerning the disease, the risks of transmitting the illness to others, the symptoms and special circumstances of each individual who has a communicable disease, and a careful weighing of the identified risks and the available alternative for responding to an employee with a communicable disease.

    The City of New Smyrna Beach will not discriminate against any job applicant or employee based on the individual having a communicable disease. Applicants and employees shall not be denied access to the workplace solely on the grounds that they have a communicable disease. The City reserves the right to exclude a person with a communicable disease from the workplace facilities, programs and functions if the organization finds that, based on a medical determination, such restriction is necessary for the welfare of the person who has the communicable disease and/or the welfare of others within the workplace.

2.  At-will Policy. Department Heads hired after March 1, 2010 by the City are hired "at will" unless otherwise stipulated by provisions of a formal contract.

b.  Department transfer; different classification or pay grade. An employee may be transferred to another department with a different job classification pay grade if he/she meets the minimum qualifications. 
c.  Department transfer; city initiated.

A transfer without a change in the employee's pay rate shall not be considered corrective action and is not grievable.

5.  Promotions. 
a.  Vacancies in positions above the lowest rank in any category in the classified service shall be filled as far as practical by the promotion of employees in the city service.

    Newly hired employees shall serve a probationary period of six (6) months which may be extended by the employer for an additional six (6) months. This period of time is established for the purpose of evaluating the employee's work quality, attendance, and other performance factors, and to determine how well he/she fits into the city's organization. It also gives the employee the opportunity to look at the city and decide whether he/she likes the new job or position and surroundings. During such probationary period, a probationary or new hire employee may be disciplined, laid off, suspended, or otherwise terminated by the city and such action shall not be subject to the grievance procedure set forth in these policies and procedures.

Any new hire employee terminated during his/her probationary period will not be entitled to receive unemployment compensation benefits, in accordance with Florida law. 
I. - Employee performance assessment system. 
1.  Scope and purpose. 
a.  An employee performance rating is a tool management must use to evaluate each employee's performance. The rating process is a means of comparing performance with established standards; 
b.  It is the supervisor's responsibility to be continuously aware of his/her subordinate's performance, and to continually evaluate in order to provide constructive criticism and guidance/mentoring on a current basis. Such a procedure will produce more meaningful service ratings and improve employee development. 
2.  Uses of performance ratings. 
a.  The performance evaluation is intended to improve employee performance and aid management in the decision making process. Used properly, the evaluation will: 
1.  Indicate to the employee how his/her performance has been evaluated by their immediate supervisor, bring out his/her strong and weak points, serve as the basis for discussion of how he/she can improve his/her performance, and provide for counseling of the individual employee; 
2.  Call attention to the need for employee training; 
3.  Provide the basis for granting salary adjustment, such as, general wage increase; 
4.  Determine an employee's potential for promotion; 
5.  Provide documentation that may be required for transfers or corrective actions. 
3.  Required procedures. 
a.  The Human Resources Department shall maintain a list of all employees and their evaluation schedule. Such list is to be reviewed monthly by each department for correctness. Each department head is to secure the proper evaluation form and ensure that all evaluations are performed in a timely and professional manner. 
b.  All performance evaluations shall be made by the employee's immediate supervisor and reviewed by a higher-level supervisor and/or department head. The immediate supervisor's evaluation shall not be changed by higher-level supervisors and/or department head; however, the reviewing supervisor and/or department head should attach any written comments deemed appropriate. 
c.  Each employee who has been given an original appointment, reinstatement, transfer, promotion, demotion, or reassignment shall have his/her performance evaluated two to four weeks prior to completion of six months of service in the class. An employee who has completed six months of service in a class shall have his/her performance evaluated again two to four weeks prior to completion of 12 months of service in the class. Employees who satisfy the probationary status and become regular status shall have annual performance evaluations thereafter. Special ratings for the purpose of recognizing performance that is other than satisfactory may be made at any time. 
d.  All performance ratings must be explained in detail, either on the rating form or in an attached statement, to specifically indicate strengths and weaknesses. The performance improvement plan must also be completed in detail. 
e.  In all cases where an employee receives a "below expectations" rating, the immediate supervisor shall discuss the rating with the employee and work with him/her in an attempt to assist in improving his/her performance. Such employee must be reevaluated each 90 days thereafter until: 
1.  His/her performance has improved and is evaluated at least "meets expectations"; or 
2.  Six months have elapsed without the employee receiving a rating of at least "meets expectations." 
In such cases, action shall be taken to remove the employee either through demotion or termination. 
f.  The results of the performance assessment rating shall be discussed with, and furnished to the employee after the rating has been finalized, and the employee will have an opportunity to reply. 
g.  The employee will be required to sign the rating certifying that he/she has been informed of the results. Employees refusing to sign the rating shall have such noted on the rating form and the given notation shall be witnessed. 
h.  The employee performance assessment evaluation or the results contained therein will not be subject to the grievance procedure set forth in these policies and procedures. 
4.  Employee performance assessment rating schedule. 
Substantially exceeds expectations. Any employee who receives an evaluation of "Substantially Exceeds Expectations" has demonstrated consistent, outstanding performance. This individual is one of a very few employees citywide who has distinguished oneself during the evaluation period. The employee has received no discipline of any nature; the employee's attitude to fellow city employees and the public is of the highest standard. The employee has exceeded many or most of the requirements of the job, department rules and regulations and standard operating procedures (when and where such regulations and procedures exist). 
This individual has exceeded most, if not all of the expectations detailed by the department head, assistant and/or supervisor(s) in the employee's previous annual evaluation and job assignments. 
An individual who "substantially exceeds expectations" demonstrated their leadership capability in all facets of employment with the city. The employee is able to anticipate needs and situations and respond in a professional manner that characterizes the highest standard of service to the public on a routine and consistent basis. Performance at this level is typically not achieved from evaluation to evaluation but reflects a combination of opportunities and performance which are consistently of the highest level. 
Meets expectations. An employee that receives an evaluation of "Meets Expectations" must have performed the elements of the job description, the department rules and regulations and the standard operating procedures (where such regulations and procedures exist) in a dependable, timely, quality manner. The individual must have met the expectations established by the department head, assistant and/or supervisor(s) in the previous evaluation or job assignment. 
The employee must respond to the public and fellow municipal employees in a positive and hospitable manner. The individual must have performed work in such a manner as characterizing the need for little or no supervision and exercise appropriate independent decision-making capability. Any individual achieving this level of evaluation should have had no disciplinary infractions of a Group II or Group III level and should not have any multiple Group I infractions. 
An evaluation of this level signifies that the employee is dependable, conscientious, hospitable, reliable, and performs responsibilities in a quality professional manner. She/he has performed all the functions of the position and service to the city and the residents. All employees should strive for this consistent level of attainment. It means the employee has performed well. 
Does not meet expectations. This category is indicative of an employee who during the last evaluation year failed to meet expectations. Expectations are defined as the elements of the job description which pertain to functions on behalf of the city; departmental rules and regulations, standard operating procedures (where such regulations and procedures exist) and those criteria established by the department head, assistant and/or supervisor(s) during the course of the annual evaluation, job assignment or any intermediate evaluation. 
Employees who receive an annual evaluation of "does not meet expectations" will receive an intermediate evaluation 90 days from their anniversary date to determine if improvement in performance has occurred. If an employee is rated as "meets or substantially exceeds expectations," no additional evaluation will be required until their next regularly scheduled annual evaluation. If an employee is still considered "does not meet expectations" after the first intermediate evaluation, a second and final intermediate evaluation will be completed within 60 days. 
Any employee who is still considered "does not meet expectations" as a result of the second intermediate evaluation will be released from employment. An employee who receives either "meets or substantially exceeds expectations" on this the final evaluation will not receive another evaluation until the next annual evaluation. Any employee who receives a "does not meet expectations" on the initial annual evaluation will not be eligible for a salary adjustment regardless of the results of the first intermediate or final intermediate evaluation. 
J. - Personnel reduction. 
    In the case of reduction (layoff), the city may consider such factors as an employee's skill, ability, efficiency, performance, and education. Where such factors as skill, ability, efficiency, performance, and education are otherwise equal, seniority shall be the determining factor. 
    No new employee shall be hired to fill the position vacated until the laid off employee has been given an opportunity to return to work for a period of up to 12 months from date of layoff. The last employee laid off shall be the first recalled. To be eligible for recall, the employee may be required to pass a physical examination and if required a drug screen. The employee will be notified by certified or registered mail of his/her recall and must return to work within 14 calendar days. Failure to respond to the recall notice within seven calendar days from the date of receipt (excluding holidays), or failure to pass applicable physical examinations/drug screen may result in forfeiture of recall rights. 
    Notification of recall will be made to the employee's last known address as shown on city personnel records. The employee must notify the city of any change of address in order to maintain recall rights. Employees who are laid off will receive the maximum accrued annual leave payment at the time of layoff. 
K. - Employment of relatives. 
    In accordance with F.S. § 112.3135, a public official of the city will not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion or advancement in or to a position in the city in which he/she is serving or over which he/she exercises jurisdiction or control, any individual who is a relative of the public official. 
    An individual may not be appointed, employed, promoted, or advanced in or to a position in the city if such appointment, employment, promotion or advancement has been advocated by a City official serving in or exercising jurisdiction or control over the city, who is a relative of the individual. 
    For purposes of this section, the term "public official" means an officer, manager, department head, or supervisor in whom is vested the authority by law, rule, or regulation, or to whom the authority has been delegated, to recommend individuals for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement in connection with the employment in an agency. 
    The City wants to ensure that practices do not create situations such as conflict of interest or favoritism. This extends to practices that involve employee hiring, promotion and transfer. Close relatives, partners, those in a dating relationship or members of the same household are not permitted to be in positions that have a reporting responsibility to each other. 
    Close relative means an individual who is related to the public official as parent, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, spouse, nephew, niece, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, step relatives half-brother, or half-sister and domestic partners. 
    Current employees who marry each other or become involved in a domestic partnership or dating will be permitted to continue employment with the City provided they do not work in a direct supervisory relationship with each other or pose difficulties. If employees who marry, live together or dating, do work in a direct supervisory relationship with each other, the City will attempt to reassign on the employees to another position for which he or she is qualified if such a position is available. If no position is available, one or the other employee may be required to leave City employment. 
    The City reserves the right to apply this policy to situations where there is a conflict or the potential for conflict because of the relationship between employees, even if there is no direct-reporting relationship or authority involved.

Any notice to engage in outside employment granted as herein before provided may be canceled or terminated at any time by the City Manager upon giving sufficient written notice to the employee to whom said permission was granted. 
4.  No employee granted permission to engage in outside employment shall work at said outside employment for a longer period of time or a different place of employment than stated in said request. 
5.  Any employee accepting outside employment under the terms of this rule shall make arrangements with the outside employer to be relieved from his/her outside duties if and when called for emergency service by the city.

In addition, employees are not to solicit or conduct any outside business during paid working time. 
8.  Employees sustaining injuries while engaged in outside employment are ineligible to receive benefits under the city's workers' compensation plan on account of injury resulting from the outside employment. 
M. - Rest periods. 
    Rest breaks will be arranged so as not to interfere with city business. Misuse of the rest break may subject the employee to appropriate corrective action. It shall be the responsibility of the supervisors to enforce this provision. Rest breaks are usually scheduled for 15 minutes in the first half of the shift and 15 minutes in the second half of the shift, according to the needs of the department. 
N. - Termination of employment. 
    Employees are required to give proper notice, in writing, of voluntary termination or retirement to their department head. 
 Proper notice is considered four weeks for Department Heads, three weeks for exempt/salaried position and two weeks for all others. The use of scheduled or unscheduled personal leave time paid or unpaid is not permitted after proper notice is given. 
 The use of personal leave time or holidays shall not be counted toward this notice period. 
 Upon resignation/termination, probationary employees are not entitled to receive any payment of accrued personal leave. 
 If an employee provides less notice than requested, the City may deem the individual to be ineligible for rehire depending on the circumstances regarding the notice given. 
 Job abandonment: Employees who fail to report to work or contact their supervisor for three (3) consecutive workdays shall be considered to have abandoned the job without notice, effective at the end of their normal shift on the third day. The supervisor shall notify the Human Resources department at the expiration of the third workday and initiate the paperwork to terminate the employee. Employees who are separated due to job abandonment are ineligible to receive accrued benefits and are ineligible for rehire.

O. - Volunteer/Internship Policy. 
Purpose: To inform Department Heads about the City's policy regarding the procedures for recruiting and utilizing volunteers in city departments. 
Review: The City greatly benefits from the services provided by skilled and motivated volunteers and encourages involvement by New Smyrna Beach citizens. The procedures for recruitment, selection and placement assist the City and the volunteer to establish and maintain a beneficial relationship. Volunteers are individuals who are non-paid, including interns and work study program students. 
Procedure: The Human Resources Department will continually and successfully recruit volunteers for various functions and events, both long-term and short term commitments and maintain a roster of interested individuals. Departments may contact Human Resources Department directly concerning volunteer needs and the recruitment, selection placement process will begin. Other times, the department may be directly contacted by the interested volunteer. Either way, a written description of duties is required for a successful experience and the Human Resources Department can work with departments to create the description prior to recruitment efforts. 
The Leisure Services Department independently recruits, screens, selects and places volunteers for their youth athletic programs. The Human Resources Department will assist with recruiting and screening as needed. 
1.  If the volunteer applicant contacts Human Resources Department directly concerning opportunities, the applicant will complete a volunteer application form and will be interviewed by Human Resources Department. A candidate package comprised of the Volunteer Application will be forwarded to the appropriate staff member in areas that the volunteer is seeking to be placed. The appropriate staff member contacts the potential volunteer, within three (3) business days, to discuss volunteer opportunities and conduct an interview. If the applicant is selected, notify Human Resources Department of selection and complete the appropriate screenings. 
2.  The appropriate staff member may conduct an interview prior to the potential volunteer contacting Human Resources Department. Should the department wish to utilize the volunteer, he/she must be directed to Human Resources Department for mandatory screening. The appropriate staff member should notify Human Resources Department. The individual will then complete the application. 
Non-Selected Applicants: If the department chooses not to select the volunteer, it is courteous and professional to call the applicant and share the reason for non-selection in a positive manner. 
Screenings: All City volunteers must be registered with Human Resources Department and successfully complete a background screening prior to placement. This requirement also applies to youth participating in community service hour programs. There is a cost associated with the background screening for volunteers. This cost would need to be approved and paid for by the department in which the volunteer will be placed. Drug testing is required for volunteers. Managers must ensure that volunteers have been drug screened. 
Some volunteer positions may require additional screening applicable to duties to be performed. Volunteers who are inactive for two (2) years or more will be required to undergo re-screening. 
The only exemption is for volunteers that register to assist with a certain special event such a festival, holiday celebration and similar special group projects etc. Appropriate supervisory controls shall be utilized in managing volunteers at special events. 
City badges are not issued to volunteers except in very limited circumstances. 
Placement: Once a volunteer has been cleared by Human Resources Department, the department will be notified. The department is responsible to contact the volunteer to set up the report to duty. Please note that often small details and considerations become routine to "regular employees" and the volunteer may feel out of place. Departments are encouraged to orient the volunteer to the specific work environment and to find ways to show the City's appreciation. 
Special Event Volunteers: Special event volunteers are only to be used to support a specific event which may last a day or up to a week. These volunteers are not ongoing and can be recruited from a number of sources such as high schools, colleges, churches, military, and/or local businesses. 
P. - Access to Personnel Files. 
    Employee files are maintained by the Human Resources department and are subject requirements of the Florida Statutes concerning accessibility. Personnel file access by current employees and former employees upon request will generally be permitted within 3 days of the request unless otherwise required under state law. Personnel files are to be reviewed in the Human Resources department. Employee files may not be taken outside of the department. Representatives of government or law enforcement agencies and public may be allowed access to file information under Public Records Law.

2.  Should the position be reclassified to a job classification with the same pay grade as that of the original classification, the incumbent employee shall receive a corresponding change in title without a change in compensation, provided the reclassified position is in the same line and character of work and involves the same basic duties, responsibilities and skills.

B. - Use. 
    The salary/compensation plan is to reward employees for satisfactory performance, develop incentives among employees to improve their quality and performance of work.

J. - Leave of absence. 
1.  The decision to grant a leave of absence is a matter of administrative discretion. It shall be incumbent upon the department head to weigh and determine each case on its own merits. For any leave of absence for a period in excess of seven calendar days an employee must submit a Leave of Absence request and have the approval of the City Manager. In each case, the city shall make a reasonable effort to return the employee to his/her former position or a similar position of the same classification in another department. If no opening exists, the employee shall be placed on an eligibility list for a period of six months. All departments are required to adhere to the following practices:

A maximum delinquency period of one pay period will be enforced for payment of premiums. If a monthly premium is delinquent and payment is not made by cash or payroll deduction on/or before the next applicable pay period, coverage will be canceled as of the beginning of the delinquent period. Where the employee will be out of town during an approved leave exceeding 30 days, payment arrangements must be made in advance so that premiums are kept current. If any coverage is canceled during an approved leave of absence, it will be reinstated as required for new employees. 
k.  Regular full time employees eligible for City provided short term disability coverage must apply if absence will exceed 15 calendar days (all city equipment must be turned into the department while on approved leave). 
K. - Family and medical leave. 
1.  General Provisions. It is the policy of the City to grant up to 12 weeks of family and medical leave during any 12-month period to eligible employees, in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) and up to 26 weeks of leave in any 12-month period in compliance with the expansion of FMLA under The Support for Injured Service members Act of 2008. The leave may be paid, unpaid or a combination of paid and unpaid leave, depending on the circumstances of the leave and as specified in this policy. An application for leave of absence must be completed. 
2.  Eligibility. To qualify to take family or medical leave under this policy, the employee must meet all of the following conditions: 
a.  The employee must have worked for the City for 12 months or 52 weeks. The 12 months or 52 weeks need not have been consecutive. For eligibility purposes, an employee will be considered to have been employed for an entire week even if the employee was on the payroll for only part of the week or if the employee is on leave during the week. 
b.  The employee must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately before the date when the leave is requested to commence. The principles established under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) determine the number of hours worked by an employee. The FLSA does not include time spent on paid or unpaid leave as hours worked. Consequently, these hours of leave should not be counted in determining the 1,250 hours eligibility test for an employee under FMLA. 
3.  Type of Leave Covered. To qualify as FMLA leave under this policy, the employee must be taking leave for one of the reasons listed below: 
a.  The birth of a child and in order to care for that child. 
b.  The placement of a child for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly placed child. 
c.  To care for a spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition. 
d.  The serious health condition (described below) of the employee. 
An employee may take leave because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's position. 
A serious health condition is defined as a condition that requires inpatient care at a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility, including any period of incapacity or any subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient care or a condition that requires continuing care by a licensed health care provider. 
This policy covers illnesses of a serious and long-term nature, resulting in recurring or lengthy absences. Generally, a chronic or long-term health condition, which, if left untreated, would result in a period of incapacity of more than three days, would be considered a serious health condition. 
Employees with questions about what illnesses are covered under this FMLA policy or under the City's leave policy are encouraged to consult with the Human Resource department. 
The City may require an employee to provide a doctor's certification of the serious health condition. The certification process is outlined in section J of this policy. If an employee takes paid sick leave for a condition that progresses into a serious health condition and the employee requests unpaid leave as provided under this policy, the City may designate all or some portion of related leave taken as leave under this policy, to the extent that the earlier leave meets the necessary qualifications. 
4.  A covered family member's active duty or call to active duty in the Armed Forces. An employee whose spouse, son, daughter or parent either has been notified of an impending call or order to active military duty or who is already on active duty may take up to 12 weeks of leave for reasons related to or affected by the family member's call-up or service. Reasons related to the call-up or service includes helping the family member prepare for the departure or caring for children of the service member. The leave may commence as soon as the individual receives the call-up notice. (Son or daughter for this type of FMLA leave is defined the same as for child for other types of FMLA leave, except that the person does not have to be a minor.) This type of leave would be counted toward the employee's 12-week maximum of FMLA leave in a 12-month period. 
Employees requesting this type of FMLA leave must provide proof of the qualifying family member's call-up or active military service before leave is granted. 
5.  To care for an injured or ill service member. This leave may extend to up to 26 weeks in a 12-month period for an employee whose spouse, son, daughter, parent or next-of-kin is injured or recovering from an injury suffered while on active military duty and who is unable to perform the duties of the service member's office, grade, rank or rating. Next-of-kin is defined as the closest blood relative of the injured or recovering service member. An employee is also eligible for this type of leave when the family service member is receiving medical treatment, recuperation or therapy, even if the service member is on temporary disability retired list. 
Employees requesting this type of FMLA leave must provide certification of the family member or next-of-kin's injury, recovery or need for care. This certification is not tied to a serious health condition as for other types of FMLA leave. This is the only type of FMLA leave that may extend an employee's leave entitlement beyond 12 weeks to 26 weeks. Other types of FMLA leave are included with this type of leave totaling the 26 weeks. 
An eligible employee can take up to 12 weeks (or up to 26 weeks of leave to care for an injured or ill service member) under this policy during any 12-month period. The City will measure the 12-month period as a rolling 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any leave under this policy. Each time an employee takes leave, the city will compute the amount of leave the employee has taken under this policy in the last 12 months and subtract it from the 12 weeks (or 26 weeks for the care of an injured or ill service member) of available leave, with the balance remaining being the amount the employee is entitled to take at that time. 
If a husband and wife both work for the City and each wishes to take leave for the birth of a child, adoption or placement of a child in foster care, or to care for a parent (but not a parent in-law) with a serious health condition, the husband and wife may only take a combined total of 12 weeks of leave. If a husband and wife both work for the City and each wishes to take leave to care for a covered injured or ill service member, the husband and wife may only take a combined total of 26 weeks of leave. 
6.  Employee Status and Benefits during Leave. While an employee is on leave, the City will continue the employee's health benefits during the leave period at the same level and under the same conditions as if the employee had continued to work. 
Under current City policy, the employee pays a portion of the health care premium. While on paid leave, the employer will continue to make payroll deductions to collect the employee's share of the premium. While on unpaid leave, the employee must continue to make this payment, either in person or by mail. The payment must be received in the Finance department by the due date of each month. If the payment is more than 30 days late, the employee's health care coverage may be dropped for the duration of the leave. The City will provide 15 days' notification prior to the employee's loss of coverage. 
If the employee contributes to a life insurance or disability plan, the City will continue making payroll deductions while the employee is on paid leave. While the employee is on unpaid leave, the employee may request continuation of such benefits and pay his/her portion of the premiums; or the City may elect to maintain such benefits during the leave and pay the employee's share of the premium payments. If the employee does not continue these payments, the City may discontinue coverage during the leave. If the City maintains coverage, the employer may recover the costs incurred for paying the employee's share of any premiums whether or not the employee returns to work. 
The employee shall not be entitled to the accrual of seniority or other benefits during the term of the leave, unless required by law. 
7.  Employee Status after Leave. An employee who takes leave under this policy will be able to return to the same position or a position with equivalent status, pay, benefits and other employment terms. The position will be the same or virtually identical in terms of pay, benefits and working conditions. 
If the employee is unable to return to work upon the conclusion of the family medical leave, a review committee consisting of the department head and Director of Human Resources will review the case and determine whether or not family and medical leave should be extended and for how long. The review committee shall consider the employee's progress toward recovery, operational needs of the employee's department, reasonable accommodations which may be made in the employee's job duties, the employee's prior performance, evaluations and disciplinary actions and any other information that would contribute to an informed decision. The review committee's decision shall be subject to the final approval of the City Manager. If family and medical leave is not extended, employment may be terminated in accordance with applicable state law, or the employee may be placed on a leave of absence in accordance with section VIII J of these personnel policies and procedures. 
8.  Use of Paid and Unpaid Leave. An employee who is taking FMLA leave because of the employee's own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a family member must use all paid vacation, personal or sick leave prior to being eligible for unpaid leave. Leave may be run concurrently with FMLA leave if the reason for the FMLA leave is covered by the established leave policy. 
Disability leave for the birth of the child and for an employee's serious health condition, including workers' compensation leave (to the extent that it qualifies), will be designated as FMLA leave and will run concurrently with FMLA. For example, if an employer provides six weeks of pregnancy disability leave, the six weeks will be designated as FMLA leave and counted toward the employee's 12-week entitlement. The employee may then be required to substitute accrued (or earned) paid leave as appropriate before being eligible for unpaid leave for what remains of the 12-week entitlement. 
An employee who is taking leave for the adoption or foster care of a child must use all paid vacation and personal leave prior to being eligible for unpaid leave. 
9.  Intermittent Leave or a Reduced Work Schedule. The employee may take FMLA leave in 12 consecutive weeks, may use the leave intermittently (take a day periodically when needed over the year) or, under certain circumstances, may use the leave to reduce the work week or work day, resulting in a reduced hour schedule. In all cases, the leave may not exceed a total of 12 work weeks (or 26 work weeks to care for an injured or ill service member over a 12-month period). 
The City may temporarily transfer an employee to an available alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits if the alternative position would better accommodate the intermittent or reduced schedule, in instances of when leave for the employee or employee's family member is foreseeable and for planned medical treatment, including recovery from a serious health condition. 
If the employee is taking leave for a serious health condition or because of the serious health condition of a family member, the employee should try to reach agreement with the City before taking intermittent leave or working a reduced hour schedule. If this is not possible, then the employee must prove that the use of the leave is medically necessary. The City may require certification of the medical necessity as discussed in Sections J and K. 
10.  Certification of the Serious Health Condition of the Employee or the Spouse, Child or Parent of the Employee. The City may ask for certification of the serious health condition. The employee must respond to such a request within 15 days of the request or provide a reasonable explanation for the delay. Failure to provide certification may result in a denial of continuation of leave. Medical certification may be provided by using the Medical Certification Form. Request for a medical certificate must be made in writing as part of the City response to employee request for leave. 
Certification of the serious health condition shall include the date when the condition began, its expected duration and a brief statement of treatment. For medical leave for the employee's own medical condition, the certification must also include a statement that the employee is unable to perform work of any kind or a statement that the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the employee's position. For a family member who is seriously ill, the certification must include a statement that the patient, the family member, requires assistance and that the employee's presence would be beneficial or desirable. 
If the employee plans to take intermittent leave or work a reduced schedule, the certification must also include dates and the duration of treatment as well as a statement of medical necessity for taking intermittent leave or working a reduced schedule. 
The City has the right to ask for a second opinion if it has reason to doubt the certification. The City will pay for the employee to get a certification from a second doctor, which the City will select. If necessary to resolve a conflict between the original certification and the second opinion, the City will require the opinion of a third doctor. The City and the employee will mutually select the third doctor, and the City will pay for the opinion. This third opinion will be considered final. The employee will be provisionally entitled to leave and benefits under the FMLA pending the second and/or third opinion. 
11.  Documentation of the Covered Family Member's Active Duty or Call to Active Duty in the Armed Forces. Employees requesting this type of service member FMLA leave must provide proof of the qualifying family member's call-up or active military service. This documentation may be a copy of the military orders or other official Armed Forces communication. 
12.  Documentation of the Need for Service member FMLA Leave to Care for an Injured or Ill Service member. Employees requesting this type of Service member FMLA leave must provide documentation of the family member's or next-of-kin's injury, recovery or need for care. This documentation may be a copy of the military medical information, orders for treatment, or other official Armed Forces communication pertaining to the service member's injury or illness incurred on active military duty that renders the member medically unfit to perform his or her military duties. 
13.  Procedure for Requesting Leave for: 
a.  The birth of a child or in order to care for that child; 
b.  The placement of a child for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly placed child; 
c.  To care for a spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition; or 
d.  The serious health condition of the employee. 
All employees requesting this type of FMLA leave must provide verbal notice with an explanation of the reason(s) for the needed leave to their immediate supervisor, who will advise the Human Resource department. If the leave is foreseeable, the immediate supervisor may require the employee to provide a written request for leave and reasons(s) with a copy to the Human Resource department. Failure of the employee to provide a written request for leave cannot be grounds to deny or delay the taking of FMLA leave. 
The City will provide individual notice of rights and obligations to each employee requesting leave within two business days or as soon as practicable. For employees on intermittent or recurring leave for the same incident, this notice will be provided every six months. 
When an employee plans to take leave under this policy, the employee must give the City 30 days' notice. If it is not possible to give 30 days' notice, the employee must give as much notice as is practicable. An employee who is to undergo planned medical treatment is required to make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment in order to minimize disruptions to the City's operations. 
If an employee fails to provide 30 days' notice for foreseeable leave with no reasonable excuse for the delay, the leave request may be denied until at least 30 days from the date the employer receives notice. While on leave, employees are requested to report periodically to the City regarding the status of the medical condition and their intent to return to work. 
14.  Procedure for Requesting Leave for 1) a covered family member's active duty or call to active duty in the Armed Forces or 2) to care for an injured or ill service member. All employees requesting this type of FMLA leave must provide verbal notice with an explanation of the reason(s) for the needed leave to their immediate supervisor, who will advise the Human Resource department. Leave may commence as soon as the individual receives the call-up notice. If the leave is foreseeable, the immediate supervisor may require the employee to provide a written request for leave and reasons(s) with a copy to the Human Resource department. 
The City will provide individual notice of rights and obligations to each employee requesting leave within two business days or as soon as practicable. 
L. - Personal Leave Donation Program. 
    New Smyrna Beach employees may donate accumulated leave to employees who are eligible for coverage under Family Medical Leave Act and have a serious medical condition. 
    Employees with serious medical conditions may seek limited financial relief through the donation of leave from fellow employees. This will enable employees to compensation after all accrued leave has been exhausted. Such a policy is based on compassion and generosity and may promote a spirit of cohesiveness and mutual support among employees. 
Scope: Donation of leave time may be made among City employees and is based on the dollar value of the leave donated. 
An employee is eligible to receive donated leave under the following circumstances: 
1.  The employee is a regular status employee who is eligible for coverage under the City's FMLA policy, requiring 12 months of service, and 
2.  The employee has exhausted all personal leave, sick leave, vacation leave, and compensatory time, and 
3.  The employee must have a serious health condition as defined under the FMLA, and 
4.  The employee is not eligible to receive payments from the retirement system of which they are a member, and 
5.  The employee is not eligible to receive social security disability benefits, and 
6.  The employee is not eligible for any publicly funded financial assistance program for disability. 
7.  Employees on pregnancy leave may accept donations for time off the job through the 6 th week post-partum or longer if certified by a physician as having a serious health condition. 
    The dollar ratio of donated leave will be adjusted proportionately to the salaries of the donor and recipient. The City Human Resources Department is responsible for making such determination. The recipient and the City are under no obligation to repay the donated hours of monies. 
    No one employee may reduce his or her leave balance through donation to less than 80 hours of leave. There is no limit to the amount of compensatory time that may be donated. The recipient may receive donations from any number of donor employees. Donations are transferred to the recipients personal leave balance. 
    The recipient of the donated (transferred) hours has a serious health condition he/she must currently be on an approved medical leave of absence without pay and possess a doctor's certification specifying that the recipient is not yet able to return to work. 
    Exceptions to this policy require written approval from the City Manager. 
a.  To initiate the transfer of leave, the donor must voluntarily request the "Donation of Leave" form from the Human Resources Department. He/She must indicate the recipient and then complete the "Donor" portion of the form and sign the form before a Notary Public. After completion of the donor information, the form is forwarded to the recipient's department. 
b.  The recipient's department then completes the recipient's section of the form, and attaches the doctor's certificate of unavailability to perform their current duties, as outlined. The completed form is then sent to the Human Resources Department for approval. 
c.  The Human Resources Department will then verify doctor's certification (additional information may be requested as necessary). After approval, the original copy of the form is then kept by the Human Resources Department. Copies will then be forwarded to the Finance Department, the recipient, recipient's department, and the donor. 
d.  If not approved, the Human Resources Department will so indicate reason for disallowance on the form and copies will be sent to all the appropriate parties. 
M. - Domestic Violence Leave. 
    In accordance with F.S. § 741.313, any employee who has been employed with the City for three or more months may request to take up to three working days of leave from work in any 12-month period, if the employee or a family or household member of an employee is the victim of domestic violence. For the purposes of this leave, the following definitions shall apply. 
 Domestic violence - any assault; aggravated assault; battery; aggravated battery; sexual assault; sexual battery; stalking; aggravated stalking; kidnapping; false imprisonment or any criminal offense resulting in physical injury or death of one family or household member by another family or household member. 
 Family or household member - spouses; former spouses; persons related by blood or marriage; persons who are presently residing together as if a family or who have resided together in the past as if a family; and persons who are parents of a child in common regardless of whether they have been married. With the exception of persons who have a child in common, the family or household members must be currently residing or have in the past resided together in the same single dwelling unit. 
 Victim - an individual who has been subjected to domestic violence. Domestic violence leave will be granted to enable an employee to: 
1.  Seek an injunction for protection against domestic violence or an injunction for protection in cases of repeat violence, dating violence, or sexual violence; 
2.  Obtain medical care or mental health counseling, or both, for the employee or a family or household member, to address physical or psychological injuries resulting from the act of domestic violence; 
3.  Obtain services from a victim-services organization, including, but not limited to, a domestic violence shelter or program or a rape crisis center as a result of the act of domestic violence;

5.  Seek legal assistance in addressing issues arising from the act of domestic violence or to attend and prepare for court-related proceedings arising from the act of domestic violence. 
Except in cases of imminent danger to the health or safety of the employee, family or household member, an employee seeking domestic violence leave must provide the City advance notice of the leave by completing and submitting an established Request for Leave of Absence form with accompanying documentation to substantiate the act of violence. 
Information and documents relating to the need or request for domestic violence leave are exempt from Florida Statutes Chapter 119 public records requirements, so leave requests and supporting documents will be maintained confidentially by the Human Resources Department. 
Employee completed Leave of Absence request forms are to be submitted to the immediate supervisor and then forwarded to the Department Director, Human Resources and the City Manager for consideration. Human Resources will notify the employee of the leave request determination and will provide a description of rights and obligations with regard to the leave. 
At the City's discretion and depending upon the availability of accrued leave benefits, domestic violence leave may be paid, unpaid or a combination of paid and unpaid. Additionally, terms and conditions of such leave shall be in accordance with Section VIII, J, Leaves of Absence; employees authorized to take domestic violence leave will be subject to adhering to these same terms and conditions. 
The City will not condone retaliation, discrimination or adverse employment action being taken against any employee who exercises his right to request and receive the benefit of domestic violence leave. 
SECTION IX. - SAFETY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION 

A. - Safety policy. 
    It is the policy of the city that every employee is entitled to work under the safest possible conditions in the many occupations the city represents. To this end, every reasonable effort will be made to provide and maintain a safe and healthy work place, safe equipment, proper materials, and to establish and insist upon safe methods and practices at all times. 
    Accidents that injure people, damage machinery, or equipment and destroy materials or property cause needless suffering, inconvenience, and expense. 
    Safety rules and regulations are developed for protection. These rules and regulations are to be considered directive in nature and applicable to all employees. 
    It is a basic responsibility of all employees to make safety realization a part of their daily, hourly concern. Employees are obligated to observe the rules of conduct and safety, and to properly use the safety equipment provided. 
    People are our most important asset; their safety our greatest responsibility. 
B. - Work spaces. 
    Workspaces of New Smyrna Beach employees are considered an integral part of City property. Work areas including, but not limited to, offices, desks, lockers and files are not to be considered private areas of individual employees with an expectation of privacy. Material produced by City employees and produced on or stored on computer medial with City facilities are not be considered personal property of individual employees with the expectation of privacy. 
    Searches of work areas including, but not limited to, offices desks, lockers and files may be conducted without notice only upon the specific authorization either written or verbal, of the City Manager, or their designee, and only for reasonable cause. Any such search must be conducted by at least two persons, one of whom must be at the level of Department Director or above. 
    Access to any material produced by City employees and produced on or stored on computer medial with City facilities is strictly controlled by security protocols established and promulgated by the Information Technology Department. 
    Employee's assigned specific workspaces within City facilities are personally responsible for maintaining such areas in a manner that will not produce safety hazards to the employee or others and which produce an image of neatness, orderliness, and efficiency when viewed by other. 
    Elected Officials, City Manager, Assistant City Manager, and Department Directors establish Workspace safety and appearance standards within their areas of responsibility. Within such established standards, employees may personalize their individual workspaces to include photographs, wall hangings, plants, and small item of a personal nature if in keeping with good taste and professionalism expected of City employees by the public. While an employee may bring personal items into their workspaces, they remain solely responsible for their security. City of New Smyrna Beach will not be responsible for the loss of any personal items. Employees are particularly discouraged from eating in public view at their workstations and in proximity of computer equipment. 
C. - Accident prevention. 
    All department heads and supervisors must recognize their responsibilities for a successful safety program, and will participate in the development, implementation and improvement of a citywide safety program designed to eliminate unnecessary accidents and needless expense. Supervisors must have a continuing concern with all possible operational economies. 
    The comprehensive citywide programs will be under the direction of the Director of Human Resources, who will: 
1.  Develop an appropriate education and training program; and 
2.  Establish and enforce rules and regulations that will ensure reaching all of the objectives of this program. 
    Violations observed by the Director of Human Resources shall be reported to the appropriate department head in writing, for corrective action. 
D. - Safety equipment and devices. 
    The city will provide proper and necessary safety equipment and devices for employees engaged in work where such special equipment and devices are necessary. Such equipment and devices, where provided, must be used. Failure by employees to utilize provided equipment or devices will be subject to corrective action. 
E. - Safety committee. 
    In order to develop a safety program, a committee shall be established consisting of no less than six and no more than ten city employees. The City Manager shall designate an individual as chairperson of the committee whose duties shall be to preside over all meetings and coordinate with the Director of Human Resources on all matters. These individuals may be volunteers or may be designated by the department head. Their responsibilities shall be [to]: 
1.  Establish a regular meeting time and publish an agenda. 
2.  Review accident reports and help verify causes. 
3.  Recommend corrective action. 
4.  Review employee safety suggestions. 
5.  Hear and investigate employee complaints on hazardous conditions, material or equipment. 
6.  Publish minutes of meetings, to include committee recommendations, and direct these to management. 
    The city recognizes the substantial benefits that can arise from a healthier workforce. These benefits include reduced insurance claims, increased productivity, a reduction in employees lost time, and increased employee morale and wellbeing. 
    Therefore, the City Manager is authorized to implement an employee fitness program. This program may allow employees to participate in the various recreational activities and programs offered by the city. The participation by employees in such programs is not to result in any direct costs to the city. 
    Also, such participation is strictly based on excess space, availability and capacity. In no event shall an employee preempt the participation by any member of the community. 
    Participation shall be during an employee's non-duty time and subject to all rules, regulations and policies as established by the City Manager and/or program. 
F. - On-the-job injuries. 
    All employees shall be advised of their responsibility to immediately report to their supervisor all injuries that occur on the job. Delay in reporting an injury can cause complications of the injury and delay recovery. 
    Employees injured on the job must contact their immediate supervisor who will call 911 if in a medical emergency. The first responders will administer emergency treatment at the scene and provide for the appropriate care. The supervisor will provide an authorization if medical care or time-off for medical care is required. The supervisor will also perform the accident investigation and injury report. 
    Injury reports will be submitted to the Director of Human Resources within 48 hours after the occurrence of the injury or the report of the injury. If the injury occurs over a holiday or weekend, the injury report should then be submitted within 48 hours from the time the work period starts after the weekend or holiday. This applies to all on-the-job injuries, as well as any one injured in a vehicular accident involving city equipment. 
    If City vehicle and/or property is involved in the injury, a copy of the report must be forwarded to the City attorney's office no later than the following business day after the occurrence for processing of claim to FMIT. 
G. - Vehicle accident reporting procedures. 
1.  In the case of any city-owned vehicle that is involved in a motor vehicle accident, the employee will immediately notify the police department and his/her supervisor. The supervisor must also notify the City Attorney's office no later than the following business day. The police department will provide the City Attorney's office with the City Vehicle Accident Report and notify the Director of Human Resources of the accident. In the event the employee's supervisor is not available, another supervisor from within that department will be dispatched to the accident scene. 
2.  The department of the employee involved in the motor vehicle accident will ensure that an accident report is completed and copies of this report will be forwarded to the Director of Human Resources and City Attorney within two working days of the time the accident occurred. 
3.  In case of serious injury or fatality, the police department and the Director of Human Resources shall be notified immediately. 
4.  Employees involved in a vehicle accident are required to submit to drug screening immediately following or if after hours by the next morning. 
H. - Workers' compensation for injured employees. 
    Payment of workers' compensation to all employees who are disabled because of an injury arising out of and in the course of performing their duties with the city will be governed by the Florida State Workers' Compensation Law. 
1.  Notification. Notification of all job-related injuries and accidents shall be in accordance with [sub] section[s] F and G above. 
2.  Medical treatment. Employees sustaining job-related injuries or illnesses will be referred to a physician selected by the city. If the employee is not satisfied by the treatment received from that physician, the city will select another physician. The treating physician (health care provider) shall not refer the employee to another health care provider, diagnostic facility, pain program, work hardening program, therapy center, or other facility without the authorization of the city/city's workers' compensation carrier except in cases where emergency care is required. If chiropractic treatment is recommended by the physician or preferred by the employee, the chiropractor will be selected by the city. Employees will not be permitted to select their own physicians. 
Expenses incurred in such examinations or treatment will be borne by the city/city's workers' compensation carrier in accordance with the Florida State Workers' Compensation Law. Reports of such examinations and treatment received by the city shall become a part of the employee's medical file. 
3.  Workers' compensation; differential payments. Full wages will be paid for the day of the job-related injury or illness, or for that part of the day spent receiving medical care and for the first seven calendar days (if a lost time injury). 
An employee sustaining a lost-time injury with personal leave, sick and/or annual leave credited to his/her account, may request the department head or comparable level supervisor to apply any accrued personal leave then sick and/or annual leave to obtain full base pay while absent from duty. In no case shall the amount of workers' compensation, personal leave, sick leave, annual leave, or any other payments received by the employee exceed the employee's base pay for that period. 
4.  Benefits accruals and insurance. Personal leave will continue to accrue for 12 weeks following the week in which the job-related injury occurred. After such time, personal leave accruals shall cease. 
The city shall continue to provide and pay the employee medical insurance in the same manner and to the same extent that such insurance existed prior to the accident while employee is on workers' compensation leave of absence. If the employee is not receiving additional payments of personal, sick, then the city shall pay employee's portion of dependent insurance coverage, if any not to exceed a total period of leave of absence of 12 months. 
5.  Case review and notice. The employee shall be instructed to keep the department head and Director of Human Resources informed of employee's status, progress to recovery and anticipated date to return to work and will cooperate with city on the review of employee's case. During the workers' compensation leave of absence, the Director of Human Resources shall consult regularly with the employee's treating physician and workers' compensation carrier to determine employee's progress toward recovery and date of maximum medical improvement. 
In no event shall an employee on a job-related disability return to work without certification of the employee's attending physician and approval of the Director of Human Resources or designee. 
However, upon approval of the employee's attending physician, the City Manager may transfer the employee to another position within the city which the employee is capable of performing, and/or the City Manager may modify the duties of the employee within the limitations prescribed by the employee's physician. 
If employee has not returned to his/her regular duty work assignment without restriction after 12 weeks of the date of injury, a review committee consisting of the department head and Director of Human Resources will review the case and determine whether or not workers' compensation leave of absence should be extended and for how long. The review committee shall consider the employee's progress toward recovery, operational needs of the employee's department, reasonable accommodations which may be made in the employee's job duties, the employee's prior performance, evaluations and disciplinary actions and any other information that would contribute to an informed decision. The review committee's decision shall be subject to the final approval of the City Manager. 
If workers' compensation leave of absence is not extended, employment may be terminated in accordance with applicable state law or the employee may be placed on a leave of absence in accordance with subsection VIII, J. of these personnel policies and procedures. In no event shall the employee's workers' compensation leave of absence exceed 12 months total time for any single injury, or multiple lost time injuries during a four-year period. Whether an injury is a single injury or a separate injury shall be determined by the city's workers' compensation carrier. The time incurred by an employee on workers' compensation leave of absence shall be counted as time incurred for family and medical leave purposes. 
SECTION X. - CORRECTIVE ACTIONS 

A. - Employees. 
1.  Introduction. The following corrective actions apply to all city employees. 
Each division is cumulative with regard to behavior, work, role, and procedural or policy violation. 
2.  General. It is the policy of the City of New Smyrna Beach to emphasize an individual's responsibility for managing their performance and behavior. The city's system of corrective actions focuses on communicating an expectation of change and improvement in a personal, adult, non-threatening way while at the same time maintaining concern for the seriousness of the situation. Key aspects of this system include recognizing and encouraging good performance, correcting performance problems through counseling, and building commitment to effective work standards and safe work practices. 
If an employee has a conduct, attendance or work performance problem, corrective action may be necessary to address the situation. 
The city's approach is designed to provide the opportunity to correct deficient performance and build commitment (not merely compliance) to expected performance in a manner that is fair and equitable to all employees. Each step is a reminder of expected performance, stressing decision-making and individual responsibility, not punishment. 
Corrective actions are normally progressive in nature, except where the seriousness of the offense warrants deviation from the normal progressive disciplinary system. All documentation should be forwarded to Human Resources for filing in Personnel file. 
Progressive discipline ordinarily involves any or all of the following steps: [set forth in subsection (3) of this section.] When possible, a witness for the City will be in attendance. 
3.  Steps. 
a.  Oral counseling. The purpose of oral counseling is to allow the supervisor to bring to the employee's attention the need to improve his/her performance, work habits, behavior or attitude and to serve as a warning against further repetition of the unsatisfactory conduct. The supervisor should utilize the occasion to identify and define the area needing improvement and inform the employee as to how such improvement can be achieved. Documentation of the oral counseling will be made a part of the employee's personnel file. After an oral counseling has been in an employee's personnel file for nine (9) months, the respective document shall not be used in progressive discipline against the employee. However, the respective document shall continue to be utilized for performance appraisals. 
b.  Written reprimand. In situations where an oral counseling has not resulted in the expected improvement, or when an employee commits a more serious offense (Group II offense), a written reprimand will be issued to the employee. Documentation should be reviewed by Human Resources prior to issuance. After a written reprimand has been in an employee's personnel file for twelve (12) months, the respective document shall not be used in progressive discipline against the employee. However, the respective document shall continue to be utilized for performance appraisals. 
This shall include a complete description of the incident(s) or problem, and refer to specific times, dates, locations, personnel involved and rules violated. The employee will be notified that further problems may result in more severe corrective action up to and including discharge. 
c.  Suspension (disciplinary). In the event problems or offenses continue and the employee has already received oral or written reprimands, or if the nature of the problem is more serious in nature, an employee may be suspended for a specific period of time. After suspension has been in an employee's personnel file for thirty-six (36) months, the respective document shall not be used in progressive discipline against the employee. However, the respective document shall continue to be utilized for performance appraisals. 
Such suspension shall be without pay and, if for more than one day, shall be issued on a consecutive working day basis unless otherwise designated by the City Manager. A suspended employee may not be permitted to work on his/her normal day(s) off, nor take paid leave time, nor make up the time by working overtime in lieu of a payroll deduction for the period of suspension. 
d.  Demotion/termination. In those situations where the progressive disciplinary steps have not resulted in modification of the identified behavior, or where the employee commits a serious infraction (Group III offense), the employee may be demoted or terminated from employment with the city. 
4.  Suspension pending investigation of misconduct. 
a.  Conduct on duty. An employee may be suspended when his/her inappropriate behavior is so serious that immediate removal from the work place is necessary. The employee shall be required to leave city property pending investigation and the period of suspension shall be without pay. A suspended employee may not be permitted to work on his/her normal day(s) off, nor take paid leave time, nor make up the time by working overtime in lieu of a payroll deduction for the period of suspension. Some examples would be theft, insubordination, and threat of violent action, destruction of city property, reporting to work under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, or violations of the chain of command. When an investigation has been completed, the appropriate disciplinary step, if any, will be applied. If charges are not sustained, then employee shall be made whole. 
b.  Illegal conduct on or off-duty. Employees who are arrested and/or charged with serious criminal offenses (first-degree misdemeanor or felony) may be placed on suspension without pay where the presence of the Employee at work constitutes a hazard or creates potential liability, either to the City, to other Employees, or the Employee. A suspended employee may not be permitted to work on his/her normal day(s) off, nor take paid leave time, nor make up the time by working overtime in lieu of a payroll deduction for the period of suspension. 
Depending upon the results of the city's investigation, agreements through the state attorney's office such as pretrial intervention, or any adjudication by the court, the employee may then be disciplined up to and including discharge or the department head in consultation with the Director of Human Resources may take other appropriate disciplinary steps as he/she deems necessary. 
5.  Positive discipline/decision making. Any discipline/corrective action (other than oral counseling and termination) shall also include a decision-making review/commitment. The department head, or appropriate supervisory official designated by the department head, shall discuss the conduct, attendance, or work performance problem in a private meeting with the employee. An attempt should be made to reach an agreement regarding the nature of the problem, as well as a course of action to correct the situation. The department head, or designee, shall remind the employee of the commitment to follow work rules and city standards. The department head, or designee, shall discuss with the employee the implications of his/her action to him/herself, fellow workers, the department, the city and its residents. In this problem-solving discussion, the department head, or designee, is to help the employee recognize that a problem exists and to develop effective solutions. A commitment should be secured indicating the employee's understanding and willingness to adhere to the rules and city standards and that the conduct, attendance, or work performance problem that occurred will not be repeated the commitment should also reflect that the employee understands the concerns expressed. The commitment shall be reduced to writing, signed by both parties and placed in the employee's personnel file. Failure to secure a commitment should also be noted in the employee's personnel file. 
6.  Levels of offenses. The types of offenses requiring corrective action are divided into three Groups to reflect degrees of severity. In each Group and for each offense, such factors as the cost involved, the time interval between violations, the length and quality of service records and ability of the employee concerned will be considered. In each case where the penalty is modified from the recommended standard penalties, the reasons for such modifications will be noted in writing. 
The offenses listed under each of the three categories are examples only and are not intended to be all-inclusive. The city retains the right to treat each violation on an individual basis without setting a binding precedent for future cases. 
Failure of a supervisor to take an authorized corrective action does not bar or waive any authorized action for subsequent offenses. 
Any offense not specifically enumerated in the three Groups shall be considered an offense most closely resembling the Group listed and appropriate recommended guidelines will apply. 
As used in this section, the terms second or third offense do not necessarily mean a repeat of a previous offense in a particular Group, but include any and all offenses listed in any and all Groups of offenses. 
Group I Offenses Recommended Action First Offense Oral Counseling Second Offense Written Warning Third Offense Suspension-up to 10 days Fourth Offense Demotion/Termination

(3)  In the discretion of the commission, each or any issue of such revenue certificates may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the commission and a corporate trustee which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust agreement may pledge or assign the revenues to be received by the commission. The resolution providing for the issuance of revenue certificates or such trust agreement may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the certificate holders as may be reasonable, proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the commission in relation to the acquisition, construction, improvements, maintenance, operation, repair, equipping and insurance of the facilities, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the commission. Such resolution or such trust agreement may restrict the individual right of action by certificate holders as is customary in trust agreements securing bonds or debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such resolution or trust agreement may contain such other provisions as the commission may deem reasonable and proper for the security of certificate holders. Except as this chapter otherwise provides, the commission may provide, by resolution or by trust agreement, for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the revenue certificates and the revenues of the utilities and services to such officer, board or depository as it may determine for the custody thereof and for the method of disbursement thereof with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust agreement may be treated as a part of the cost of operation of the utilities affected by such trust agreement. 
(4)  The resolution or trust agreement providing for the issuance of the revenue certificates may also contain such limitations upon the issuance of additional revenue certificates as the commission may deem proper and such additional certificates shall be issued under such restrictions or limitations as may be prescribed by the resolution or trust agreement. 
Section 16. Refunding revenue certificates. 
    The commission , upon approval by ordinance of the city commission is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of refunding revenue certificates for the purpose of refunding any revenue certificates heretofore issued by the city of New Smyrna Beach then outstanding or issued under the provisions of this chapter. The commission is further authorized , upon approval by ordinance of the city commission, to provide by resolution for the issuance of revenue certificates for the combined purpose of: 
(1)  Paying the cost of any acquisition, construction, extension, addition, improving, equipping or reconstruction of a facility or facilities of the commission; 
(2)  Refunding revenue certificates heretofore issued by the city of New Smyrna Beach and of the commission which shall theretofore have been issued under the provisions of this chapter and shall then be outstanding. 
    The issuance of such obligations, the maturities and other details thereof, the rights and remedies of the holders thereof, the rights, powers, privileges, duties and obligations of the commission with respect to the same shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this chapter insofar as the same may be applicable. The city commission shall not withhold its approval or deny passage of an ordinance where such a withholding or denial would cause the commission to violate any of the covenants or terms of its bond resolutions and related contracts, resolutions and documents. 
Section 17. Legal status of revenue certificates or other obligations. 
    Any revenue certificates or other obligations issued pursuant to this chapter shall be and constitute legal investments for bonds, savings banks, trustees, executors, administrators and all other fiduciaries for all state, municipal and public funds and shall also be and constitute securities eligible for deposit as security for all state, municipal or other public funds notwithstanding the provisions of any other law or laws to the contrary. 
Section 18. 
    If any provision of this act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the act which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this act are declared severable. 
    Section 2. This act shall take effect upon becoming a law. 
Became a law without the Governor's approval. 
Filed in Office Secretary of State June 12, 1985.
