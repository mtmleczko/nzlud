PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Portage, Indiana. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1985 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the common council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1985 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and Ronald McLaughlin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Felix C. Kimbrough, City Clerk-Treasurer, and Mr. Gregory A. Sobkowski, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ________ through _____," inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code; and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-18. - Ordinance enforcement. 
    Department heads of the park department and planning department, or their duly authorized and designated representatives, shall be authorized to enforce ordinances affecting their departments. Before a representative designated by a department head shall be authorized to enforce ordinances, that representative shall undergo a background check and successfully complete a training program designed by the City of Portage Police Department.

    Failure to comply with the provisions of this division shall result in denial of a building permit. If the violation is discovered after the issuance of the building permit, the building permit may be revoked and/or the occupancy permit withheld. If a violation is discovered after issuance of the occupancy permit, the violator may be fined pursuant to section 1-16. Each day a building or structure, or portion thereof, constructed or erected after the effective date of this division, creates such interference shall constitute a separate violation. 
(Ord. No. 14-15, § 1, 12-2-14) 
Sec. 14-116. - Nuisance. 
    Violation of this division constitutes a nuisance because it threatens the health, safety, and welfare of the residents and visitors to the city. In addition to any other remedies or enforcement procedures provided herein, the city may seek an injunction to restrain such a nuisance. 
(Ord. No. 14-15, § 1, 12-2-14) 
Sec. 14-117. - Review procedure. 
(a)  Any person or entity intending to construct or erect a structure within the city that is higher than 50 feet tall shall contact the fire department and/or police department to review the proposed structure. 
(b)  The fire department and/or police department shall provide an applicant with a determination whether a proposed structure will interfere with the city's public safety, law enforcement, or other emergency-related telecommunications networks within 30 days of the date a complete application for such a determination is submitted. 
(c)  If the fire department and/or police department determine that interference will result from the erection or construction of the proposed structure, the structure may still be erected or constructed without violating this division if the following conditions are met: 
(1)  General. Except as otherwise provided, the erection, construction, or change in the use of any building or structure, or any part thereof, shall support adequate radio coverage for the city's radio communications system, including but not limited to firefighters and police officers. For purposes of this division, adequate radio coverage shall include all of the following: 
a.  A minimum signal strength of -95 dBm available in 90 percent of the area of each floor of the building when transmitted from the closest city radio communications system site; 
b.  A minimum signal strength of -95 dBm received at the closest city radio communications system site when transmitted from 90 percent of the area of each floor of the building; 
c.  A frequency range of 760 to 860 MHz. 
(2)  In-building radio system. Buildings and structures which do not provide adequate radio coverage shall be equipped with at least one of the following: (1) a radiating cable system or (2) an internal distributed antenna system ("DAS") with or without FCC certificated bi-directional 800 MHz amplifiers as needed. If any part of the installed system or systems contains an electrically-powered component, the system shall be capable of operating on an independent battery and/or generator system for a period of at least 12 hours without external power input. The battery system shall automatically charge in the presence of an external power input. 
(3)  Testing procedures. 
a.  Acceptance test procedure. When an in-building radio system is required, and upon completion of installation, it will be the building owner's responsibility to have the radio system tested to ensure adequate radio coverage, as defined above. 
Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of approximately 20 equal areas. In the event that three or more of the areas fail to provide two-way signal strength of at least -95 dBm, the building owner must have the system altered to meet the 90 percent coverage requirement. 
The test shall be conducted using a current police or fire department radio, or equivalent, talking through the city's radio communications system as specified by the police or fire department. A spot located approximately in the center of a grid area will be selected for the test. Once the spot has been selected, prospecting for a better spot within the grid area will not be permitted. Then the radio will be keyed to verify two-way communications between the building and the city radio communications system. 
The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified each year during the annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the building owner will be required to rerun the acceptance test to re-establish the gain values. 
b.  Annual tests. When an in-building radio system is required, it shall be the building owner's responsibility to have all active components of the system, such as amplifiers, power supplies and backup batteries tested a minimum of once every 12 months. The annual tests shall be performed by a member of the city's fire department. The building owner shall contact the fire department to schedule the annual tests. Amplifiers shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance. Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load of a period of one hour to verify that they will properly operate during an actual power outage. If within the one hour test period, and in the opinion of the testing technician, the battery exhibits symptoms of failure, the test shall be extended for additional one hour periods until the integrity of the battery can be determined. All other active components shall be checked to determine that they are operating within the manufacturer's specifications for the intended purpose. 
c.  Five-year tests. In addition to the annual test, it shall be the building owner's responsibility to perform a radio coverage test a minimum of once every five years to ensure that the radio system continues to meet the requirements of the original acceptance test. 
d.  Qualifications of testing personnel. Personnel conducting radio system tests shall be qualified to perform the work. All tests shall be documented and signed by a person in possession of a current FCC license, or a current technician certification issued by the Associated Public-Safety Communications Officials International (APCO) or the National Association of Business and Education Radio (NABER). All test records shall be retained on the inspected premises by the building owner and a copy submitted to the fire department officials. 
(Ord. No. 14-15, § 1, 12-2-14) 
Sec. 14-118. - Field testing. 
    Police and fire personnel, after providing reasonable notice to the owner or his/her representative, shall have the right to enter onto the property to conduct field testing to be certain that adequate radio coverage is present. 
(Ord. No. 14-15, § 1, 12-2-14) 
Sec. 14-119. - Exemptions. 
    This division shall not apply to one- or two-story residential complexes or elevators. However, this division shall apply to parking structures, stairwells, and stair shafts. 
(Ord. No. 14-15, § 1, 12-2-14) 
Sec. 14-120. - Appeal. 
    A person or entity who believes this division imposes an unreasonable financial burden on them may appeal the application of the division to the board of public works and safety. The board of public works and safety shall hear the appeal at a regularly scheduled meeting no later than 30 days after receipt of a written notice of appeal from the affected party. The board of public works and safety shall make a decision on the appeal no later than 30 days after the hearing. The decision of the board of public works and safety shall be final.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 18-1. - Prevailing scale of wages. 
(a)  Any person which is given approval by the common council for projects to be funded or benefited totally or in part by industrial revenue bonds, economic revitalization designation (tax abatement), urban development action grants, or any future economic development incentive shall be required to pay for each class of work on the project a scale of wages which shall in no case be less than the prevailing scale of wages being paid in the county for such class of work. 
(b)  It shall be considered unlawful for any contractor or subcontractor to make payment of wages for skilled, semiskilled or unskilled labor on any project which are less than the minimum provided for in the applicable national code of fair competition or regional agreement approval by the President of the United States. 
(c)  It shall be required that any contractor or subcontractor performing work shall file a schedule of the wages to be paid to such laborer, worker or mechanic with the clerk-treasurer's office. The schedule shall be filed before any work is performed. The schedule shall not be less than the prevailing scale of wages being paid in the county for such class of work. There is nothing, however, which shall prevent any contractor or subcontractor from paying a higher rate of wages than set out in the schedule of wages filed by him. 
(d)  A contractor or subcontractor who knowingly or willfully fails to pay the rate of wages determined under this section commits an ordinance violation and shall be fined not less than $1,000.00 nor more than $2,500.00 for each violation for each day it is allowed to continue. 
(Ord. No. 92-26, § 1, 7-7-92) 
Sec. 18-2. - Responsible bidding practices and submission requirements for submitting bids to perform construction work on public works projects. 
(a)  Bid submission requirements. Contractors proposing to submit bids on any city project estimated to cost at least $150,000.00 or more must submit with their bid a statement made under oath and subject to perjury laws, on a form designated by the city and which includes: 
(1)  A copy of a print-out of the Indiana Secretary of State's on-line records for the bidder dated within 60 days of the submission of said document showing that the bidder is in existence, current with the Indiana Secretary of State's Business Entity Reports, and eligible for a certificate of good standing. If the bidder is an individual, sole proprietor or partnership, this subsection shall not apply. 
(2)  A list identifying all former business names. 
(3)  Any determinations by a court or governmental agency for violations of federal, state, or local laws including, but not limited to violations of contracting or antitrust laws, tax or licensing laws, environmental laws, the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), or federal Davis-Bacon and related Acts. 
(4)  A statement on staffing capabilities, including labor sources. 
(5)  Evidence of participation in apprenticeship and training programs, applicable to the work to be performed on the project, which are approved by and registered with the United States Department of Labor's Office of Apprenticeship, or its successor organization. The required evidence includes a copy of all applicable apprenticeship certificates or standards for these training programs. 
(6)  A copy of a written plan for employee drug testing that: (i) covers all employees of the bidder who will perform work on the public work project; and (ii) meets, or exceeds, the requirements set forth in IC 4-13-18-5 or IC 4-13-18-6. 
(7)  The name and description of the management experience of each of the bidder's project managers and superintendents that bidder intends to assign to work on the project. 
(8)  Proof of any professional or trade license required by law for any trade or specialty area in which bidder is seeking a contract award; and disclosure of any suspension or revocation within the previous five years of any professional or trade license held by the company or of any director, office or manager employed by the bidder. 
(9)  Evidence that the contractor is utilizing a surety company which is on the United States Department of Treasury's Listing of Approved Sureties. 
(10)  A written statement of any federal, state or local tax liens or tax delinquencies owed to any federal, state or local taxing body in the last five years. 
    The city reserves the right to demand supplemental information from the bidder, additional verification of any of the information provided by the bidder, and to conduct random inquiries of the bidder's current and prior customers. 
(b)  Post-bid submissions from subcontractors. All bidders shall provide a written list that discloses the name, address, and type of work for each first-tier subcontractor from whom the bidder has accepted a bid and/or intends to hire on any part of the public work project, including individuals performing work as independent contractors, within five business days after the date the bids are due. 
    In addition, each such first-tier subcontractor shall be required to adhere to the requirements of subsection (a) of this section as though it were bidding directly to the city, except that first-tier subcontractors shall submit the required information (including the name, address, and type of work for each of their first-tier subcontractors) to the successful bidder no later than five business days after the subcontractor's first day of work on the public work project and the bidder shall then forward said information to the city. Payment shall be withheld from any first-tier subcontractor who fails to timely submit said information until such information is submitted and approved by the city. 
    Upon request, the city may require any second and lower-tier subcontractors to provide the required information (including name, address, type of work on the project and the name of the higher-tier subcontractor). Payments shall be withheld from any second or lower-tiered contractor who fails to timely submit this information until this information is submitted and approved by the city. 
    Additionally, the city may require the successful bidder and relevant subcontractor to remove the second or lower-tier subcontractor from the project and replace it with a responsive and responsible subcontractor. 
    Failure of a subcontractor to submit the required information shall not disqualify the successful bidder from performing work on the project and shall not constitute a contractual default and/or breach by the successful bidder. However, the city may withhold all payments otherwise due for work performed by a subcontractor, until the subcontractor submits the required information and the city approves such information. The city may also require the successful bidder to remove a subcontractor from the project and replace it with a responsive and responsible subcontractor. 
    The disclosure of a subcontractor ("Disclosed Subcontractor") by a bidder or a subcontractor shall not create any rights in the Disclosed Subcontractor. Thus, a bidder and/or subcontractor may substitute another subcontractor ("Substitute Subcontractor") for a Disclosed Subcontractor by giving the city written notice of the name, address, and type of work of the Substitute Subcontractor. The Substitute Subcontractor is subject to all of the obligations of a subcontractor under this section. 
(c)  Validity of pre-qualification classification. Upon designation by the city that a contractor's or subcontractor's submission required by this section is complete and timely, and upon any further consideration deemed necessary by the city, the contractor or subcontractor may be pre-qualified for future city public works projects. A contractor's classification as "qualified" shall exempt the contractor or sub-contractor from the comprehensive submission requirements contained herein for a period of 12 months. Thereafter, contractors or subcontractors who are pre-qualified must submit a complete application for continuation of "pre-qualified" standing, on a form provided by the city, (also referred to as the "short form") by December 31 st for the upcoming calendar year. Failure by any pre-qualified contractor or subcontractor to timely submit its complete application for continuation of "pre-qualified" standing shall result in automatic removal of the designation, effective January 1 of the upcoming year. However, the "removed" contractor or subcontractor shall still be permitted to bid on city public works projects. 
    Any material changes to the contractor's status, at any time, must be reported in writing within ten days of its occurrence to the city. The pre-qualification designation is solely within the discretion of the city and the city specifically reserves the right to change or revoke the designation for a stated written reason(s). 
    Denial of pre-qualification shall be in writing and shall be forwarded to the contractor within seven working days of such decision. Any contractor denied or losing pre-qualification status may request reconsideration of the decision by submitting such request in writing to the city within five business days of receipt of notice of denial. 
(d)  Incomplete submissions by bidders. It is the sole responsibility of the potential bidder to comply with all submission requirements applicable to the bidder in subsection (a) above by no later than the public bid opening. Post-bid submissions must be submitted in accordance with subsection (b) above. Submissions deemed inadequate, incomplete, or untimely by the city may result in the automatic disqualification of the bid. 
(e)  Responsive and responsible bidder determination. The city, after review of complete and timely submissions, shall, in its sole discretion, after taking into account all information in the submission requirements, determine whether a bidder is responsive and responsible. The city specifically reserves the right to utilize all information provided in the contractor or subcontractor's submission or any information obtained by the city through its own independent verification of the information provided by the contractor. 
(f)  Certified payroll. For projects in which the cost is at least $250,000.00, the successful bidder and all subcontractors working on a public work project shall submit a certified payroll report utilizing the federal form now known as a WH-347 which must be prepared on a weekly basis and submitted to the city within ten calendar days after the end of each week in which the bidder or subcontractor performed its work on the public work project. These certified payroll reports shall identify the job title and craft of each employee on the project, e.g., journeyman electrician or apprentice electrician. 
    The city may withhold payment due for work performed by a bidder if the bidder fails to timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time as such certified payroll reports are submitted. The city may also withhold payment due for work performed by a subcontractor if the subcontractor fails to timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time as such certified payroll reports are submitted. The city shall not withhold payment to a bidder for work performed by the bidder or for work performed by subcontractors who have submitted their certified payroll reports, because one or more other subcontractors failed to timely submit their certified payroll reports. 
(g)  Public records. All information submitted by a bidder or a subcontractor pursuant to this section, including certified payrolls, are public records subject to review pursuant to the Indiana Access to Public Records law (IC 5-14-3). 
(h)  Penalties for false, deceptive or fraudulent statements/information. Any bidder that makes, or causes to be made, a false, deceptive or fraudulent statement, or submits false, deceptive or fraudulent information in connection with any submission made to the city shall be disqualified from bidding on all city projects for a period of three years and may be fined a maximum of $5,000.00.

If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or other watercourses, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(b)  Termination due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this division may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would, in the judgment of Portage, abate or reduce an illicit discharge. Portage will notify the violator of the proposed termination of their MS4 access. The violator may petition Portage for a post-termination hearing regarding the termination of access. Such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with rules promulgated by Portage. A person commits a violation of this division if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of Portage. 
(Ord. No. 07-13, § 1, 5-1-07) 
Sec. 42-191. - Industrial or construction activity discharges. 
    Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to Portage prior to or as a condition of a subdivision map, site plan, building permit, or development or improvement plan; upon inspection of the facility; during any enforcement proceeding or action; or for any other reasonable cause. 
(Ord. No. 07-13, § 1, 5-1-07) 
Sec. 42-192. - Access and inspection of properties and facilities. 
    Whenever Portage has cause to believe that there exists, or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which constitutes a violation of this division, Portage or its agent shall have the right to enter the premises at any reasonable time to determine if the discharger is complying with all requirements of this division. Portage or its agent shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this division as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this division. If the facility has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the person in control of such premises shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of Portage. In the event that the owner or occupant refuses entry after a request to enter has been made, Portage is hereby empowered to seek assistance from a court of competent jurisdiction in obtaining such entry. If a discharge is observed which represents an immediate hazard to public health or safety, or aquatic life, Portage, a department of law enforcement, a department of fire and rescue services, and any other agent of Portage, may enter any property or structure, except a dwelling, as necessary to prevent or stop the hazard. 
    Portage shall have the right to set up on the property of any discharger to the MS4 such devices that are necessary to conduct an investigation of such discharges. The investigation may include, but is not limited to the following: sampling of any discharge and/or process waters, the taking of photographs, interviewing staff on alleged violations, and access to any and all facilities or areas within the premises that may have any effect on the discharge. 
(Ord. No. 07-13, § 1, 5-1-07) 
Sec. 42-193. - Requirement to remediate. 
    Whenever Portage finds a discharge of pollutants is taking place or has occurred which will result in or has resulted in pollution of stormwater, the storm drain system, or other watercourses, Portage may require by written notice to the owner of the property and/or the responsible person that the pollution be remediated and the affected property restored within a specified time pursuant to the provisions of section 42-197. 
(Ord. No. 07-13, § 1, 5-1-07) 
Sec. 42-194. - Requirement to monitor and analyze. 
    Portage may require by written notice of requirement that any person engaged in any activity and/or owning or operating any facility which may cause or contribute to stormwater pollution, illegal discharges, and/or non-stormwater discharges to the storm drain system or other watercourses, to undertake at said person's expense such monitoring and analyses and furnish such reports to Portage as deemed necessary to determine compliance with this division. 
(Ord. No. 07-13, § 1, 5-1-07) 
Sec. 42-195. - Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices. 
    Portage has adopted requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to the pollution or contamination of stormwater, the municipal separate storm sewer system, or other watercourses. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for premises, which are, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWP3) or stormwater management plan (SWMP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(Ord. No. 07-13, § 1, 5-1-07) 
Sec. 42-196. - Notification of spills. 
    Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for any premises, facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the municipal separate storm sewer system, or other watercourses, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify Portage or its appointed agent in person or by phone no later than 24 hours. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to Portage at: 
City of Portage Department of Public Works 
6070 Central Avenue 
Portage, IN 46368 
within five calendar days of the phone or in-person notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years. 
(Ord. No. 07-13, § 1, 5-1-07) 
Sec. 42-197. - Violations, enforcement and penalties. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this division. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this division shall be subject to one or more of the enforcement actions outlined in this section. Any violation or threatened violation may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law. 
    In the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, Portage or its appointed agent is authorized to enter upon the subject private property, without giving prior notice, to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. Portage or its appointed agent is authorized to seek costs of abatement as outlined in subsection (e). 
(a)  Compliance directive. In addition to any other remedy available to Portage, inspectors may issue compliance directives at the time of inspection to require a person to implement actions that will correct any violation of this division. 
(b)  Notice of violation. Whenever Portage finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this division, Portage may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation: 
1.  The performance of monitoring, analysis, and reporting; 
2.  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 
3.  That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist; 
4.  The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; and 
5.  Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and 
6.  The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. 
If abatement of a violation or the restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to complete the remediation or restoration within the established deadline, the work may be done by Portage or its designee and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator. 
(c)  Appeal of notice of violation. Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of Portage. The notice of appeal must be received within ten days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the board or its designee shall take place within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the board or their designee shall be final. 
(d)  Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within ten days of the decision of the board, then representatives of Portage and its designees are authorized to enter upon the subject property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and restore the affected property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the representatives or designees of Portage to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. 
(e)  Cost of abatement of the violation. If Portage abates a violation, then within 15 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. Such notice shall be given by personal delivery or by mail to the last known address of the owner as shown in the records of the county assessor. Such notice shall be effective upon the date of mailing or personal delivery. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within ten days of the effective date of the notice. If no protest is filed, then the charges shall become due and payable on the date set forth in the notice, which date shall be after the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, and such charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. In the event a protest is filed, a hearing on such protest shall be held before the appropriate authority or its designee within 15 days from the date of receipt of the written protest. If any charges are upheld upon completion of such hearing, then such charges shall become due and payable ten days after the issuance of the order upon such protest and if not timely paid, such charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. Such charges may also be recovered in a civil against the owner or other person in control of the premises for which such charges were incurred, and any person violating any of the provisions of this division shall be liable to Portage for all costs, fees, charges and expenses, including but not limited to administrative costs and legal fees and costs, by reason of such violation. 
(f)  Civil penalties. In the event the alleged violator fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within ten days, or such greater period as Portage shall deem appropriate, after Portage has taken one or more of the actions described above, Portage may impose a penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 (depending on the severity of the violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after the receipt of the notice of violation. 
(g)  Criminal penalties; enforcement costs. Any person who violates any provision of this division shall be liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest extent of the law, and shall be subject to a criminal penalty of $1,000 dollars per violation per day. 
Portage may recover all attorneys' fees, court costs and other ordinance expenses associated with enforcement of this division, including sampling and monitoring expenses. 
(h)  Injunctive relief. Portage may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining any person from undertaking any activities which would result in a violation or continued violation of this division, and may seek mandatory injunctive relief compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of any violation of this division. 
(i)  Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this division, Portage at its option may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc. 
(j)  Violations deemed a public nuisance. In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided herein, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this division is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense, or maybe subject of a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance. 
(k)  Remedies not exclusive. Except as expressly provided above, the remedies in this section are cumulative and the exercise of any one or more remedies shall not prejudice any other remedies that may otherwise be pursued for a violation of this division. The remedies listed in this division are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the discretion of Portage to seek cumulative remedies.

Secs. 42-198-42-207. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 6. - DEVELOPMENT IN FLOOD HAZARD AREAS[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 15-10, § 1, adopted Sept. 1, 2015, repealed the former Div. 6, §§ 42-208-42-236, and enacted a new Div. 6 as set out herein. The former Div. 6 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 07-14, § 1, 5-1-07; Ord. No. 09-85, § 1, 11-17-09. 

Sec. 42-208. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common Council of the City of Portage does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(b)  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Portage are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this division to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities. 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage. 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(6)  Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(d)  Objectives. The objectives of this division are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health. 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects. 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions. 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains. 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas. 
(Ord. No. 15-10, § 1, 9-1-15) 
Sec. 42-209. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this division shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this division its most reasonable application. 
    A zone means portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as zone A, zone AE, zones A1-A30, zone AO, zone AH, zone AR and zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented below: 
Zone A: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent-annual-chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown. 
Zone AE and A1-A30: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent-annual-chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.) 
Zone AO: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. 
Zone AH: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. 
Zone AR: Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection. 
Zone A99: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent-annual-chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure with a floor area 400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
    Addition (to an existing structure) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this division. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation of the one-percent-annual-chance flood. 
    Basement means that portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Boundary river means the part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between Kentucky and Indiana. 
    Boundary river floodway means the floodway of a boundary river. 
    Building. See "structure." 
    Community means a political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction. 
    Community rating system (CRS) means a program developed by the Federal Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding. 
    Critical facility means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste. 
    D Zone means unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in this zone. 
    Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including but not limited to: 
(1)  Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any addition to a structure; 
(2)  Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than 180 days; 
(3)  Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction of roads, or similar projects; 
(4)  Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes, dams, channel improvements, etc.; 
(5)  Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling operations; 
(6)  Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts; 
(7)  Storage of materials; or 
(8)  Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface waters. 
    "Development" does not include activities such as the maintenance of existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent structures. 
    Elevated structure means a non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or columns (posts and piers). 
    Elevation certificate is a certified statement that verifies a structure's elevation information. 
    Emergency program means the first phase under which a community participates in the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    FEMA means the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
    Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM) means an official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) is the official hydraulic and hydrologic report provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM (where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Flood prone area means any land area acknowledged by a community as being susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See "Flood") 
    Flood protection grade (FPG) is the elevation of the regulatory flood plus two feet at any given location in the SFHA. (see "Freeboard") 
    Floodplain means the channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe districts. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this division and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management requirements. 
    Floodproofing (dry floodproofing) is a method of protecting a structure that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact forces. 
    Floodproofing certificate is a form used to certify compliance for non-residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or architect. 
    Floodway is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or stream. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than those calculated for the base flood. 
    Fringe is those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway. 
    Hardship (as related to variances of this division) means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City of Portage board of zoning appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structures means any structures individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures. 
    Increased cost of compliance (ICC) means the cost to repair a substantially damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage. 
    Letter of final determination (LFD) means a letter issued by FEMA during the mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously incorporated an automatic adoption clause. 
    Letter of map change (LOMC) is a general term used to refer to the several types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter. They include letter of map amendment (LOMA), letter of map revision (LOMR), and letter of map revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are presented below: 
    Letter of map amendment (LOMA) means an amendment by letter to the currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA. 
    Letter of map revision (LOMR) means an official revision to the currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations, and elevations. 
    Letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) means an official revision by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the BFE and excluded from the SFHA. 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the lowest elevation, after completion of construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest elevation described among the following: 
(1)  The top of the lowest level of the structure. 
(2)  The top of the basement floor. 
(3)  The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of the structure. 
(4)  The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars. 
(5)  The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance to the flow of flood waters unless: 
a.  The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area, each shall have openings on exterior walls; 
b.  The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and, 
c.  Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of vehicles and building access. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Market value means the building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or adjusted assessed values. 
    Mitigation means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of disaster response and recovery. 
    National flood insurance program (NFIP) is the federal program that makes flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the private insurance industry. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced after the effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance. 
    Non-boundary river floodway means the floodway of any river or stream other than a boundary river. 
    North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) as adopted in 1993 is a vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    Obstruction includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    One-percent-annual-chance flood is the flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the one-percent-annual chance flood. See "regulatory flood". 
    Physical map revision (PMR) is an official republication of a community's FEMA map to effect changes to base (one-percent annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs. 
    Public safety and nuisance means anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis; (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regular program means the phase of the community's participation in the NFIP where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations determined in a FIS. 
    Regulatory flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is as defined in subsection 42-210(b) of this division. The "regulatory flood" is also known by the term "base flood", "one-percent-annual-chance flood", and "100-year flood". 
    Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Section 1316 is that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that the administrator finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means those lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Portage subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the City of Portage are generally identified as such on the Porter County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated September 30, 2015 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as zone A, AE, Al-A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO). 
    Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Suspension means the removal of a participating community from the NFIP because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management regulations required for participation in the NFIP. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this division, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this division where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this division. A structure or other development without the elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in this division is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
    X zone means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less than 0.2 percent. 
    Zone means a geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area. 
    Zone A (see definition for A zone) 
    Zone B, C, and X means areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of zones B and C.) 
(Ord. No. 15-10, § 1, 9-1-15) 
Sec. 42-210. - General provisions. 
(a)  Lands to which this division applies. This division shall apply to all SFHAs and known flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Portage. 
(b)  Basis for establishing regulatory flood data. This division's protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory flood data is listed below. 
(1)  The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of Portage shall be as delineated on the one-percent-annual-chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Porter County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas dated September 30, 2015 and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map dated September 30, 2015 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. 
(2)  The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of Portage, delineated as an "A zone" on the Porter County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated September 30, 2015 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and subsequently approved. 
(3)  In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. 
(4)  Upon issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD), any more restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA. 
(c)  Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this division prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of special flood hazard. 
(d)  Compliance. No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this division and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of this division and other applicable regulations. 
(e)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. The ordinance from which this division derives is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this division and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(f)  Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations. 
(1)  In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the profiles shall govern. 
(2)  If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly. 
(3)  If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA. 
(g)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this division all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements. 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body. 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(h)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this division is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this division does not create any liability on the part of the City of Portage, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this division or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. 
(i)  Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain development permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this division. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code for the City of Portage. All violations shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $2,500.00 for a first violation and by a fine not exceeding $7,500.00 for a second or subsequent violation. 
(1)  A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation continues to exist. 
(2)  The City of Portage plan commission shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended. 
(3)  Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. 
(Ord. No. 15-10, § 1, 9-1-15)

(5)  All subdivision proposals shall minimize development in the SFHA and/or limit density of development permitted in the SFHA. 
(6)  All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into/out of SFHA for pedestrians and vehicles (especially emergency responders). 
(d)  Critical facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. 
(e)  Standards for identified floodways. Located within SFHAs, established in subsection 42-210(b), are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the floodplain administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving, etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of a non-substantial addition/ improvement to a residence in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.) 
    No action shall be taken by the floodplain administrator until a permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the floodplain administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in section 42-212 of this division have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence. 
    No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least 0.15 of one foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses. 
    For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12. 
(f)  Standards for identified fringe. If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the floodplain administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the provisions contained in section 42-212 of this division have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG. 
(g)  Standards for SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/fringes. 
(1)  Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile: 
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the floodplain administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment. 
No action shall be taken by the floodplain administrator until either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the one-percent-annual-chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. 
Once the floodplain administrator has received the proper permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in section 42-212 of this division have been met. 
(2)  Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile: 
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the floodplain administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodplain and one-percent annual chance flood elevation for the site. 
Upon receipt, the floodplain administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in section 42-212 of this division have been met. 
(3)  The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not increase flood damages or potential flood damages. 
(h)  Standards for flood prone areas. All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as required per section 42-212. 
(Ord. No. 15-10, § 1, 9-1-15) 
Sec. 42-213. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  Designation of variance and appeals board. The City of Portage Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from requirements of this division. 
(b)  Duties of variance and appeals board. The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this division. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board may appeal such decision to the Porter County Circuit or Superior Court. 
(c)  Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this division, and; 
(1)  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 
(2)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. 
(3)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
(4)  The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where applicable. 
(5)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage. 
(6)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development, 
(7)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area. 
(8)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
(9)  The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment of transport of the floodwaters at the site. 
(10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(d)  Conditions for variances. 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued when there is: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause. 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship. 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances. 
(2)  No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to subsection 42-212(e) or (g)(1) of this division may be granted. 
(3)  Any variance granted in a floodway subject to subsection 42-212(e) or (g)(1) of this division will require a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. 
(4)  Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of subsection 42-212(b), may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade. 
(5)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(6)  Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures. 
(7)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation (See subsection 42-213(e)). 
(8)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request (see subsection 42-213(e)). 
(e)  Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted that allows the lowest floor of a structure to be built below the flood protection grade shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the flood protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and; 
(2)  Such construction below the flood protection grade increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
    The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance. 
(f)  Historic structure. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(g)  Special conditions. Upon the consideration of the factors listed in section 42-213, and the purposes of this division, the board of zoning appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this division.

(a)  No person shall cause, suffer, or allow to be emitted into the outdoor atmosphere from any fuel-burning equipment or premises, or to pass a convenient measuring point near the stack outlet, particulate matter in the gases to exceed 0.60 pounds per 1,000,000 Btu heat input for installations using less than 10,000,000 Btu per hour total input. For a single unit using greater than 10,000,000 Btu per hour total input, the allowable particulate emission limitation will be determined from the following table: 
  Heat input in 
millions of British 
  thermal units 
   per hour Maximum allowable emission of particulate matter in pounds per million British thermal units per hour, heat input     10 or less ..... 0.60      50 ..... 0.46     100 ..... 0.41     500 ..... 0.32   1,000 ..... 0.29   2,500 ..... 0.25   5,000 ..... 0.225  7,500 ..... 0.210 10,000 or more ..... 0.20

The examination papers shall be kept under the commission's supervision. A member who is aggrieved with the score received on the written examination, may appeal to the commission for review of the score within ten days after receiving notice of the score.

ARTICLE III. - PARK AND RECREATION IMPACT FEE[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 14-1, adopted Jan. 14, 2014, did not specifically amend the Code and has been codified herein as superseding the former Art. III, §§ 58-55-58-70. Formerly, Art. III pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 06-68, §§ 1-16, adopted Dec. 12, 2006, and Ord. No. 07-36, §§ 1A and 1B, adopted July 3, 2007. 

Sec. 58-55. - Limitation on imposition of impact fee. 
    The impact fee may not be collected more than five years after the effective date of the ordinance as required by IC 36-7-4-1340, unless a replacement impact fee ordinance is adopted consistent with Indiana law. 
(Ord. No. 14-1, § 1, 1-14-14) 
Sec. 58-56. - Establishment of impact zone. 
    There is hereby established one infrastructure impact zone, the boundaries of which are co-terminus with the existing corporate boundaries of the city, as such boundaries may be extended from time to time through annexation, and over which boundaries the city exercises planning and zoning jurisdiction. In this regard, the city council specifically finds that there is a functional relationship between the components of the plan and that the park and recreational plan provides a reasonably uniform benefit to all citizens throughout the impact zone as of the adoption of this article. The city council further finds that all areas within the impact zone are contiguous as required by IC 36-7-4-1316. Except as provided herein, this article shall apply uniformly to all residential developments within the impact zone hereby established for which the city which (sic) require a structural building permit and which creates a need for new and additional park and recreational infrastructure. This article shall not apply to: 
(a)  Development meeting the requirements set forth in IC 36-7-4-1322(g); 
(b)  Improvements which do not require a building permit; 
(c)  Improvements which do not create a need for new and additional infrastructure, including the erection of a sign, construction of accessory buildings, structures or fences, or the alteration, renovation or expansion of an improvement where the use, or intensity thereof, has not changed; 
(d)  The replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed improvement provided that the replacement improvement does not create a need for new and additional infrastructure over and above the infrastructure needed by the original improvement prior to the destruction or partial destruction thereof; and 
(e)  Nonresidential development. 
(Ord. No. 14-1, § 2, 1-14-14) 
Sec. 58-57. - Zone improvement plan. 
    As a precondition to the adoption of this article, the city undertook a comprehensive and detailed park and recreational impact analysis through the employment for that purpose of Lehman & Lehman, Inc. The city council now finds that the resulting study and data base constitute a sufficient study to constitute a "zone improvement plan" as contemplated by IC 36-7-4-1318. The city council does hereby adopt the plan prepared by Lehman & Lehman, Inc., dated September, 2013, as its zone improvement plan and specifically finds that the zone improvement plan contains the following elements: 
(a)  Reasonable estimates relating to the nature and location of development that is expected to occur within the impact zone during the following ten-year period from the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived; 
(b)  A reasonable determination of the community level of service for the impact zone; 
(c)  A reasonable determination of the current level of service provided within the impact zone; 
(d)  A reasonable estimate of the nature, location, sequencing, and timing of the park and recreational requirements and costs necessary to provide the community level of service for the developments contemplated in subsection (a) hereof; 
(e)  A reasonable estimate of the share of the park and recreational costs identified in subsection (d) hereof that will be used: 
(1)  To raise the current level of service for existing development or provide service to existing development; or 
(2)  To provide service to new development. 
(f)  A reasonable estimate of revenues that: 
(1)  Are from sources other than impact fees; and 
(2)  Will be used to finance the cost identified in subsection (e)(1) above; 
(g)  A description of the nature and location of existing infrastructure in the impact zone. 
(h)  A general description of the sources and amounts of money used to pay for infrastructure during the previously five years. 
    Additionally the city council hereby adopts specifically the zone improvement plan as an official part of the comprehensive plan for the city, pursuant to IC 36-7-4-500 et seq. 
(Ord. No. 14-1, § 3, 1-14-14) 
Sec. 58-58. - Establishment of park and recreation impact fee. 
    Based on the plan, the city council determines that the park and recreation impact fee should be $697.00 per residential building permit. The city council hereby makes, as part of the record of these proceedings, all of the data collected, the calculations made, and the conclusions reached by Lehman & Lehman, Inc., in the process of developing and drafting the zone improvement plan, and specifically instructs the employees of the city to make such data and other information available to the public for review during regular business hours. 
    In the event any parcel of real estate subject to the zone improvement plan undergoes a change in use, redevelopment, or a modification, which change requires a building permit, and creates a need for new infrastructure, an impact fee will only be assessed for the increase in the burden on infrastructure. 
(Ord. No. 14-1, § 4, 1-14-14) 
Sec. 58-59. - Credit in lieu of payment; exemptions. 
    Any person obligated to pay a fee pursuant to the terms of this article may have the option of financing, constructing, and dedicating park and recreational infrastructure owned and operated by a neighborhood association for the public benefit, all as described and defined in the plan and the city park board policy resolution dated on the 16th day of September, 2013, instead of making all or part of any impact fee payment to the city, and in accordance with the park and recreational specifications for such park and recreational infrastructure to be improved in force within the city's jurisdiction at the time. The fee payer, or other person or entity providing the infrastructure or improvement, shall be given credit for the actual costs of planning, financing, and constructing such park and recreational infrastructure for the city. A request for credit shall be presented prior to the issuance of the building permit. In the event the actual cost of such planning, financing, and construction do not equal the amount of the impact fee pursuant to the calculation provided for the schedule set forth in section 58-58 of this article, the remaining balance shall be due in accordance with the provisions stated hereafter. 
    Credits against impact fees otherwise due shall be allowed pursuant to this section for all infrastructure improvements constructed or furnished in accordance with IC 36-7-4-1313 and IC 36-7-4-1335. In addition, a fee payer or other person or entity responsible for the installing infrastructure or improvements may designate in writing a method of allocating its credits to future fee payers who may be successors in interest to the credits earned by the fee payer or others, as part of the certification provided for above. Any person or entity otherwise obligated to pay the fee established by this article whose property was totally or partially destroyed by fire, storm, or other casualty beyond his/her/its control, shall be exempt from said fee is he/she/it repairs or replaces the destroyed structure without creating a burden on infrastructure greater than the burden imposed by the destroyed infrastructure. In the event of such additional burden, the fee shall be calculated based only on the increased burden created by the structure. 
(Ord. No. 14-1, § 5, 1-14-14) 
Sec. 58-60. - Impact fee due upon issuance of a building permit. 
    The fee imposed pursuant to the terms of this article shall be due and payable upon the issuance of a building permit by the city. It is understood that the term "building permit" is synonymous with the term "structural building permit" as that term is used in IC 36-7-4-1323, in that the issuance of a building permit authorizes the applicant to commence construction activities, structural or otherwise. The fee which is calculated pursuant to the terms of this article, which is a per dwelling unit fee, shall be due at said time unless the amount of the fee upon calculation is greater than $5,000.00, in which case an installment plan may be requested by the applicant in accordance with the terms set forth in IC 36-7-4-1324(a) through (d). The city impact fee review board shall establish specific rules consistent with said code provisions for installment payments. The interest rate on any installment plan or deferred payment shall be established by the Indiana Code, as from time to time amended. 
    If a fee payer requests, the amount of the fee shall be assessed upon the voluntary submission of a development plan or upon the issuance of the building permit, whichever is earlier. For purposes of this section, assessment means the act of calculating the amount of the fee which shall be due. The city shall make such assessment within 30 days of the date of such voluntary request or at the issuance of the building permit with or without the request. 
(Ord. No. 14-1, § 6, 1-14-14) 
Sec. 58-61. - Lien rights established. 
    Pursuant to IC 36-7-4-1325, the city acquires a lien against the real estate which is the subject of the fee on the date a building permit is issued. Upon adoption, this article shall be recorded, and thereafter, it shall constitute constructive notice of the lien rights of the city with respect to a parcel of real estate which is the subject of an installment payment of the fee. The city may, in its discretion, file a specific instrument setting forth its lien rights with respect to a parcel of real estate which is the subject of an installment payment of the fee, and such instrument shall constitute actual notice in addition to the constructive notice provided for by the recording of this article. 
(Ord. No. 14-1, § 7, 1-14-14) 
Sec. 58-62. - Form of receipt. 
    The city clerk-treasurer shall issue a receipt for any and all impact fees collected and the form of such receipt shall be as follows: 
Received of ______________ (fee payer) ______________________, this __________ day of ______________, the sum of $__________________ in (full) (partial) satisfaction of Recreational Impact Fees due pursuant to Portage City Council Ordinance No. 2014-___ relating to improvements to be constructed on the real estate located at and described on Exhibit A attached hereto and made part hereof, and subject to lien rights in favor of the City of Portage in the event of partial payment with payments remaining due.

One member shall be a real estate broker licensed in Indiana; 
One member shall be an engineer licensed in Indiana; and 
One member shall be a certified public accountant. 
A board member shall not be a member of the city advisory plan commission.

(c)  In the event any person appointed as a board member shall fail to qualify as provided within ten days after mailing to him/her of notice of his /her appointment, or if any member after qualifying shall die, resign, vacate office, or in the event a member is unable to hear a petition due to a conflict of interest, the mayor shall fill such vacancy with a new or temporary (in the event of a conflict of interest) member meeting the qualifications of the member being replaced. A new member shall serve out the remainder of the vacated term, while a temporary member shall serve for the period necessary to dispose of the petition giving rise to the conflict. 
(d)  The board shall be governed by IC 36-7-4-1338(c) and all other applicable provisions of the impact fee statute. 
(Ord. No. 14-1, § 9, 1-14-14) 
Sec. 58-64. - Appeals. 
    Any fee payer who believes itself to be aggrieved by the calculation of the fee may appeal from such calculation to the city impact fee review board and the city impact fee review board shall conduct a hearing with regard thereto. At such hearing, the fee payer shall bear the burden of going forward with the evidence and shall present evidence addressing either of the following propositions: 
(a)  A fact assumption used in determining the amount of the fee is incorrect; or 
(b)  The amount of the fee is greater than the amount allowed under IC 36-7-4-1320, 36-7-4-1321 and 36-7-4-1322. 
    Upon conclusion of the hearing at which the matter is first presented, or at the conclusion of the hearing if the matter is continued, the city impact fee review board shall determine the appropriate amount of the fee based upon the facts presented and may reverse, affirm, modify, or make such adjustments in the fee, as it believes are appropriate under the circumstances, if any, including establishing the amount of an impact fee, a credit, a refund, or any combination of fees, credit, or refunds. 
    The city impact fee review board shall make written findings of fact supporting its decision and shall provide a copy of its decision to the city council and the fee payer involved in the appeal within five days after making its decision. 
    An appeal under this section must be filed no later than 30 days after the issuance of the building permit.

    The city shall not deny the issuance of a building permit on the basis that the impact fee has not been paid, or condition issuance of the permit on the payment of the impact fee. If the impact fee totals $1,000.00 or less, the city may require the fee payer to pay the impact fee or initiate an appeal under this section before the building permit is issued. 
(Ord. No. 14-1, § 10, 1-14-14) 
Sec. 58-65. - Establishment of park and recreation impact fee fund. 
    There is hereby established the park and recreation impact fee fund of the city. This fund shall be a non-reverting fund and shall receive any and all sums collected pursuant to this article to be utilized in connection with the purposes set forth herein. The fund shall consist initially of one account based upon the current existence of one impact zone. In the event, and only in the event, that an additional impact zone is created hereafter, a separate account shall be maintained for each separate impact zone established within the city. Interest earned on the fund or on any account with the fund, shall be deposited and maintained within the fund or the separate account. The city clerk-treasurer shall maintain records of the status of the fund or any account which may be established therein, and shall make an annual report of the fund and accounts which shall be available to the public in general and fee payers, upon request. 
    Pursuant to IC 36-7-4-1332(e), the clerk-treasurer is designated as the city official responsible for acting on refund requests. In order to facilitate refunds when they may be due, the clerk-treasurer is directed to identify the purpose of any impact fee paid in order that a refund, if any, may be paid from the fund or account into which the fee was originally deposited. 
(Ord. No. 14-1, § 11, 1-14-14)

(Ord. No. 01-61, § 1, 11-6-01) 
Sec. 62-122. - Appropriate bargaining units. 
    The board shall, upon receipt of a valid petition for a representation election filed by a labor organization, designate the appropriate bargaining unit for collective bargaining. 
(Ord. No. 01-61, § 2, 11-6-01) 
Sec. 62-123. - Determination of representation. 
(a)  Any labor organization may file a written request with the board asserting that employees in a bargaining unit of the city desire to be represented by it for the purpose of collective bargaining and asking to be recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative. The request shall include a demonstration of support of at least 30 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit by means of a dated membership list or signed and dated membership cards of those employees desiring representation. Notice of the request shall be posted by the city in a place conspicuous to employees in the bargaining unit. 
(b)  Upon authentication of the list or cards, the board shall call and hold a representation election within 45 days from the date that the board determines the appropriateness of the bargaining unit. Such election shall not be held if: 
(1)  There is currently in effect a lawful written agreement between the city and an exclusive bargaining representative for the bargaining unit; 
(2)  Within the preceding 12 months, there has been held a representation election or a decertification election for the bargaining unit; or 
(3)  Voluntary recognition has been granted in the past 12 months. 
(c)  The board shall call and hold all elections within the time limits established by this section and according to the following: 
(1)  Included on the ballot in a representation election shall be any employee organization(s) submitting evidence of support of at least 30 percent of the city employees in the bargaining unit and a choice for no representation. The choices on a ballot in a decertification election shall be the incumbent exclusive bargaining representative, no representation and any employee organization(s) submitting evidence of support of at least 30 percent of the city employees in the bargaining unit; 
(2)  Voting shall be by secret ballot; 
(3)  Where a simple majority of the votes cast are in favor of representation by a labor organization and at least 60 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit have cast a vote, the board shall certify the labor organization as the exclusive representation for all employees in that appropriate bargaining unit. No labor organization shall be certified as an exclusive representative unless at least 60 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit vote in the election or run-off election. This subsection does not apply to decertification elections. In a decertification election, the labor organization must receive a simple majority of the votes cast in order to retain certification as representative of the employees in a bargaining unit. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)-(c) of this section, the employer is required to recognize as the exclusive representative of its employees within an appropriate unit, a labor organization which presents to the employer evidence of its representation of a simple majority of the employees within the unit, unless any other organization, employee, group of employees, or labor organization representing employees within the unit files written objections to recognition with the board. In the absence of such objections, the board is not required to hold a hearing or to direct an election. Before recognizing an exclusive representative under the circumstances of this subsection, the board is required to post a written public notice of its intention to recognize the organization as exclusive representative of the employees within the unit. The notice must be posted for at least 30 days immediately preceding recognition. In the event objections are filed, an election shall be conducted in accordance with this section. 
(e)  The certified exclusive bargaining representative shall represent all employees covered by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, whether or not the employees choose to join the union. 
(f)  The decertification of any employee organization which has been recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative of employees in an appropriate bargaining unit may be effected by the filing of a written request for decertification supported by a showing that 30 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit seek to have a decertification election. If, in the opinion of the board, the showing of interest in support of such a petition is sufficient, within 45 days, a decertification election shall be held. 
(g)  No decertification election shall be held if within the preceding 12 months, the board has held a representation election or decertification election for the bargaining unit. 
(h)  The following meetings shall be closed as defined by the open door law: 
(1)  Meetings for discussion of bargaining strategy for collective bargaining negotiations between the employer and the exclusive representative; and 
(2)  Collective bargaining sessions. 
(i)  A labor organization certified as the exclusive bargaining representative for employees prior to the effective date of this article shall be recognized without following the certification procedures set forth in this article. If such a labor organization is decertified, the provisions of the article shall apply to its recertification. 
(Ord. No. 01-61, § 3, 11-6-01)

(b)  In the case of an action by bargaining unit employees where the employer alleges a strike has occurred, the board shall meet in emergency session, within 24 hours of the disclosure of this information, and determine whether a strike has indeed occurred. 
(c)  The board, after determining that a strike has occurred, shall direct that the collective bargaining agreement ceases to exist, and shall declare that the exclusive representative no longer represents employees in the bargaining unit involved. The board shall notify the employees in the subject bargaining unit of such action and advise them that they will not be privileged to bargain with the city through a collective bargaining agent for at least 12 months. In such case, the exclusive representative that represented the employees who went on strike shall be prohibited from collecting dues through payroll deductions, negotiating or representing employees in any fashion and shall be barred from serving as the exclusive representative of any bargaining unit of employees for a minimum of 12 months, at which time the city shall negotiate a new agreement unless decertification has occurred. 
(d)  In the case of a violation of this section, the city may petition the appropriate court to: 
(1)  Issue an order restraining and enjoining such violation; 
(2)  In the case of a strike, walkout or slowdown, impose on the employee organization a fine which will be set in accordance with the damages, loss of revenue and/or services involved. 
(Ord. No. 01-61, § 5, 11-6-01) 
Sec. 62-126. - Agreements. 
    Upon certification of an exclusive bargaining representative, the city and its representatives and the union and/or its representatives shall meet and confer at reasonable times and places to attempt to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement. The city's bargaining representatives shall include at least two, but no more than three, members of the common council appointed by the common council president. At least one common council member shall be present at all bargaining meetings. 
(a)  Nothing in this article shall prevent the employer from negotiating on any issues, unless prevented by state or federal law. 
(b)  All agreements reached between the city and an exclusive bargaining representative as a result of collective bargaining will be reduced to writing in the form of a contract between the parties. 
(c)  A hand-executed copy of the agreement will be provided to each party and each will bear the cost of reproducing copies as needed. The city is responsible for providing copies and orientation to management employees, supervisors and confidential employees. The exclusive representative is responsible for providing copies and orientation to the employees in the bargaining unit. 
(d)  An agreement is effective when the union president and the mayor sign the agreement and it is approved by the common council. Provisions in multiyear agreements providing for economic increases in subsequent years shall be contingent upon the common council appropriating sufficient funds to fund the agreed-upon increase for a subsequent year. 
(Ord. No. 01-61, § 6, 11-6-01; Ord. No. 12-12, § 1, 6-5-12) 
Sec. 62-127. - Payroll deduction of employee organization fees. 
    The employer may, upon receipt of a written and dated authorization of an employee, deduct from the pay of such employee any fees designated or certified by the appropriate officer of that employee's exclusive bargaining representative, and shall remit those fees to the employee's organization. Provided that such authorization was executed subsequent to the passage of this article and presented to the employer within ten days of its execution. Provided further that such deductions are authorized by a valid collective bargaining agreement. 
    Employees may be required, pursuant to the terms of a lawful fair share agreement, to pay a fee which shall be their proportionate share of the costs of the collective bargaining process, contract administration and pursuing matters affecting wages, hours and other conditions of employment. 
(Ord. No. 01-61, § 7, 11-6-01) 
Sec. 62-128. - Unfair labor practices.

(2)  Discriminate in regard to hiring or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization; 
(3)  Refuse to bargain collectively with an exclusive representative.

(a)  Only persons who have a minimum of three years of experience directly related to labor and employment relations in representing public employers, private employers or labor organizations; or teaching labor or employment relations; or administering executive orders or regulations applicable to labor or employment relations shall be appointed to the committee. 
(b)  However, the mayor and/or the city council may change these requirements if the mayor is unable to find suitable appointees meeting these qualifications. 
(c)  Members of the committee shall hold no other public office or employment by the city, state or other public agency or public employer, or be an officer or employee of any employee organization or any of its affiliates, who represent or seek to represent employees employed by the city. However, this restriction does not apply to persons on the teaching staff of a university who are knowledgeable in public administration or labor law so long as they are not actively engaged, other than as a member, with any labor or employee organization. 
(Ord. No. 01-61, § 9, 11-6-01) 
Sec. 62-130. - Impasse. 
    Either the employer or an exclusive representative may declare that an impasse has been reached between them in collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment and may request to participate in nonbinding mediation with Federal Mediation and Conciliatory Services. The services of the mediator including applicable per diem expenses shall be borne equally by the parties. Any individually incurred costs shall be borne by the party incurring them. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the parties from mutually agreeing to substitute an alternate procedure for resolving impasses in collective bargaining with that provided herein or from agreeing to utilize the services of a mediator not affiliated with Federal Mediation and Conciliatory Services.

ARTICLE IV. - ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES 
DIVISION 1. - SUBDIVISION PROCEDURE 

Sec. 66-151. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the subdivision requirements of this development code is to promote the public health, safety, general welfare and preserve the aesthetic quality of the city through the regulation and control of the division of land. To achieve this purpose, the regulations contained in this development code are determined to be necessary to promote orderly growth and development, open space, conservation, protection and proper use of land; and to ensure adequate provision for traffic circulation, utilities, and other services in the city. 
(Ord. No. 99-37, Art. 4, Div. 1, § 1, 7-6-99) 
Sec. 66-152. - Subdivision approval process. 
    An applicant desiring approval of a primary or secondary plat of a subdivision of any land lying within the jurisdiction of the plan commission shall comply with the following procedure: 
(1)  Every applicant shall participate in a pre-application meeting with the City of Portage Planning Department. The purpose of the meeting is to: 
(a)  Acquaint the developer with the city's standards and requirements of all ordinances and the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Review the intent of the procedures and requirements of the city. 
(c)  Acquaint the developer with any limiting characteristics of the property under review. 
(2)  Upon receipt of a completed application, the applicant will be placed on a DRC agenda. The applicant and his/her agent shall attend the meeting. 
(3)  Applications for primary and secondary plats shall be reviewed and forwarded to the plan commission within 30 days of receipt of a completed application. DRC recommendations based upon the goals and objectives of the City of Portage Comprehensive Plan as well as the established zoning and development standards of the City of Portage will accompany the completed application. 
(4)  A primary plat shall be reviewed and voted upon by the plan commission in a public hearing, as set forth in this division. 
(5)  A secondary plat shall be reviewed and voted upon by the plan commission, signed by the president and executive secretary of the plan commission, and filed with the Porter County Recorder, as set forth in this division. 
(Ord. No. 99-37, Art. 4, Div. 1, § 2, 7-6-99; Ord. No. 02-34, § 2, 8-6-02) 
Sec. 66-153. - General restrictions. 
(a)  The following actions may occur once the final plat has been signed and recorded: 
(1)  The granting of an improvement location permit, or the construction of any public improvements authorized thereby; 
(2)  Contracts made for the sale of any part of the subdivision. 
(b)  No building permit shall be issued until the plat has been recorded. 
(c)  No building permit shall be issued for the construction of any building or structure located on a lot or plat subdivided or sold in violation of the provisions of this article IV, administrative procedures. 
(Ord. No. 99-37, Art. 4, Div. 1, § 3, 7-6-99) 
Sec. 66-154. - Resubdivisions (replats). 
(a)  For any change in a map of an approved or recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on such map, or area reserved thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it affects any map or plan legally recorded prior to the adoption of any regulations controlling subdivision, such change shall be approved by the plan commission by the same procedure, rules, and regulations as for a subdivision. 
(b)  Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided, the plan commission may require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. As a requirement of the plat, dedications of rights-of-way shall be provided for the future opening and extension of such streets. 
(Ord. No. 99-37, Art. 4, Div. 1, § 4, 7-6-99) 
Sec. 66-155. - Variances to subdivision standards. 
(a)  Variances to subdivision standards of this unified development chapter shall not be granted by the board of zoning appeals, but may be granted by the plan commission subject to the applicable requirements herein. It is not within the jurisdiction of the board of zoning appeals to grant variances to subdivision regulations. 
(b)  It is the intention of this ordinance that all newly created lots conform to the provisions of this ordinance for lot area and width. Variances to these or other zoning standards may be granted subject to the provisions of article IV, division 5, zoning variances. It is not within the jurisdiction of the plan commission to grant variances to zoning regulations. 
(c)  Where the plan commission finds that extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with the subdivision regulations of article 4, division 1 or if the purposes of these regulations may be better served by an alternative proposal, it may approve variances to said regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that such variances shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and further provided the plan commission shall not approve variances unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
(1)  The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare, or injurious to other property. 
(2)  The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable generally to other property. 
(3)  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out. Financial hardship does not constitute grounds for a variance. 
(4)  The variance will not in any manner vary the provisions of the comprehensive master plan or this unified development chapter. 
(5)  Where the variance impacts on design and construction of public facilities, all appropriate public agencies will be given ample time to comment in writing to the commission. 
(d)  In approving variances, the plan commission may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements of these regulations. 
(e)  A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in writing by the subdivider at the time when the sketch plat is filed for the consideration of the planning director. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.

(Ord. No. 99-37, Art. 5, Div. 2, § 3, 7-6-99) 
Sec. 66-344. - Lots. 
(a)  Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with this chapter and health regulations, in providing driveway access to buildings on the lots from an approved street, or in providing service to public sanitary sewer or approved sanitary disposal facilities. All lots shall abut on a street. 
(b)  Lot dimension. 
(1)  No lot or parcel shall be used for any residential use unless such lot abuts a public street for at least 60 percent of the lot width prescribed for the district in which the lot is located. 
(2)  Corner residential lots shall be wider than normal in order to permit appropriate setbacks from both streets and the erection of buildings. 
(3)  Where lots are more than double the minimum required area for the zoning district, the plan commission may require that those lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where they would be necessary to serve potential lots, all in compliance with this chapter. 
(4)  Widths and areas of lots shall be not less than that provided in article VII for the district in which the subdivision is located. 
(5)  Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial, or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated, as established in this chapter. 
(c)  Lot lines. 
(1)  Side lines of lots shall be of approximately right angles to straight streets and on radial lines on curved streets. Some variation from this rule is permissible, but pointed or very irregular lots should be avoided. 
(d)  Double frontage lots and access to lots. 
(1)  Double frontage lots should not be platted, except that where desired along arterial streets, lots may face on an interior street and back on such thoroughfares. In that event a planting strip for a screen of at least 20 feet in width shall be provided along the back of the lot. Access may not be provided onto the arterials 
(2)  Lots with less than 200 feet shall not, in general, derive access exclusively from an arterial. Where driveway access from an arterial may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the plan commission may require that such lots be served by a combined access drive in order to limit traffic hazards on the street. Driveways should be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on arterials. 
(e)  Waterbodies and watercourses. If a tract being subdivided contains a water body or portion thereof, lot lines shall be drawn to distribute ownership of the water body among adjacent lots. The plan commission may approve an alternative plan whereby the ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so placed that it will not become a local government responsibility. No portion of the minimum area of lot required under this chapter may be satisfied by land that is under water. 
(f)  Easements. Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at least 15 feet wide except as modified by section 66-345(a)(1).

(1)  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, submitting plans for approval by the control authority, receiving construction permit, applying for an IWP if necessary, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
(2)  No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months; 
(3)  The user shall submit a progress report to the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
(4)  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent. 
(c)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent a report containing the information described in subsections 82-204(a)(4)d. and e. of this division. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in section 82-202, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports shall be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 82-204(o) of this division. All sampling shall be done in conformance with subsection 82-204(k). 
(d)  Periodic compliance reports. 
(1)  Users shall, at a frequency determined by the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent, submit no less than twice per year (June and December) reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards, and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation required by the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
(2)  Reports of permittees shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration or production and mass where requested by the pretreatment coordinator of pollutants contained therein that are limited. The pretreatment coordinator may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements if necessary to meet the objective of this division. In such cases, the report required by subsection (1) above shall indicate the mass of pollutants in the effluent of the user. 
(3)  All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the subsection 82-204(j) of this division, subsection 304(g) of the Act and 40 CPR Part 136. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with subsection 82-204(k) of this division and the techniques approved by the pretreatment coordinator, IDEM and/or the U.S. EPA. 
(4)  All periodic compliance reports shall be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 82-204(o) of this division. 
(5)  All wastewater samples shall be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(6)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent, using the procedures prescribed in subsection 82-204(k) of this division, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(7)  User shall submit a copy of the monthly report of operations (MRO) and discharge monitoring report (DMR) to the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent not later than the 28 th day of the month following the reporting period. 
(e)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user shall notify the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent of any changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 15 days before the change. 
(1)  These changes may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under this division to IDEM. 
(2)  IDEM may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this division. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent places advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (1) above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who could cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(4)  Significant industrial users are required to notify the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
(g)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent as the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may require. 
(h)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the city performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city performs sampling at the user's facility between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city receives the results of this sampling, or if the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user. 
(i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)  No hazardous waste may be discharged to the POTW. 
(j)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques to be submitted as part of reports, shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the U.S. EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent or other parties approved by U.S. EPA. 
(k)  Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements shall be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsections (3) and (4) below, the user shall collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples shall be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate U.S. EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved U.S. EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
(2)  Compliance shall be determined as stated in each IWP. Where not explicitly stated in the industry's IWP, compliance shall be determined at end of pipe unless end of pipe is located in an unreasonable or inaccessible location. In the event the end of pipe is located in an unreasonable or inaccessible location, compliance shall be determined at end of process location. 
(3)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds shall be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(4)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four grab samples shall be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by section 40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(l)  Sampling frequency. Pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent reserve the right to require additional sampling and testing over and above the frequency required in a user's IWP. Additional sampling and testing may be required when a user's discharge is violating limits in the IWP or to verify the consistency of the wastestream with the latest compliance report. 
(m)  Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(n)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this division, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best management practices established under subsection 82-202(d)(3). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent. 
(o)  Certification statements. 
(1)  Certification of permit applications, user reports and initial monitoring waiver. The following certification statement is required to be signed and submitted by users submitting baseline monitoring reports under subsection 82-204(a)(4)h.; users submitting reports on compliance with the categorical pretreatment standard deadlines under subsection 82-204(c); and users submitting periodic compliance reports required by subsections 82-204(d)(1)-(3). The following certification statement shall be signed by an authorized representative as defined in subsection 82-201(d)(4): 
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.

Sec. 82-206. - Confidential 
information. 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request shall be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. No. 09-17, § 1, 4-7-09) 
Sec. 82-207. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
    The pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the previous 12 months, were in Significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all significant industrial users (or any other industrial user that violates subsections (3), (4) or (8) of this section) and shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined in section 82-202; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by section 82-202 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by section 82-202 (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;

(8)  Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best management practices, which the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 09-17, § 1, 4-7-09) 
Sec. 82-208. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. When the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 15 days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections 82-208(d) and (e) of this division and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least five days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user as defined in subsection 82-201(d)(4). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(d)  Compliance orders. When the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. When the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Administrative fines. 
(1)  When the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may fine such user, as a maximum fine, $2,500.00 per day per violation, in accordance with IC 36-1-3-8(a)(10)(B). The pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may impose a fine of less than $2,500.00 per day per violation, as appropriate. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. A more detailed outline for the processes and procedures for issuing fines, including a tiered fine system, are contained in the department's Enforcement Response Guide. 
(2)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of 15 percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of ten percent per month. After 60 days, a lien against the user's property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. After 90 days, service shall be suspended. 
(3)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. The pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection 82-208(h) of this division are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsections 82-208(c) or (h) of this division. 
    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(h)  Termination of discharge. Any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 82-202 of this division. 
(6)  Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection 82-208(c) of this division why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(i)  Appeals. 
(1)  Users desiring to appeal such notices of violation, orders, suspensions, and/or fines shall file a written request to the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent to reconsider the notices of violation, orders, suspensions, and/or fines along with full payment of the fine amount within 15 days of being notified of the notice of violation, orders, suspensions, and/or fines. 
(2)  The pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent shall determine within 15 days from receipt of written request whether the request has merit. Where a request has merit, the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may rescind the notice of violation, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The portions of the notices of violation, orders, or suspensions found to be without merit shall be revoked. Notices of violations, orders, suspensions, and/or fines shall be severable and those portions not revoked shall remain in full force and effect. 
a.  Where the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent determines the request does not have merit the fine payment will be retained and the administrative enforcements will remain in full force and effect. 
(3)  If the user is in disagreement with the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent's decision regarding the notice of violation, orders, suspensions, and/or fines, the user may request a hearing with the utility service board. The request for hearing must be received by the board's secretary not later than 15 days after the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent's decision was received by the user. 
(4)  The board, at its next regularly scheduled meeting, will schedule a hearing. In the event that the user's discharge has been terminated, the board will schedule the hearing within five working days of the request. 
a.  Where the board determines the user's appeal has merit, user's payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The portions of the notices of violation, orders, or suspensions found to be without merit shall be revoked. Notices of violations, orders, suspensions, and/or fines shall be severable and those portions not revoked shall remain in full force and effect. 
b.  Where the board determines the request does not have merit the fine payment will be retained and the administrative enforcements will remain in full force and effect. 
(5)  Once the user has appealed to the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent and the utility service board, the administrative appeals process shall be exhausted. 
(6)  The pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.

(Ord. No. 09-17, § 1, 4-7-09) 
Sec. 82-211. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with this division or categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with this division and/or categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (3) below are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission shall be provided within five days): 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 82-202(a)(1) of this division or the specific prohibitions in subsections 82-202(a)(2)c. through 82-202(a)(2)aa. of this division if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
b.  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (3) and (4) below. 
(3)  Bypass notifications. 
a.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
b.  A user shall submit oral notice to the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(4)  Bypass. 
a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
1.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
3.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (3) above. 
(b)  The pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the pretreatment coordinator and/or superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection(4)a. above.

ARTICLE IV. - OVERLAY DISTRICTS 

Sec. 90-4.1. - CE-OL district-Intent, effect on uses and development standards. 
District Intent Effect on Uses Development Standards The corridor enhancement overlay district (CE-OL) has been created to promote community goals and objectives for aesthetics along key corridors within the planning jurisdiction of the zoning ordinance. It is also the intent of this district to promote safe pedestrian and vehicular circulation, traffic management, and mitigation of traffic congestion through appropriate site design and development standards. 
The plan commission should strive to minimize sign clutter, lighting, negative visual impacts and proliferation of access points. In addition, the plan commission should strive to strengthen the quality of life through design that links pedestrian accessibility and ensures their safety, creates an efficient circulation pattern, and contributes to quality character in Portage. Permitted uses 
All uses permitted in the base zoning district are permitted in the CE-OL zoning district. 
Special exception uses 
All uses permitted in the base zoning district as special exceptions are permitted as special exceptions in the CE-OL zoning district.  When the development standards outlined in the following sections in this article (sections 90-4.2 through 90-4.4) conflict with the base zoning district development standards in article VI, the development standards in this article (sections 90-4.2 through 90-4.4) shall apply. All applicable development standards in article VI that are not addressed in this article will still apply in accordance with the base zoning district. 
 The development standards for the CE-OL shall be construed to be applicable to planned developments which are overlaid by this district.  
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
_____
Sec. 90-4.2. - Jurisdictional boundary for the corridor enhancement overlay district. 
(a)  The jurisdictional boundaries for the corridor enhancement overlay district (CE-OL) shall be shown on the official zoning map as a hatch or textured pattern and noted on the map legend as the corridor enhancement overlay district (CE-OL). Where boundaries do not follow property lines or other distinguishable lines, measurements shall be used to denote boundaries. 
(b)  The following major and minor arterials as identified on the thoroughfare plan of the Portage Comprehensive Plan (page 44) are included in the corridor enhancement overly district: 
(1)  U.S. Highway 6; 
(2)  U.S. Highway 12;

(d)  The corridor enhancement overlay district boundaries apply to all lots within a development. This shall include all frontage lots and rear lots within a development. 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-4.3. - Additional development standards for the corridor enhancement overlay district. 
    The following development standards are required as follows in order to promote the intent of this zoning district and meet the goals of the Portage Comprehensive Plan. 
(a)  Adjustments to setbacks are as follows: All setbacks adjacent to a collector or arterial street are to be 40 feet. 
(b)  Access road, frontage road, and local street separation shall be as follows: If the Portage Comprehensive Plan or an adopted subarea plan for the city calls for a frontage road running parallel or relatively parallel with a collector or arterial street or calls for an access road, then the development must include the frontage or access road as per the details of the comprehensive plan or small area plan. 
(c)  Access road, frontage road or local street connections to collector or arterial streets shall be as follows: Access road curb cuts onto a collector or arterial street shall be consistent with the Portage Comprehensive Plan, Thoroughfare Plan Map, and Subarea Plans. In no event shall two access road curb cuts be within 500 feet of one another. Further, any access road curb cut must align with any existing or proposed curb cut on the opposite side of the street and within reason able distance. 
(d)  To ensure the design and placement of structures will enhance aesthetics, improve vehicular safety and accomplish the intent of this overlay district, the following development standards are required: 
1.  All structures placed along the corridor shall be designed so that the elevations visible from the corridor are given the best or equal representation of the building's architectural character. 
2.  No loading docks, service entrances, or mechanical equipment may be located on or in front of the facades facing the primary roadway. 
3.  Utility boxes shall be placed at least 30 feet off of the primary corridor's edge of pavement. 
(e)  Parking lots shall be generally located and connected such to provide vehicular connectivity between businesses. Access roads can be utilized for connectivity between parking lots, but utilization of collector and arterial roads shall not meet the requirement for connectivity. 
(f)  Parking lots shall generally be designed to minimize aesthetic impacts when the property is viewed from primary roadways. 
(g)  A sign package shall be submitted for consideration by the development review committee. Signs shall be de signed, sized and placed such to enhance vehicular safety along primary roadways. For that reason the petitioner must prepare a sign package which clearly identifies the type, size, height, lighting, and location. The following design and placement guidelines shall be required: 
1.  Signs shall be placed such that they do not encourage visual clutter. 
2.  Freestanding signs must have landscaping placed at the base of the sign. 
3.  Tenant signs in multitenant structures shall be combined onto a single sign when feasible. 
4.  Tenant signs on the facade of a multitenant development shall maintain consistency of size, height from the ground, intensity of lighting, and sign style (e.g. reverse channel, box). Multiple sign styles on a single primary structure shall not be permitted. 
(h)  An architectural features package shall be submitted for consideration by the development review committee. Architectural features must comply with the following regulations: 
1.  Exterior facades must not incorporate vinyl or metal siding. 
2.  Exterior facades must dominantly be brick or fluted concrete. 
3.  Exterior facades must be accented with a distinguishable second building material, texture, or color to provide visual interest and architectural character. 
4.  Roofs must not be mansard style. 
(i)  A landscaping package shall be submitted for consideration by the development review committee. Landscaping shall generally follow the requirements for the base zoning district, but the petitioner may propose landscaping that better enhances the property. In general, landscaping shall accomplish the following: 
1.  Provide at least partial screening of the parking lot. 
2.  Aesthetically enhance the base of freestanding signs, the foundation of a structure, the primary structure, and lot area. 
(j)  All common areas or landscaped areas along the primary corridor(s) shall be properly maintained by the property owner or by a contract, covenant or bylaws of an association. Any contract, covenant or bylaws of an association shall be presented to the plan commission and recorded as surety for longterm maintenance. 
(k)  All new utilities and service "drops" must be done so underground. 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-4.4 - Incentives for the corridor enhancement overlay district. 
(a)  The purpose of this incentive program is to facilitate positive attributes for vehicular safety, the intent of this district, and the goals of the Portage Comprehensive Plan. It acknowledges that there are costs associated with the additional development standards in this overlay district. Therefore, it invites new development to participate as a partner with the community in this safety and quality-of-life effort. 
(b)  The following bonus applies to any development that abides by all development standards included in this overlay district. If a variance is requested to any of the development standards in this overlay district, the bonus will not be applicable to that property or development. The bonus is: Parking lots may be shared between two primary structures and each property may reduce their overall parking spaces required by ten percent. The participating properties may extend their parking lots to the property line, as long as each parking lot design is consistent with the other and appears to be designed as a single parking lot.

(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-5.6. - Regular revisions. 
    The official zoning map should be formally revised annually, or as the plan commission determines necessary. During interim periods of time, hand-drawn lines and text on the official zoning map will be appropriate to note zoning changes. Copies may be made after the amendments are noted, and each copy shall be noted as an update with the "date last changed" noted on the map. Other revisions may be made to correct drafting or other errors and omission in the prior map, but shall not have the effect of amending the official zoning map except as adopted by the common council. 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-5.7. - Damaged, destroyed or lost official zoning map. 
    In the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret due to the nature or number of changes, the common council may, by resolution, adopt a new official zoning map which shall, to the extent possible, duplicate the accuracy of the damaged, destroyed or lost map. 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-5.8. - Official zoning map standards. 
    District boundaries on the official zoning map shall be interpreted as follows: 
(a)  District boundaries shown within or parallel to the lines of roads, easements, and transportation rights-of-way shall be deemed to follow the center line of the affected road, easement, or right-of-way. 
(b)  District boundaries indicated as following section or fractional sectional lines, platted lot lines, or city or town corporation lines shall be construed as following such lines. 
(c)  District boundaries indicated as parallel to section or fractional sectional lines, platted lot lines, city or town corporation lines, shall be construed as parallel to the affected line. 
(d)  District boundaries indicated as approximately following the center line of streams, rivers, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such center lines. 
(e)  Where a district boundary line divides a lot at the time such line is adopted, the regulations for the less restricted portion of such lot shall extend not more than 25 feet into the more restricted portion, provided the lot has frontage on a street in the less restricted district. Further, the exact location of where the line crosses the property shall be determined by the director of community development. 
(f)  When the director of community development cannot definitely determine the location of a district boundary by the center lines, by scale or dimensions stated on the official zoning map, because the boundary does not clearly coincide with a property line, the director may refuse action and the plan commission may interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to the scale of the official zoning map and the purposes set forth in all relevant provisions of this zoning ordinance.

ARTICLE VI. - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 14-8, §§ 1 and 2, adopted Aug. 5, 2014, repealed Art. VI and enacted a new article as set out herein. The former Art. VI, §§ 90-6.1-90-6.72, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, adopted Aug. 2, 2005; Ord. No. 06-55, § 3, adopted Oct. 3, 2006; Ord. No. 08-39, § 1, adopted Aug. 5, 2008; Ord. No. 10-19, Exh. A, adopted May 5, 2010; Ord. No. 11-06, § 1(Exh. A), adopted Feb. 7, 2011; Ord. No. 13-13, § 1, adopted July 2, 2013; and Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, adopted July 2, 2013. 

Sec. 90-6.1. - Introduction. 
    All structures, buildings, land uses, land use changes, structural alterations, structural relocations, demolitions, structural additions, and structural enlargements that are constructed, created, established, or occur after the effective date of the zoning ordinance (except as may otherwise be provided within the zoning ordinance) are subject to all development standards and regulations for the applicable zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 14-8, § 2, 8-5-14) 
Sec. 90-6.2. - How to use this article. 
    Article VI contains development standards which are arranged by category. Refer to the two-letter or letter-number zoning district abbreviations identified at the top of each development standard section in Article VI. These abbreviations note that the development standard written in that section applies to that district. 
    The development standards assigned to each zoning district are considered appropriate for the permitted uses within that district; however, the development standards may not be considered appropriate for all special exception uses within a zoning district. The board of zoning appeals shall determine which development standard sections within Article VI shall apply to special exception applications. The development standards determined to apply shall be documented in the application and approval. If the special exception use is a permitted use within another district, the development standards for that district must be used as a guideline. In situations where the special exception use is not a permitted use in any district, the most stringent development standards may be assigned by the board of zoning appeals as appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 14-8, § 2, 8-5-14) 
Sec. 90-6.3. - Environmental standards. 
    This environmental standards section applies to the following districts:

1.  Contains adverse soil or rock formations; 
2.  Is highly susceptible to erosion; 
3.  Has low percolation rate; 
4.  Has low weight bearing strength; or 
5.  Has any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, prosperity, aesthetics, and general welfare of the community. 
C.  Erosion prevention. All land, regardless of slope, from which structures or natural cover has been removed or otherwise destroyed, must be appropriately graded and seeded within 30 days after the removal or destruction of said natural cover to prevent erosion. 
D.  Alterations to shoreline. No alteration of the shoreline or bed of a stream or creek shall be made until written approval is obtained from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Army Corp. of Engineers, and the provisions of this zoning ordinance are complied with. Alterations include, among other things, filling of a stream, creek, regulated ditch or wetlands, and dredging of a stream, creek or ditch. 
E.  Retention, detention, and pond edges. The use of engineered hard edges is not permitted except around inlets and outlets. The use of engineered hard edges may not exceed five percent of the lineal feet of the total edge of any retention facility, detention facility, or pond.

    This drive-thru standards section applies to any drive-thru facility: 
PR IS NC OC C1 C2 HC BP LI HI (MW if nonresidential use) 
CR CM and CC if nonresidential use (with additional review) 
    Additional review: The director of community development shall conduct an urban design review of drive-thru proposals within the CR, CM, and/or CC districts (downtown) to determine whether or not such proposal is complementary to investment plans within the downtown. 
    The following drive-thru standards apply and shall be part of a site plan prepared by a licensed engineer and reviewed in the site plan approval process: 
A.  General drive-thru design. Any drive-thru shall be designed using the following objectives and standards in order to promote compatible development that fits well with and improves its existing or planned context: 
1.  District character. Protect and enhance the character and quality of the district and neighborhood where the drive-thru facility is located. Provide ample landscaping, in combination with building orientation, to enhance the streetscape and define the street edge when setting buildings back from the street is unavoidable. The number and width of driveways from the public street shall be minimized to help reduce interruptions to the public sidewalk. 
2.  Community focus. Enhance public streets and contribute to high quality public space. Surface parking areas and stacking lanes shall be located at the side or rear of the building. Locating the stacking lane between the primary facade of the building and the public street shall be avoided. 
3.  Neighborly consideration. Minimize impacts on adjacent land uses that could be caused by on-site activities. Use every effort to locate stacking lanes away from adjacent sensitive uses, such as residential and outdoor amenity areas, to reduce the impacts of noise and pollution that could be caused by stacking cars on such uses. Elements to add visual and environmental interest shall be used to help buffer potential impacts. Landscaping is preferred. 
4.  Traffic circulation. Create efficient stacking movements on site. Each drive-thru aisle shall be separated from the circulation routes necessary for ingress or egress from the property or access to a parking space. The start point to the stacking lane shall be located in such a way that the queued vehicles do not block traffic along the public streets or the movement of other vehicles on site. Separate stacking lanes shall be provided when multiple drive-thru uses exist on the same site. Landscaped islands, decorative pavement, pervious islands and painted lines shall be used to separate stacking lanes when multiple drive-thru uses exist on the same site. 
5.  Pedestrian environment. Create a safe and comfortable pedestrian environment on site. On-site circulation shall be designed to minimize the conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles. Entrance doors shall be directly accessible from both the public sidewalk and parking areas. Pedestrian walkways should not intersect the drive-thru drive aisles, but where they do, the walkways shall have clear visibility and shall be emphasized by enriched paving or striping. Landscaped islands, decorative pavement, pervious islands and painted lines shall be used to define and enhance pedestrian areas. 
B.  Drive-thru aisle specifics. The minimum standards for drive-thru aisles are as follows: 
1.  Each drive-thru aisle shall be constructed with Portland cement concrete. 
2.  Each drive-thru aisle shall have a minimum ten-foot interior radius at curves and a minimum 12-foot width. 
3.  Each drive-thru aisle shall queue at least four standard vehicles between the menu board and the entry point into the drive-thru aisle. If the drive-thru has a pick-up window, the drive-thru aisle shall accommodate the stacking of two standard vehicles between the window and the menu board. A stacking space is 12 feet wide by 20 feet long. (The city may approve a reduction of the stacking requirements of this section upon demonstration by a qualified traffic engineer that a reduction in the stacking requirements is appropriate for the applicant's proposed use given its proposed intensity or context. Minor deviations of these requirements that reduce the stacking distance by less than one stacking space may be approved by the approval body without a demonstration by a licensed traffic engineer if the applicant demonstrates that strict compliance with this section is impracticable or would lead to a lower quality of site design.) 
4.  Stacking lanes shall not interfere with parking spaces, parking aisles, loading spaces, internal site circulation, or points of ingress and egress. Stacking spaces may not be used to satisfy any of the off-street parking requirements. 
5.  Each entrance to an aisle and the direction of traffic flow shall be clearly designated by signs and pavement markings. Pedestrian walkways that intersect the drive-through drive aisles, shall have clear visibility, and be emphasized by enriched paving or striping. 
6.  A 12-foot bypass lane is required adjacent to the stacking lane to allow vehicles to circumvent the stacking lane.

    The following landscape standards apply: 
A.  Planting areas. The zoning ordinance recognizes the need for landscaping requirements in four different areas on a property: lot planting areas, foundation planting areas, parking lot planting areas, and buffer yard areas. The following image conceptually demonstrates the location of each landscape area. 
_____

_____ 
B.  Native planting requirements. Planting requirements vary by zoning district, as identified in this article. The use of species native to the region is required. All deciduous trees must have at least a two-inch caliper and all evergreens must be at least six feet in height when planted. All deciduous tree sizes must be measured using DBH, and all evergreen tree sizes must be determined by measuring height. Under no circumstances may any dead or artificial plant be installed and/or counted as part of the minimum planting required. 
C.  Tree preservation. The preservation of an existing healthy tree shall constitute a credit toward the minimum landscape requirements in the zoning ordinance. A credit will be given per tree that contributes to and satisfies the intent of a particular section of the landscape standards in this article. Orange construction fencing must be installed during construction at or beyond the dripline of each tree to be preserved. These trees must also be marked "Do Not Remove" on the site plan. Any trees marked "Do Not Remove" on the site plan that are removed or injured beyond repair must be replaced by one or more similar specie trees with a cumulative DBH of 1.25 times the DBH of the tree which was to be preserved. The following credits shall be granted for an existing tree as follows: 
  Each preserved deciduous tree between four and eight inches DBH shall be granted credit for two deciduous trees. 
  Each preserved deciduous tree between eight and 12 inches DBH shall be granted credit for three deciduous trees. 
  Each preserved deciduous tree over 12 inches DBH shall be granted credit for four deciduous trees. 
  For each preserved evergreen tree over ten feet tall a credit for two evergreen trees shall be granted. 
D.  Landscaping easements/right-of-way. Hardscape material and/or softscape material may extend into an existing or proposed easement with the written permission from the easement holder. Such landscape material may extend into the existing or proposed right-of-way with the written permission of the board of public works and safety. Such special permission is not necessary for the installation of street trees; however, utilities should always be marked prior to any planting. 
E.  Maintenance. The landowner and their successors in interest are responsible for the regular maintenance of all landscaping elements. All hardscape material shall be refinished, repaired, cleaned and/or replaced periodically to maintain a structurally and aesthetically sound condition. All softscape material shall be maintained free from disease, pests, weeds, litter and erosion. Any softscape material required by this zoning ordinance, the plan commission, director of community development, or the board of zoning appeals that dies, or is otherwise removed, must be replaced within 60 days of death. The director of community development may grant up to a 90-day extension due to the weather. 
F.  Substitutions. Substitutions or alterations of minimal planting required may be reviewed and approved by the director of community development, but must be equal to or greater than that which is required.

(Ord. No. 14-8, § 2, 8-5-14) 
Sec. 90-6.60. - Swimming pool standards. 
    This swimming pool standards section applies to the following districts: 
CO PR R1 R2 R3 R4 M1 M2 M3 MP MW CR CM CC IS NC OC C1 C2 HC BP LI HI 
    The following swimming pool standards apply: 
A.  Swimming pools must abide by this zoning ordinance as well as Indiana State Code. 
B.  Definitions pertaining to swimming pools are as follows: 
Swimming pool: A self-contained body of water that is at least 18 inches deep at any point and used for recreational purposes; or is identified by the manufacturer as a swimming pool; or requires a circulating pump or filter. 
Swimming pool, permanent: Any swimming pool which requires hardware or permanent installation structures to be erected. 
Swimming pool, seasonal: Any swimming pool that is erected above ground without the need for hardware or permanent installation structures. 
C.  Private swimming pools shall be permitted as an accessory use within the rear or side yards only, provided they meet the following requirements: 
1.  There shall be a minimum distance of not less than ten feet from the adjoining property lines and the outside of the pool wall. Side yard setbacks shall apply if greater than ten feet. 
2.  There shall be a distance of not less than six feet between the outside pool wall and any building located on the same lot. 
3.  There shall be a minimum distance of not less than ten feet horizontally from overhead power lines. 
4.  There shall be a minimum distance of 22 feet of vertical clearance from overhead power lines. 
5.  There shall be a minimum distance of five feet from an underground power line. 
6.  A swimming pool shall not be located over an underground gas line. 
7.  A swimming pool shall not be located in any easement. 
8.  For the protection of the general public, all private swimming pools shall be completely enclosed by a fence not less than six feet in height. The gate shall be of self-closing and latching type, with a latch on the inside of the gate, not readily available for children to open. The gate shall be capable of being securely locked. The fence may enclose the pool itself or the yard in which the pool is located. The structural sides of an above-ground swimming pool may be used in satisfying a portion of the fence height requirement. In such cases, the six foot height shall be met by the addition of vertical fence extensions from the pool sides or other means. 
9.  While the State of Indiana recognizes the difference in construction between permanent and seasonal/temporary pools, it makes no distinction between the two in the matter of safety; therefore, all swimming pools, whether permanent or seasonal, are required to have a six-foot fence surrounding the yard or the pool. 
a.  Permanent. All permanent pools are required to have a six-foot fence surrounding the yard or the pool at all times of the year. 
b.  Seasonal. All seasonal pools shall have at least a temporary or seasonal fence installed around the pool that is firmly anchored to the ground and structurally capable of restricting access. This temporary fence is required to be maintained around the seasonal pool and removed when the seasonal pool is removed. Material acceptable for a seasonal fence as structurally sound enough to provide safety may be lattice, farm/garden fencing or any other material approved by the building inspector. Material that is not acceptable for a seasonal fence as not structurally sound enough to provide safety include chicken wire, snow fence or any other material rejected by the building inspector.

ARTICLE VII. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS 

Sec. 90-7.1. - PD district intent, permitted uses and miscellaneous standards. 
Permitted Uses Permitted Uses Prerequisite Standards The purposes of these regulations are to provide greater design flexibility in the development of land when consistent with the comprehensive plan and intent of the zoning ordinance and subdivision control ordinance. 
The use of planned development zoning classifications shall be encouraged when the use of such regulations promotes a harmonious variety of uses, and/or provides for an economy of shared services and facilities, and/or is compatible with surrounding areas and/or fosters the creation of attractive, healthful, efficient and stable environments for living, shopping or working. 
The planned development regulations and procedures may apply to the further development of existing developed landsor to vacant lands. 
The request for a planned development should be for one or more of the following: All uses are subject to the discretion and approval of the plan commission. No uses are granted by right. 
In general, the uses that will be considered in a planned development are: uses designated as permitted uses or special exceptions in the base zone district. 
(For example if the previous zoning was R2 and the proposed planned development district would be PD-R2, the permitted uses and special exceptions in the R2 District would generally be appropriate.) 
All other land uses will be reviewed and considered at the discretion of the plan commission. Mixed uses will be considered and may be encouraged when appropriate. All land uses proposed in a PD must be nonconflicting and in the spirit of the comprehensive plan, the previous zoning district, surrounding land uses and zoning districts. Minimum Land Area. 
 Ten acres to qualify for any PD 
Minimum Lot Frontage: 
 50 feet on a public street with access from said public street 
Maximum Lot Coverage: 
 Square footage of all primary and accessory structures, and impervious surface cannot exceed 65 percent of the lot area 
Minimum Floor Area: 
 Based on base zone district, when applicable 
Maximum Structure Height: 
 Based on base zone district 
Minimum Open Space: 
 30 percent (gross area) for residentially dominant planned developments 
 15 percent (gross area) for commercially dominant planned developments  Unique and creative designs such as those that have special architectural character or other features which are complementary to the city which cannot, through standard zoning, be achieved; 
 Unusual existing physical conditions, including severe topography, sensitive drainage patterns, traffic circumstances, or environmental features that are unique to the subject site, and that could not be accommodated through the standard zoning districts; and 
 Mixed uses that include different types of land uses arranged in a way that could not be accomplished through the use of the standard zoning districts. Mixed use developments should share an architecture theme, landscape theme, clustering and conservation of land, and integration of natural features that are in combination complementary to Portage. 
Any other types of planned developments will not be permitted.  
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-7.2. - General. 
    Planned developments are a special district that can be pursued by an applicant. 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-7.3. - Rezoning to a planned development district. 
    Planned development districts can only be created from the R1, R2, R3, M1, M2, MW, OC, C1, C2, HC, BP and LI zoning districts. From each of these zoning districts (called base zone district during the application process) the following planned development districts can be created once the detailed development plans are approved by the plan commission. They are: 
 R1 districts can only be rezoned to PD-R1. 
 R2 districts can only be rezoned to PD-R2. 
 R3 districts can only be rezoned to PD-R3. 
 M1 districts can only be rezoned to PD-M1. 
 M2 districts can only be rezoned to PD-M2. 
 MW districts can only be rezoned to PD-MW.

 HC districts can only be rezoned to PD-HC. 
 BP districts can only be rezoned to PD-BP. 
 LI districts can only be rezoned to PD-LI. (b) No other zoning district can be rezoned directly to a PD district. An applicant may first ask that a property be rezoned to a zoning district that allows PD districts. Further, if an applicant wants a PD district based on a different base zone a successful rezoning request to change the existing zoning district to the preferred base zone must first be accomplished. 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-7.4. - Planned development uses. 
    Planned developments may contain mixed uses. Depending on the previous zoning the maximum overall square footage allowed by type is as follows: 
Base Zone District PD District Residential Commercial Manufacturing R1 PD-R1 100% 15% 0% R2 PD-R2 100% 20% 0% M1 PD-M1 100% 30% 0% M2 PD-M2 100% 40% 0% MW PD-MW 100% 100% 0% OC PD-OC 50% 100% 0% HC PD-HC 30% 100% 0% C1 PD-C1 40% 100% 0% C2 PD-C2 40% 100% 0% BP PD-BP 20% 40% 100% LI PD-LI 0% 20% 100%  
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-7.5. - Origination of proposals. 
    Any applicant may propose a planned development district in accordance with the procedures in article IX. Further, the applicant making such a proposal must intend to act as developer or sponsor of the development. A parcel or site proposed for a planned development need not be under single ownership. However, if not under single ownership, the multiple owners must have a contractual agreement not to develop the parcels separately, but in accordance with a single, unified plan, and in which the separate owners have given their express intentions to enter into such private agreements and to assure its completion as planned to the satisfaction of the plan commission. 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-7.6. - Limitation of rezoning. 
    Any initiative of the plan commission to amend the zoning ordinance or subdivision control ordinance that would benefit the public health and safety may be imposed on an approved planned development. Also, in the case that the planned development is no longer in conformity with the approved detailed construction or development plans, or is not proceeding in accordance with the time requirements imposed herein or by agreement, any new amendments of the zoning ordinance or subdivision control ordinance may be imposed on the planned development. 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-7.7. - Drafting of a planned development ordinance. 
    The director of community development shall be the author of the planned development ordinance language, unless that role is delegated to the petitioner by the director. In the planned development ordinance the general intent of the zoning ordinance and subdivision control ordinance shall be used as a foundation for regulations. Development standards and subdivision regulations that assure public safety shall be included. 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
ARTICLE VIII. - NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES, LOTS, AND USES 

Sec. 90-8.1. - Intent. 
    Upon adoption of this chapter and official zoning map, some buildings, structures, lots, and uses may no longer conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which they are located. For this reason, article VIII has been generated to provide the rules, policies and regulations that apply to these buildings, structures, lots, and uses referred to as legal-nonconforming (grandfathered). 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-8.2. - Distinction between illegal-nonconforming and legal-nonconforming. 
    A building, structure, or lot which was constructed or is being used without an approved building permit, improvement location permit or approval from the BZA, development review committee, or plan commission is considered illegal-nonconforming. An illegal-nonconforming property shall be subject to actions and penalties allowed by this chapter and all other applicable municipal law and shall be altered to conform with all applicable standards and regulations of this chapter. Further, an illegal-nonconforming building, structure, lot or use is created at the fault of the owner, tenant or property manager. 
    Legal-nonconforming differs from illegal-nonconforming (illegal) in that the reason for the nonconformance is caused by a change to the zoning ordinance. The building, structure, lot or use has not changed, but due to the ordinance change, the property no longer conforms to the policies and standards of the zoning district in which the property resides. When this situation occurs, the property is deemed legal-nonconforming or another term commonly used is "grandfathered." 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-8.3. - Nonconforming buildings and structures. 
(a)  Any continuously occupied, lawfully established structure or building prior to the effective date of this chapter, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer meets the design standards due to the reasons listed below shall be deemed a legal-nonconforming building or structure. 
(b)  Legal-nonconforming building(s) or structure(s) no longer meet one or more of the following development standards of the zoning ordinance: 
 Front, side and rear yard setbacks, 
 Maximum lot coverage, 
 Minimum main floor area, 
 Minimum finished floor area, 
 Height, 
 Temporary structures, 
 Landscaping, 
 Parking, 
 Accessory structures, or 
 Any other provision of the zoning ordinance that is applicable to the building or structure. 
(c)  A legal-nonconforming building or structure may continue provided that it remains the same or fits within the below described tolerances: 
(1)  Any legal-nonconforming building(s) or structure(s) shall not be enlarged or altered in a manner that increases its nonconformity but any building(s) or structure(s) or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
(2)  Any legal-nonconforming single-family residence which is damaged or destroyed by more than 90 percent of its fair market value shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. The property owner bears the burden to prove fair market value and repair/replacement costs. 
(3)  Any legal-nonconforming building or structure, other than a single-family residence, which is damaged or destroyed by more than 60 percent of its fair market value shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. The property owner bears the burden to prove fair market value and repair/replacement costs. 
(d)  If a building or structure is moved for any reason, for any distance, it shall thereafter conform to the provisions of the zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-8.4. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
(a)  All legally established and recorded lots prior to the effective date of this chapter, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer meet the lot standards listed below shall be deemed a legal-nonconforming lot of record. A legal-nonconforming lot of record no longer meets one or more of the following lot standards of this chapter: 
 Lot area; 
 Lot width; 
 Lot depth; 
 Lot frontage; or 
 Any other provision of the zoning ordinance that is applicable to lots. 
(b)  Legal-nonconforming lots of record may be built upon only if the proposed use is permitted and all development standards, other than lot size, of the applicable zoning district of this chapter are met. 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-8.5. - Nonconforming uses of structures, land, or structures and land in combination. 
    Any continuous, lawful use of structures, land, or structures and land in combination established prior to the effective date of this chapter or its subsequent amendments that is no longer a permitted use in the district where it is located shall be deemed a legal-nonconforming use. A legal-nonconforming use may continue provided that it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following conditions: 
(a)  No existing structure devoted to a legal-nonconforming use shall be enlarged, expanded, increased, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered unless it: 
1.  Complies with subsection (d) for limited and small expansions; or 
2.  Changes the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located; or 
3.  Changes the use to a less intensive nonconforming use and is approved by the director of community development or plan commission. 
(b)  No building or structure shall be constructed in connection with an existing legal-nonconforming use of land. 
(c)  Any legal-nonconforming use of a structure may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were plainly arranged or designed for such use at the effective date of this chapter or its subsequent amendments, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the building. 
(d)  In the case of a legal-nonconforming use of structure, the structure may be expanded two times only. Each of the two expansions may not exceed ten percent of the existing floor area. The expansion shall conform to all applicable development standards except for landscaping, unless a variance of developmental standards is received from the board of zoning appeals. The expanded structure must comply with the appropriate parking standards required in article VI of this chapter, as determined by the director of community development. 
(e)  If no structural alterations are made, a legal-nonconforming use of structure or structure and land in combination may be changed to another legal-nonconforming use, provided that the director of community development shall make specific findings that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing legal-nonconforming use. However, if the new use requires more parking area than the previous use, such new use will comply with the appropriate parking standards required in article VI of this chapter, as determined by the director of community development. 
(f)  If a legal-nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months, except when government action impedes access to the premises, any subsequent use of such land, structure or land and structure shall conform to the provisions of this chapter. 
(g)  When a legal-nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, it shall thereafter conform to regulations of the district, the legal-nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(h)  Where a legal-nonconforming use applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming structure of the land. Destruction is defined as damage of more than 66 percent of its fair market value at the time of destruction. 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05) 
Sec. 90-8.6. - Nonconforming signs. 
    Any sign lawfully existing on the effective date of this chapter, or amendment thereto, that does not conform to all the standards and regulations of this chapter is considered a legal-nonconforming sign. The following applies to legal-nonconforming signs. 
(a)  All legal-nonconforming signs shall be kept in good repair, safe, neat, clean and attractive condition. In the event nonconforming signs are not kept in said condition or are demolished by any force whatsoever to the extent of 50 percent or more of the fair market value of the sign structure, said signs shall then be made to conform to the zoning ordinance. 
(b)  A sign face shall be removed by the owner or lessee of the premises upon which the sign is located when the business which it advertises is no longer conducted on the premises. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign face, the plan commission or director of community development shall give the owner 30 days written notice to remove it. Upon failure to comply with this notice, the plan commission or director of community development may remove the sign face at cost to the property owner or lessee. 
(c)  Legal-nonconforming signs which are structurally altered by a change to their height or bulk, relocated, or replaced shall comply immediately with all provisions of the zoning ordinance. Structural alterations which decrease the nonconformance of the sign or are required due to right-of-way acquisition are permitted. 
(d)  If a legal-nonconforming sign is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months, the sign shall conform to the provisions of this zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05; Ord. No. 13-13, §§ 2, 3, 7-2-13) 
Sec. 90-8.7. - Nonconforming telecommunication facilities. 
(a)  [Compliance with standards.] Telecommunication facilities in existence on or before September 16, 1998, which do not conform to or comply with the telecommunication facility standards are considered legal-nonconforming if: 
(1)  The telecommunications facility was covered by a building permit or variance on September 16, 1998, if one was required under applicable law; or 
(2)  If no building permit was required under applicable law for the telecommunications facility in question, the telecommunications facility had legal nonconforming status at such time. 
(b)  [Unlawful status.] Any nonconforming telecommunication facility in existence and that does not fit the definition of a legal-nonconforming telecommunications facility is an unlawful telecommunications facility. 
(c)  [Annexations.] If land is annexed to the city subsequent to September 16, 1998, any telecommunications facility upon such annexation which does not conform to the telecommunication facility standards at such time shall have legal-nonconforming status if: 
(1)  Under applicable federal, state and county regulations, the telecommunications facility was legal in all respects immediately prior to annexation; and 
(2)  The annexation was not conditioned upon the removal or modification of the telecommunications facility. 
(d)  Loss of legal-nonconforming status. Legal-nonconforming telecommunications facility shall immediately lose its legal nonconforming status if: 
(1)  The telecommunications facility, because of improper installation or maintenance, constitutes a threat to public health or safety and remains in such condition after a reasonable time is given to remedy the problem; 
(2)  The telecommunications facility is demolished or damaged to the extent of 50 percent or more of its value; 
(3)  The permit, variance or condition under which the telecommunications facility was allowed expires; or 
(4)  The telecommunications facility is substantially structurally altered so as to prolong its expected life. 
On the happening of any one of the above-listed events, the telecommunications facility shall be immediately brought into conformance with the development standards in this chapter or shall be removed. 
(e)  Nothing in the telecommunication facility standards shall relieve the owner or user of a legal-nonconforming telecommunications facility or owner of the property on which the legal-nonconforming telecommunications facility is located from any provisions regarding safety, maintenance and repair of the telecommunications facility. 
(Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-2-05)
