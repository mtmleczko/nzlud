PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Albany, Georgia. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1975 Code, the 1985 Code as supplemented through Ord. No. 07-111, adopted April 24, 2007, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of city commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, the 1985 Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jim Jenkins, Code Attorney, and Shelly Hayes, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Alfred D. Lott and city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Editor's note- Printed herein is the Charter of the City of Albany, as enacted by 1923 Ga. Laws (Act No. 303), page 370. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Any provisions regarding the severability, repealer, jurat, affidavit or notice of publication, publication date, or the adoption or effective date of the ordinance or Act have been omitted. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. The style used for headings and catchlines has been made uniform and consistent with those appearing in the Code. Additions made for clarity, such as consistent state statute citations and catchline modifications, are indicated by brackets. Each section of the original Act began with the prefatory language "[b]e it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, and it is hereby enacted by authority of the same," or "[b]e it further enacted that." At the editor's discretion, this prefatory language has been omitted from this printing.

    The term "commission year" as used herein means the period commencing on the second Monday in January of the year, and terminating on the second Monday of January of the following year. 
    In the event any commissioner declines to serve as mayor pro tem, then the commissioner next in line shall succeed to the position of mayor pro tem. 
(a)  Applicability; regular elections. The mayor and the three commissioners from the first, fourth, and sixth wards in office on January 1, 1999, shall complete the two-year terms for which they were elected on the second Monday in January, 2000, and when their successors are elected and qualified.

No person shall be eligible to represent any ward unless he has been a bona fide resident thereof at least three months prior to the election at which he offers himself as a candidate. If any commissioner shall remove his domicile from his ward during his term of office, this shall operate to cause a vacancy in the office of commissioner from that ward. The mayor and mayor pro tem. may reside in any ward.

If, however, said unexpired term is longer than six months from the date of such vacancy, the board shall, within 15 days, order an election, and such election shall be held and managed in the same manner as hereinafter provided for said elections, at which special election a successor for the unexpired term caused by said vacancy shall be elected.

The mayor pro tem shall have a voice in all proceedings before the board, and shall have a vote in each and all matters whatsoever. 
    A member of the board of city commissioners shall be incompetent to hold any other municipal office during the term of office for which he was chosen: Provided, that nothing herein shall render him ineligible to be elected during said term, to serve in a term immediately succeeding said term, but nothing in this section shall apply to any municipal office which is filled by appointment of the mayor. 
    The mayor shall be recognized as the official head of the city by the courts for the purposes of service of process and by the Governor and Federal authorities, for military and ceremonial functions. 
    In time of danger or emergency, the mayor may, with consent of two commissioners, take command of the police and govern the city by proclamation and maintain order and enforce laws.

If said veto is overruled, the budget shall stand as adopted; if said veto shall not be so overruled, said budget shall stand as if passed without the item vetoed. 
(e)  Salaries. Each member of the board of commissioners of the City of Albany, except the mayor, shall receive a salary of $15,000.00 per annum, payable in monthly installments on the first day of each month.

    All valid ordinances of the City of Albany existing and in force at the date upon which this Act takes effect with reference to procedure before the mayor and council shall continue of force and apply where applicable to procedure before the board until by the board altered or repealed. Each commissioner shall before qualifying and entering upon the discharge of his duties take and subscribe upon the minutes of the board the following oath, to-wit: 
    I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully and uprightly demean myself as a member of the board of city commissioners of the City of Albany during my continuance in office; that I will to the utmost of my skill and ability promote the interest and prosperity of the city, and that I will not willfully and knowingly use or be the cause of using tyrannical means toward any citizen or portions of citizens of the city, so help me God. 
(g)  Impeachment. The board of city commissioners shall provide by ordinance for the impeachment and trial of any member of the board, who upon conviction of malpractice in office or any willful neglect or abuse the powers and duties of the same, shall be dismissed from office.

Supp. 137 (M.D. Ga. 1977), the Albany board of commissioners was ordered to consist of seven commissioners, six of whom would reside in and be elected only by the voters of each of the six wards as reapportioned in the manner according to the court's six-ward plan, and one of whom would be the mayor. The commissioner would be able to reside anywhere in the city and would be elected by all the voters of the city. The office of mayor pro-tem, if deemed necessary and desirable by the commissioners, would be filled by vote of all the commissioners with a term of "one year and until his successor [was] elected and qualified." The court retained jurisdiction of this case.

Editor's note- 1974 Ga. Laws, p. 4017, § 1 (Ord. No. 1901, § I, 7-24-1973), purported to amend section 25(13) of the original Act by adding text to the end of it. However, the editor has determined that a scrivener's error occurred in listing which material of the original Act was meant to be amended by the amending ordinance, because section 25 of the original Act did not contain any sub-paragraphs and sub-paragraph (13) of section 24 of the original Act contained a similar subject matter as the amending material appearing in amending ordinance. Thus, at the editor's discretion, sub-paragraph (13) of section 24 has been amended by the provision appearing in 1974 Ga. Laws, p. 4017, § 1 (Ord. No. 1901, § I, 7-24-1973).

(a)  Authorized. The board of city commissioners may, in the interest of public health, safety, order, convenience, comfort, prosperity, or general welfare, adopt by ordinance a plan or plans for the districting or zoning of the city for the purpose of regulating the location of trades, industries, apartment-houses, dwellings, or other uses of property; or for the purpose of regulating the height of the buildings, fences, or other structures; or the area or dimensions of lots or of the yards used in connection with buildings or other structures; or for the purpose of regulating the alignment of buildings or other structures near street frontages.

The city may be divided into such number of zones or districts, and such districts may be of such shape and area as the board of city commissioners shall deem best suited to accomplish the purposes of the zoning regulations. In the determination and establishment of districts and regulations, classifications may be based on the nature or character of the trade, industry, profession, or other activity conducted, or to be conducted, upon the premises; the number of persons, families, or other group units to reside in or use buildings; the public, quasi-public, or private nature of the use of premises; or upon any other basis or bases relevant to the promotion of the public health, safety, order, morals, conveniences, prosperity, or welfare. 
(b)  Five-sevenths vote of board required for adoption, majority for repeal.

(c)  Rights of parties to pending litigation protected. Nothing in section 3 of this Act shall prejudice the rights of parties now in litigation as to their right to building permits, nor the rights of parties who have applied to the building inspector or the commissioners of the City of Albany for building permits prior to the passage of this Act, such parties being protected in their legal rights as they existed up to the passage of this Act. 
(9)  Sewers; extension of gas, water, etc. To construct or extend sewers in any of the streets, alleys or ways of said city or contiguous territory that may hereafter be incorporated, to assess such part of the cost of the same on the real estate abutting in the street, way or alley in which the same may be extended, according to frontage as may seem just and reasonable, and to enforce the payment of same by execution against the abutting real estate and the owner thereof. Before the board of [city] commissioners shall adopt any ordinance providing for said improvements where part of the cost is to be assessed against the property owner as above provided, written notice of the date and time of the meeting of the public works committee of the board of [city] commissioners at which such ordinance will be considered shall be given each affected property owner by mailing said notice to the address of such property owner as shown on the last city property tax return of such property owner, such notice to be placed in the United States mail at least 30 days prior to said meeting. The mailing of the notice above described in the manner above provided shall constitute sufficient notice. If the ordinance providing for such improvements shall receive the unanimous vote of the board of [city] commissioners, and if the board of city commissioners shall not elect to hold the cost of such improvement in abeyance and collect it as a sewer connection charge as hereafter provided, the consent of the property owners shall not be required as a condition to the construction of said improvements or to the assessment of the property owners for the cost or portions of the cost thereof; but if such ordinance shall not receive the unanimous vote of the board of [city] commissioners, the consent of 51 percent or more of the property owners to be assess shall be required. 
In determining whether the requisite 51 percent or more of the property owners to be assessed has been obtained, an affirmative expression of such consent must be received in writing, signed by the property owner. 
Said assessments shall be levied only on real estate which is specially benefited by the sewer; that is, on real estate which does not abut any street, alley, or way which already has a sewer capable of adequately serving said real estate, so that where there is "already a sewer in a street, alley or way, abutting any real estate, and said sewer is capable of adequately serving said real estate, the owner and said real estate shall not again be assessed for the construction or extension of a sewer, even though such sewer is constructed or extended in a street, alley or way abutting the real estate. The decision of the board of city commissioners as to adequacy shall be final. 
In determining whether or not 51 percent of the property owners have consented, property owners who will not be assessed on account of the foregoing paragraph shall be excluded and shall not be considered, effective from the date of the passage of the ordinance making the assessment, and having the same priority. 
To an execution issued under this paragraph the defendant shall have the right to file an affidavit, denying that the whole or any part of the amount for which execution issued is due and stating what amount he admits to be due; which shall be paid or collected before the affidavit is received, and the affidavit shall be received for the balance, and all such affidavits shall be returned to the Superior Court of Dougherty County and there be tried and determined as in cases of illegality, subject to all the pains and penalties provided for in such cases of illegality for delay. The executions herein provided shall be enforced as in case of executions for paving and the assessment shall have the same lien. 
And in all cases where street paving or repairing is contemplated on any street or highway in the city in which mains, sewers, gas pipes, or electric wiring pipes are laid, or are to be laid, the city shall have the power by a majority vote of the board of commissioners and without the consent of the property owners to extend such mains, sewers, gas pipes, or electric wiring pipes from the main line to the property line to thereafter avoid the necessity of tearing up the paving to make house connections and to assess and collect the cost of making such property line extension against the property to which said connection is made. The payment of such assessments shall be enforced in the manner in which assessments in cases of street paving are enforced. [parenthetical citation omitted] 
Whenever the construction or extension of a sanitary sewer does not receive the approval of 51 percent or more of the property owners to be assessed, and the unanimous vote of the board of city commissioners cannot be obtained to proceed with such construction or extension and to assess the same as heretofore provided, the board of city commissioners may nevertheless, by vote of four or more commissioners, order the sewer constructed or extended, and order the costs thereof to be apportioned and assessed against the abutting property owners in the same manner as herein provided in the case of other assessments, the payment thereof to be held in abeyance and collected as an additional sewer connection charge, in addition to all other connection charges and fees, at the time the property owner connects to the sewer. In such case execution shall issue and shall be recorded, and the assessment shall constitute the same lien as herein provided for other sewer construction and extension costs, dating from the adoption of the ordinance providing therefor, but payment shall not be required or demanded until the property owner connects to the sewer. The board of commissioners shall have the power to authorize payment of such costs, when the same becomes due upon connection to the system, in future installments and in such manner and at such rate of interest, not to exceed the maximum lawful rate, as it shall determine. In such case the costs shall continue to be a lien until paid in full, with all due interest. 
Provided, however, that if any lot or lots is so situated that the installation of the sewer line does not extend the full distance of the frontage of said lot or lots abutting the street, way, alley or easement, thereupon the city commissioners are authorized to assess the entire frontage of the lot or lots, the proportionate share of the costs of said sewer line, and provided further, that in such a case the sewer line shall be extended along frontage abutting street, way, alley or easement, to such a point as will afford the owner of the real estate the most practical and economical connection to the sewer line. [parenthetical citation omitted] 
In addition to all other authority which the City of Albany has to construct or extend sanitary sewers and to provide for the recovery of the cost thereof, the City of Albany shall have the right, by a majority vote of the board of commissioners (four votes), without the consent of the property owners, to construct or extend sanitary sewers, and to recover the cost of construction through tapping fees, to be computed as follows: 
The director of the public works department shall keep an accurate record of the cost of construction of such sanitary sewer line, and, upon completion, shall make an official determination of the entire cost thereof. Every person desiring to tap on to said line and receive service therefrom shall pay, at the time of tapping on, a tapping fee which shall be the greater of the following sums: 
(1)  A fraction of the entire cost of construction as finally determined by the public works director, the enumerator of which shall be the number of feet of property owned by said user abutting on said sanitary sewer line, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the front footage of property abutting both sides of the sanitary sewer line; or 
(2)  A fraction of such construction cost, the enumerator of which shall be the estimated demand upon such line by the user in terms of gallons per minute, as determined by or under the direction of the public works director, and the denominator of which shall be the total capacity of said sanitary sewer line in terms of gallons per minute, as determined by the public works director.

Editor's note- Subsection 2 of the original Act was declared unconstitutional by the Georgia Supreme Court in Reynolds v. Brosnan, 170 Ga. 773, 154 S.E. 264 (1930). Nevertheless, the text of the subsection has been included in this printing for purposes of authenticity. In addition, 1970 Ga. Laws (Act No. 986), p. 2575, § I, purported to strike the text of sub-paragraph (5) of section 35 of the original Act and replace it with a new sub-paragraph (5). However, the editor has determined that a scrivener's error occurred in describing which material of the original Act was meant to be amended by the 1970 Act, because section 35 of the original Act did not contain any sub-paragraphs and sub-paragraph (5) of section 34 of the original Act contained a similar subject matter as the amending material appearing in 1970 Act. Thus, at the editor's discretion, sub-paragraph (5) of section 34 has been amended by the provision appearing in 1970 Ga. Laws (Act No. 986), p. 2575, § I. Furthermore, the Georgia Assembly enacted the provisions of 1929 Ga. Laws (Act No. 245), p. 797, § 3, as amending the original Act, but they did not list any specific location for these amendatory provisions within the original Act relative to the other sections. Placement of these amendatory provisions and designation of them as subsections (8-A)(a)-(c) of section 34 was at the discretion of the editor. Furthermore, the Georgia Assembly enacted a provision of 1941 Ga. Laws (Act No. 24), p. 1010, § 2, as amending section 34 of the original Act, but they did not list any specific location for this amendatory provision within the original Act relative to the other subsections. Placement of this amendatory provision and designation of it as subsection (15) of section 34 was at the discretion of the editor. Moreover, the Georgia Assembly enacted a provision of 1964 Ga. Laws (Act No. 521), p. 2009, § 1 as a new subsection under section 34 of the original Act, but they did not provide any specific designation for this new subsection within the original Act relative to the other 15 subsections existing at that time. The General Assembly later repealed and replaced this provision with another through Ord. No. 80-109, § 1, adopted 2-12-80 (1981 Ga. Laws (Act No. 521), p. 5046, § 1), but designated the new provision as subsection 22 of section 34. Furthermore, the Georgia Assembly enacted a provision of Ord. No. 1869, § 1, adopted May 22, 1973 (1974 Ga. Laws, p. 4009, § 1) as an amendment to section 34 of the original Act, and only designated that it be numbered as subsection 18, "or the number next following the last number of said section 34 as amended." Designation of this amendatory provision as subsection (21) of section 34 was at the discretion of the editor. 
Sec. 35. - Levy and sale of property outside corporate limits. 
    In any case where the defendant in execution has no property within the City of Albany, then and in that event any execution issued by authority of the city for the enforcement of the payment of any sum for taxes, special assessments, fines or otherwise, may be levied and enforced in any county in the state in which property of the defendant may be found and for such purpose the mayor or treasurer shall cause such execution to be directed to any sheriff or constable of the state, and it shall be the duty of any levying officer into whose hands said execution may be placed to promptly enforce the same in the same manner as other executions are enforced with reference to levy, advertisement and sale. 
Sec. 36. - Municipal abattoirs; inspection of meats. 
    The City of Albany shall have power and authority to own and operate for reasonable profit a municipal abattoir at any place within its corporate limits proper, or its police jurisdiction, to fix and collect regular fees for the slaughter of cattle, hogs, sheep or other meat intended for human consumption therein; to prescribe any and all regulations and rules governing the operation of said abattoir and the reception of stock therein, and in connection with the operation of same shall have the power to fully regulate or prohibit any other abattoir or slaughter house or similar place where cattle or other meat is slaughtered for market within its corporate and police limits, and to prescribe the location and the manner and kind of construction of the same; or said city shall have the power to prohibit the operation of any abattoir, slaughter house or other place where stock is slaughtered within the corporate and police limits; and in connection with the said municipal abattoir, said city shall have the power to prohibit by penal ordinance the sale or having on hand for sale, within its corporate or police limits, any fresh or green meats, not slaughtered in its abattoir, unless it has been slaughtered in an abattoir or similar place of equal facilities and methods as that of the city's or of such standard as the city may by ordinance prescribe, or unless it bears valid and satisfactory evidence of a state or federal favorable inspection; and said city shall have the power to provide for rigid inspection of all green or fresh meats sold or offered for sale or on hand for sale, within the city's corporate or police limits, so as to insure a strict conformity to its laws and ordinances governing the introduction thereof into the city; and shall have the power to confiscate and destroy all tainted meats found on the market of the city, and to confiscate all meats found within said limits brought in contrary to the laws and ordinances of the city. 
Sec. 37. - Enumeration of powers not restrictive. 
    The enumeration of power contained in this Act shall not be construed as restrictive, but the City of Albany and its municipal authorities may exercise all powers, rights and jurisdictions as they might if such enumerations were not made, and the board of city commissioners may pass all laws and ordinances, rules and regulations they may deem needful and proper for the general welfare of said city, and where, under this charter, rights are conferred or powers granted, but the manner of exercising them is not fully prescribed the board of city commissioners may prescribe the method of exercising them, or they may prescribe additional regulations and modes of procedure not repugnant to the intents and purposes of this Act, nor the laws of the state. 
Sec. 37-A. - Municipal planning board. 
(a)  Creation; composition. There shall be created as part of the government of the City of Albany a board to be known as the municipal planning board, which board shall consist of not less than three and not more than seven members, to be appointed by the board of city commissioners and to have such terms (not to exceed four years) as the board of city commissioners may determine. The board shall elect one of its members chairman and shall appoint a Secretary, who may be an employee of the city. 
(b)  Powers; duties. The planning board shall have power to recommend or make suggestions to the board of city commissioners concerning the laying out, widening, extending and location of streets; sidewalks, and boulevards; the relief of traffic conditions; development of housing and sanitary conditions; and the establishment of zones or districts, to make suggestions concerning the use, height, area and bulk of buildings or structures; to study and propose such measures as may be advisable for the promotion of public interests, health, morals, safety, comfort, convenience and welfare of said city, and in addition thereto, shall have such additional authority as may be provided by law, or conferred upon said board by ordinances passed by the board of city commissioners of the City of Albany. 
(c)  Appropriation; gifts or bequests. The board of city commissioners shall make such appropriations for carrying out the work of said planning board in like manner and form as appropriations are made to other departments of said city.

(1924 Ga. Laws (Act No. 331), p. 397, § 3; 1949 Ga. Laws (Act No. 27), p. 103, § 1) 
Editor's note- The Georgia legislature enacted the provisions of 1924 Ga. Laws (Act No. 331), p. 397, § 3, as amending the original 1923 Act without reference to a specific location relative to the other sections of the original 1923 Act. Placement of these provisions at Section 37-A this location, was at the discretion of the editor. This planning board has been succeeded by the Albany-Dougherty Planning commission, which was established by Ordinance No. 85-167, adopted May 30, 1985. 
Sec. 38. - Act of 1906 not repealed. 
    All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act be and the same are hereby repealed; Provided, that nothing in this Act contained shall operate to effect or repeal the Act of the General Assembly of Georgia, approved August 21, 1906, entitled "An Act to provide for a system of public schools in and for the City of Albany, Dougherty County, Georgia; to empower and require the mayor and council of said city to levy and collect a special tax for the maintenance and support of same; to establish a board of education to conduct the same; to define the powers of said board; to provide for ratification of the Act by election, and for other purposes," which said Act is hereby declared to be and remain of full force and effect [1906 Ga. Laws (Act No. 548), p. 488]. 
Sec. 39. - Election for ratification of charter. 
    Before this Act shall become effective the same shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the City of Albany at an election to be held for that purpose on October 8, 1923. Said election shall in all respects be held and the results declared by the mayor and council or by those discharging the duties of such, under the present rules and regulations governing ordinary city elections, provided that instead of opening the registration books 45 days prior to said election said registration books need not be opened more than 35 days prior to said election and continue open for 30 days. Those so registering and qualified to vote in said election need not register again in order to vote in the general election to be held in said city on the first Monday in December, 1923 (or any primary election therefor), but if otherwise qualified shall be deemed qualified voters in said general election. Those voters desiring to vote in favor of this Act shall have written or printed upon their ballots the words "For Commission Manager Bill," and those voters desiring to vote against this bill shall have written or printed on their ballots "Against Commission Manager Bill." If a majority of those voting in said election shall vote in favor of this bill, this bill shall, as to those Acts and things, the performance or happening of which is postponed until that date, become of force and effect on the second Monday in January, 1924, and, as to those Acts and things the performance or happening of which is required prior to said second Monday in January, 1924, shall become of force and effect at such time or times as will insure the prompt performance or happening of said Acts and things. 
(a)  The managers and clerks of said special election (and one alternate for each to serve in case the person designated does not act) shall be chosen by the mayor and council of the city, or those discharging the duties of such, at least three days before the election, and those favoring the adoption of the Act and those opposed thereto shall have as nearly equal representation among said managers and clerks as is possible; that is to say, if two managers are chosen from among those who favor the adoption of said Act, then two of the clerks shall be chosen from among those opposed thereto, and vice versa. And in choosing said clerks and managers, and alternates for each, said authorities shall as far as possible act upon responsible recommendations made by the chairman or committee of those citizens favoring the adoption of said Act and the chairman or committee of those citizens opposing the adoption of said Act. 
Sec. 39-A. - Retirement age for municipal employees. 
    Every employed municipal officer or employee of the City of Albany shall be retired upon reaching 65 years of age; provided, that in the event municipal employees are included under the provisions of the United States Social Security Act, no municipal officer or employee who is employed at the time of such inclusion shall be retired at the age of 65 if such retirement would disqualify such person from obtaining the benefits of social security. Instead, such employee shall be allowed to continue his employment until he qualifies for social security at which time he shall be retired. 
(1956 Ga. Laws (Act No. 252), p. 2762, § 1) 
Editor's note- The requirement in Section 39-A mandating a retirement age for all municipal officers and employees is a prima facie violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. However, the text of this section has been printed for purposes of authenticity. 
Sec. 40. - Authority to insure city employees; appropriation of funds. 
    The City of Albany shall have the power and authority to enter into contracts of insurance with any insurance company authorized to transact business in the State of Georgia, insuring the employees of the city, or any class or group of city employees, under a policy or policies of group insurance, granting annuities, hospital and sick insurance.

(1950 Ga. Laws (Act No. 595), p. 2149, § 1) 
Editor's note- The Georgia legislature enacted the provisions of 1950 Ga. Laws (Act No. 595), p. 2149, § 1, as a new section amending the original 1923 Act without reference to a specific location relative to the other sections of the original 1923 Act. Placement of the provision at this location and designation of it as Section 40, was at the discretion of the editor. Section 40 of the original 1923 Act provided for the repeal of all conflicting laws. 
Sec. 41. - Board of city commissioners to determine type of insurance; amount, etc. 
    The board of city commissioners is hereby vested with full and complete power and authority to determine the amount of contribution by the city for the purchase of group insurance for employees of the city, the amount and kind of insurance, what class of employees are to be included, and to determine any and all facts relating to the purchase of group insurance, and to enter into contracts accordingly. 
(1950 Ga. Laws (Act No. 595), p. 2149, § 2) 
Editor's note- The Georgia legislature enacted the provisions of 1950 Ga. Laws (Act No. 595), p. 2149, § 2, as a new section amending the original 1923 Act and following the section enacted by section 1 of the 1950 Act. Designation of it as Section 41, was at the discretion of the editor. Furthermore, 1981 Ga. Laws, pp. 5048, 5049, § 1 (Ord. No. 80-117, § 1, 2-26-1980) purported to amend the Charter and 1943 Ga. Laws (Act No. 105), p. 1154, by adding an amendatory provision allowing "the transfer to the City of Albany Pension Fund of the interest or equity of any newly employed city manager in any and all other employee pension trusts or funds." However, the original 1923 Act creating the Charter did not contain any amendatory provision from the 1943 Act or any subject matter concerning municipal employee pensions. Therefore, the provisions of the 1981 amendatory ordinance were not included in this printing of the Charter, at the discretion of the editor.

Editor's note- 1975 Ga. Laws (Act No. 211), p. 3172, § 1, purported to enact a new paragraph at the end of subsection (b) of section 2 of the 1958 Ga. Laws (Act No. 260), p. 2870. However, the editor has determined that a scrivener's error occurred regarding which section of the 1958 Act the new paragraph should be added, because section 2 of the 1958 Act does not contain any subsections while section 3 of the 1958 Act contains subsections (a)-(c). Therefore, the new paragraph added by the 1975 Act was placed at the end of subsection (c) of section 3, at the discretion of the editor. Moreover, 1979 Ga. Laws (Act No. 182), p. 3639, § 1, purported to enact a new paragraph at the end of subsection (b) of section 2 of the 1958 Ga. Laws (Act No. 260), p. 2870. However, the editor has determined that a scrivener's error occurred regarding which section of the 1958 Act the new paragraph should be added, because section 2 of the 1958 Act does not contain any subsections while section 3 of the 1958 Act contains subsections (a)-(c). Therefore, the new paragraph added by the 1979 Act was placed at the end of subsection (c) of section 3, at the discretion of the editor.

In case any officer whose signature shall appear on the bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before delivery of such bonds, such signature shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until delivery, and such bonds may, nevertheless, be issued and delivered as though the person who signed or sealed such bonds had not ceased to be such officer, and any of such bonds may be executed and sealed on behalf of said Authority by such officers who may, at the time of the execution of such bonds, hold the proper offices of said Authority although on the date of such bonds or on the date of any lawful proceedings taken in connection therewith such persons may not have held such offices. 
(d)  All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall be and are hereby declared to be negotiable under the laws of the State of Georgia, subject to provisions for registration. 
(e)  The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the Authority and the proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds shall be used solely for the purpose provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds. 
(f)  Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. 
(g)  The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds and coupons which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. 
(h)  Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified required hereunder. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions hereof shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the Authority. 
(i)  The revenue bonds or obligations herein authorized to be issued shall not be deemed to constitute a debt (within the meaning of Article IX, Section VII, Paragraph I of the Constitution of the State of Georgia of 1976) of the State of Georgia, the City of Albany, the County of Dougherty, or the Authority, or a pledge of the faith and credit of said State, City, County, nor shall said State, City, or County be subject to any pecuniary liability thereon. 
(j)  In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the Authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies; and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds; and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other monies be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State or of the United States to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. Any resolution adopted by the Authority or any indenture of trust, trust agreement, or other instrument executed by the Authority may contain such terms and provisions as the Authority shall approve. Such approval of the Authority shall be conclusively established by the execution of any such resolution, indenture of trust, trust agreement, or other instrument by the chairman or vice chairman of the Authority and the attestation of such execution by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Authority. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture.

The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another.

Sec. 2-279. - Purpose. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Abusive language means harsh, violent, profane, or derogatory language that would demean the dignity of an individual, including profanity, racial, ethnic, and sexist slurs.

(b)  Established. There is hereby established a police department civilian review board ("civilian review board") to exercise the duties and responsibilities outlined herein so that there will be a procedure to review certain complaints against law enforcement officers of the city. No member of the civilian review board shall receive any remuneration for their service. 
(c)  Accountability. Accountability is perhaps the most important function of local government. This civilian review board is designed to induce confidence in the citizens of Albany concerning the operation of the police officers employed by the city. 
(d)  Review of policies and complaints. The civilian review board will address police department policies with a view toward recommendations to the chief of police and will review, when request is made, complaints of: 
(1)  Abusive language; 
(2)  Excessive force; and

Sec. 2-281. - Duties and functions. 
(a)  The civilian review board will provide a process to review certain claims that have been made against members of the city police department. The present process can be summarized as follows: 
(b)  The police department presently responds to citizens' complaints by having the complaint investigated by the appropriate supervisor. Once the supervisor reaches a conclusion, the supervisor's determination makes it way through the appropriate chain of command/division head. The command staff of the police department then reviews the matter. At any point in the process, an investigation can be made beyond that conducted by the supervisor or the chief of police can refer a complaint to the internal affairs office of the police department. Upon completion of the investigation, the complaining party is notified by the city police department, via telephone, e-mail or letter of its findings. 
(c)  Given that the purpose of this board is to assure accountability to the citizens of the city, the city commission has made the decision to structure a process for further review of complaints arising out of alleged abusive language, excessive force, and harassment. If an individual feels like their complaint was not properly handled, then within 30 days of the police department's having made its decision, the complaining party must complete an Allegation of Employee Misconduct Form and mail it to: 
Police department Civilian Review Board 
c/o City Manager 
P.O. Box 447 
Albany, Georgia 31702-0447 
(d)  The form is available at the city's website www.albany.ga.us; at the information desk, city police department; and at each of the four police precincts. Upon receipt of such form, the city manager will promptly forward copies to each member of the civilian review board. The civilian review board shall look into the matter and make one of the following recommendations to the chief of police: 
(1)  Ask the chief of police to forward the matter to the internal affairs division for further investigation. 
(2)  Recommend to the police chief that the actions of the police officer were appropriate under the circumstances at issue. 
(3)  Recommend to the police chief that the actions of the police officer were not appropriate under the circumstances at issue. 
(e)  The civilian review board will mail a copy of its recommendation to the complaining party. 
(f)  As far as the civilian review board is concerned, the chief of police has the ultimate decision making authority concerning appropriate discipline for members of the police department. 
(Code 1985, § 2-173; Ord. No. 05-108, § 1, 4-26-2005) 
Sec. 2-282. - Powers and records. 
(a)  It is appropriate for the civilian review board itself to look into the matter or it may appoint three of its members to an inquiry panel (panel) to conduct an appropriate inquiry. The approach taken by the civilian review board (or panel) may be to address the complainant and/or the officer at issue. Additionally, the civilian review board (or panel) may want to request the attendance of witnesses. The officer who is the subject of a complaint shall be expected to appear even if such officer is off duty at the time of such appearance. Such officer shall be paid his or her normal rate of compensation. The civilian review board recognizes the right of anyone to bring counsel with them and the civilian review board may make use of the services of the city attorney. If the matter is handled through an inquiry panel, then that panel shall upon completion of its work, make a report to the civilian review board. 
(b)  Minutes shall be kept of any hearings/meetings whether conducted by the civilian review board or by an inquiry panel. The civilian review board is urged to appoint a new panel each time one is used.

Sec. 2-714. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  It is the purpose of this article to prohibit the mayor, each individual commissioner and other officers and employees, elected or appointed, whether paid or unpaid, from engaging in any business, employment or transactions; rendering services; or having contractual, financial or other private interests, direct or indirect, which are in conflict with, or could reasonably appear to be in conflict with the proper discharge of their official duties or the best interest of the city, or which would tend to impair independency and objectivity of judgment or action in the performance of official duties.

It is not the intention of this article to establish a secret board for the purpose of undertaking investigations, or rendering opinions on any matters not specifically presented to the board in writing as herein provided; but on the contrary, it is the express intention of this article in the creation of the board of ethics to make government better so that the public may benefit therefrom, and at the same time to protect those people who have a bona fide question of conflict; and with the same it is the expressed and avowed intention in requiring the board of ethics to hold private hearings and to publish its advisory opinions with such deletions as to names of parties and other matters involved, so that those matters of private interest and concern shall remain private and personal unless and until such time as it is made to appear that such personal and private interest is in conflict with government duty to the detriment of the public.

Secs. 2-731-2-760. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS 

Sec. 2-761. - Introduction. 
(a)  This policy is only applicable to city employees, appointed city officials, agents and contractors of the city, but is not applicable to any elected officials. The code of business conduct and ethics helps ensure compliance with legal requirements and standards of business conduct for the city. All city employees are expected to read and understand this code of business conduct and ethics, uphold these standards in day to day activities, comply with all applicable policies and procedures, and ensure that all agents and contractors are aware of, understand and adhere to these standards. This policy recognizes that in determining ethical conduct, an employee or appointed official must bear in mind that he or she may have to also comply with additional standards. For example, an employee or official may be a member of a professional organization that places additional or higher constraints on individual conduct. 
(b)  Because the principles described in this code of business conduct and ethics are general in nature, employees should also review all applicable city policies and procedures for more specific instruction and contact the human resources department or city attorney's office if you have any questions. 
(c)  This code of business conduct and ethics, city policies and procedures, and/or other related communications (verbal or written) do not create or imply an employment contract or term of employment. 
(d)  The city is committed to continuously reviewing and updating city policies and procedures. Therefore, this code of business conduct and ethics is subject to modification. This code of business conduct and ethics supersedes all other such codes, policies, procedures, instructions, practices, rules or written or verbal representations to the extent they are inconsistent. 
(Ord. No. 08-134, § 1(1.1), 8-26-2008) 
Sec. 2-762. - Compliance is everyone's business. 
(a)  Ethical business conduct is critical to services the city provides to the citizens of the city. City employees are expected to closely examine this document and adhere to these practices. Many of these practices reflect legal or regulatory requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations can create significant liability for the employee, the city including department directors, other employees, and elected-officials. It is the job of employees and their ethical responsibility to help enforce this code of business conduct and ethics. Employees should be alert to and report possible violations in accordance with the whistleblower policy which sets forth: 
(b)  Any report may be made anonymously and must be made in one of the following ways: 
(1)  By contacting the supervisor; 
(2)  By contacting the city's human resources or city attorney; 
(3)  By calling the city's compliance officer or city hotline at or on-line at www.albany.ga.us; as established by the city's human resources office; 
(4)  By mail to: 
The City Compliance Officer 
Human Resources Department 
P.O. Box 447, Albany, GA, 31702-0447 
(c)  Employees must cooperate in any internal or external investigations of possible violations. Reprisal, threats, retribution or retaliation against any person who has in good faith reported a violation or a suspected violation of law of this code of business conduct or other city policies, or against any person who is assisting in any investigation or process with respect to such a violation, is prohibited. The city has a more detailed set of guidelines with respect to reporting violations. Employees are expected to review, understand and follow such policies and procedures. 
(d)  Violations of law, this code of business conduct and ethics, or other city policies or procedures may lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
(e)  In all cases, if you are unsure about the appropriateness of an event or action, please seek assistance in interpreting the requirements of these practices by contacting the city attorney's office. 
(Ord. No. 08-134, § 1(1.2), 8-26-2008) 
Sec. 2-763. - Employee's responsibilities to the city and its citizen. 
(a)  General standards of conduct. The City of Albany expects all employees, agents and contractors to exercise good judgment to ensure the safety and welfare of employees, agents and contractors and to maintain a cooperative, efficient, positive, harmonious and productive work environment and business organization. These standards apply while working on city premises, at offsite locations where city business is being conducted, at city sponsored business and social events, or at any other place where employees represent the City of Albany. Employees, agents or contractors who engage in misconduct or whose performance is unsatisfactory may be subject to corrective action, up to and including termination. 
(b)  Applicable laws. All city employees, agents and contractors must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, rules and regulatory orders. Each employee, agent and contractor must acquire appropriate knowledge of the requirements relating to his or her duties sufficient to enable him or her to recognize potential dangers and to know when to seek advice from the city's compliance officer or city attorney's office on specific city policies and procedures. Violations of laws, regulations, rules and orders may subject the employee, agent or contractor to individual criminal or civil liability, as well as to discipline by the city. Such individual violations may also subject the city to civil and/or criminal liability. 
(c)  Conflicts of interest. Each employee has a responsibility to the city, citizens and each other. Although this duty does not prevent employees from engaging in personal transactions and investments, it does demand avoidance of situations where a conflict of interest might occur or appear to occur. The city is subject to scrutiny from many different individuals and organizations; therefore, employees should always strive to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. 
(1)  Interest and benefit to one person, not the city. A conflict of interest exists where the interests or benefits of one person or entity conflict with the interests or benefits of the city. Examples include: 
a.  Employment/outside employment. In consideration of employment with the city, employees are expected to devote full attention to the business interests of the city and are prohibited from engaging in any activity that interferes with job performance or responsibilities to the city, its citizens or is otherwise in conflict with or prejudicial to the city. City policies prohibit any employee from accepting simultaneous employment with a city supplier, customer, or developer, or from taking part in any activity that adversely affects the city's competitive advantage. Additionally, employees must disclose to the city any interest that may conflict with the business of the city. Questions should be directed to the employee's immediate supervisor, the human resources department or city attorney's office. 
b.  Business interests. Employees considering investing in a city customer, supplier, developer or competitor, must first take great care to ensure that these investments do not compromise job responsibilities to the city. Many factors should be considered in determining whether a conflict exists, including the size and nature of the investment; ability to influence the city's decisions; access to confidential information of the city or of the other company; and the nature of the relationship between the city and the other company. Again, avoiding the appearance of impropriety or conflict. 
c.  Related parties. As a general rule, employees should avoid conducting city business with a relative or significant other, or with a business in which a relative or significant other is associated in any noteworthy role. Relatives include spouse, sister, brother, daughter, son, mother, father, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, step relationships, and in-laws. Significant others include persons living in a spousal (including same sex) or familial fashion with an employee. 
(2)  Full disclosure of nature of transaction. If such a related party transaction is unavoidable, the employee must fully disclose the nature of the related party transaction to the city attorney. If determined to be material to the city by the financial director, the city attorney must review and approve in writing in advance such related party transactions. The most significant related party transactions, particularly those involving the city's directors or executive officers, must be reviewed and approved in writing in advance by the city manager and city attorney. The city must report all such material related party transactions under applicable accounting rules, federal securities laws, SEC rules and regulations, and securities market rules. Any dealings with a related party must be conducted in such a way that no preferential treatment is given to this business. 
(3)  Disclosure of relatives of employees. The city discourages the employment of relatives and significant others in positions or assignments within the same department and prohibits the employment of such individuals in positions that have a financial dependence or influence (e.g., an auditing or control relationship, or a supervisor/subordinate relationship). The purpose of this policy is to prevent the organizational impairment and conflicts that are a likely outcome of the employment of relatives or significant others, especially in a supervisor/subordinate relationship. If a question arises about whether a relationship is covered by this policy, the human resources department is responsible for determining whether an applicant's or transferee's acknowledged relationship is covered by this policy. The human resources department shall advise all affected applicants and transferees of this policy. Willful withholding of information regarding a prohibited relationship/reporting arrangement may be subject to corrective action, up to and including termination. If a prohibited relationship exists or develops between two employees, the employee in the senior position must bring this to the attention of such employee's supervisor. The city retains the prerogative to separate the individuals at the earliest possible time, either by reassignment or by termination, if necessary. 
(4)  Other situations. Because other conflicts of interest may arise, it would be impractical to attempt to list all possible situations. If a proposed transaction or situation raises, any questions or doubts should be directed to the city attorney's office. This policy prohibits real and apparent conflicts of interest that may arise among appointed officials, employees, or agents. 
(d)  City opportunities. Employees, officers and directors may not exploit for their own personal gain opportunities that are discovered through the use of corporate property, information or position unless the opportunity is disclosed fully in writing to the city manager, that they decline to pursue such opportunity. 
(1)  Requests by regulatory authorities. The city and its employees, agents and contractors must cooperate with appropriate government inquiries and investigations. In this context, however, it is important to protect the legal rights of the city with respect to its confidential information. All government and public requests for information (open records request), documents or investigative interviews must be referred to the city attorney's office. No financial information may be disclosed without the prior approval of the city manager and city attorney's office. 
(2)  City's spokespeople. The city manager is the official spokes person for the city and has herein delegated that authority to department directors or others officially appointed to perform in the absence of the director. 
(e)  Use of city's assets. 
(1)  Generally. Protecting the city's assets is a key fiduciary responsibility of every employee, agent and contractor. Care should be taken to ensure that assets are not misappropriated, loaned to others, sold or donated, without appropriate authorization. All city employees, agents and contractors are responsible for the proper use of city assets, and must safeguard such assets against loss, damage, misuse or theft. Employees, agents or contractors who violate any aspect of this policy or who demonstrate poor judgment in the manner in which they use any city asset may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment at the city's sole discretion. city equipment and property (buildings and land) are assets to be used for city business purposes only. Employees, agents and contractors may not use city assets for personal use, nor may they allow any other person to use city assets. Employees who have any questions regarding this policy should bring them to the attention of the city's human resources department or city attorney's office. 
(2)  City funds. Every city employee is personally responsible for all city funds over which he or she exercises control. City agents and contractors should not be allowed to exercise control over company funds. City funds must be used only for city business purposes. Every city employee, agent and contractor must take reasonable steps to ensure that the city receives good value for city funds spent, and must maintain accurate and timely records of each and every expenditure. Expense reports must be accurate and submitted in a timely manner. City employees, agents and contractors must not use city funds for any personal purpose. 
(3)  Computers and other equipment. The city strives to furnish employees with the equipment necessary to efficiently and effectively do their jobs. It is the responsibility of employees to care for that equipment and use it responsibility and only for city business purposes. If city equipment is used at home or off site, take precautions to protect it from theft or damage, just as if it were your own. Once a person is no longer an employee of the city, all city property is to be immediately returned While computers and other electronic devices are made accessible to employees to assist them to perform their jobs and to promote the city's interests, all such computers and electronic devices, whether used entirely or partially on the city's premises or with the aid of the city's equipment or resources, must remain fully accessible to the city and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, will remain the sole and exclusive property of the city. Employees, agents and contractors should not maintain any expectation of privacy with respect to information transmitted over, received by, or stored in any electronic communications device owned, leased, or operated in whole or in part by or on behalf of the city. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the city retains the right to gain access to any information received by, transmitted by, or stored in any such electronic communications device, by and through its employees, agents, contractors, or representatives, at any time, either with or without an employees or third party's knowledge, consent or approval. 
(4)  Software. All software used by employees to conduct city business must be appropriately licensed. Never make or use illegal or unauthorized copies of any software, whether in the office, at home, or on the road, since doing so may constitute copyright infringement and may expose employees and the city to potential civil and criminal liability. In addition, use of illegal or unauthorized copies of software may subject the employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. The city's information technology department ("IT department") will inspect city computers periodically to verify that only approved and licensed software has been installed. Any nonlicensed/supported software will be removed. 
(5)  Frequent flyer miles. Mileage earned on city related travel are assigned to the individual and will be use to reduce future city travel by the individual. When the employee retires the miles will remain the property of the individual. 
(6)  City credit card usage. These cards are to be used for authorized city business only and receipts are to be maintained, signed as verification of accuracy and authorized expenditure. Once signed they are to be turned-in to department finance officers/accounts clerk for retention. Should a card be use by mistake for personal business, the error will be immediately reported to the employee's reporting senior, and a formal report will be made to include a check for repayment of the unauthorized transaction. Repeated misuse of card may result in suspension, loss of card privileges and/or termination. Questions regarding this policy should be directed to the city attorney's office. 
(7)  Prohibition of inducements. Under no circumstances may employees, agents or contractors offer to pay, make payment, promise to pay, or issue authorization to pay any money, gift, or anything of value to customers, vendors, consultants, etc., that is perceived as intended, directly or indirectly, to improperly influence any business decision, any act or failure to act, any commitment of fraud, or opportunity for the commission of any fraud.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 15-111, §§ 1, 2(Exh. A), adopted April 28, 2015, repealed the former article IV, §§ 4-71-4-81, and enacted a new article IV as set out herein. The former article IV pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 09-142, § 2(3-51-3-61), adopted December 15, 2009. 

Sec. 4-71. - Statement of purpose. 
    In adopting these sign regulations, it is the intent and purpose of the mayor and board of commissioners of the City of Albany not to impose an outright ban on signs, but instead to: 
(a)  Balance the right of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; and 
(b)  Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive land use planning; 
(c)  Protect the public health, safety and welfare; 
(d)  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
(e)  Maintain the historical and cultural heritage and image of the city; 
(f)  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
(g)  Avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
(h)  Promote economic development and tourism; 
(i)  Protect private property values; and 
(j)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
    In accessing how to go about the above described task, the mayor and board of commissioners have given considerable weight and find the following to be relevant and useful to the mayor and board of commissioners of the city concerning the size, location and quantity of sign structures within the city must be regulated in order to achieve the above-stated intents and purposes: University of Georgia Land Use Clinic (2003, June 26). Sign Control on Rural Corridors: Model Provisions and Guidance; Wisconsin Department of Transportation (1994, December). Milwaukee County Stadium Variable Message Sign Study: Impacts of an Advertising Variable Message Sign on Freeway Traffic; Scenic America (2007). Billboards in the Digital Age: Unsafe (and Unsightly) at Any Speed. Scenic America Issue Alert.; Nasar, Jack L. and Hong, Xiaodong (1999, September). Visual Preferences in Urban Signscapes. Journal of Environment and Behavior, 31(5), 671-691.; Office of Safety Research and Development, Federal Highway Administration (2001, September 11). Research Review of Potential Safety Effects of Electronic Billboards on Driver Attention and Distraction. U.S. Department of Transportation.; New York State Department of State, Division of Local Government Services (2006, January). Municipal Control of Signs. James A. Coon Local Government Technical Series.; Weinstein, Alan C. A Study of Local Regulation of Outdoor Advertising in 268 U.S. Jurisdictions.

Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, No. 1937, 105-112. 
    In adopting these sign regulations, the mayor and board of commissioners of the city have carefully considered and especially recognize the case law coming from Georgia courts, the federal courts, and courts throughout the United States, which recognize that the regulation of the size, location and quantity of sign structures is a valid and lawful means of achieving the above-stated intents and purposes, and that such intents and purposes are valid and lawful governmental interests, which include the following: Granite State Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga., 193 Fed. Appx. 900 (C.A.11th 2006) (finding that the stated goals within a sign ordinance of protecting against traffic hazards and the adverse impact on the county's aesthetic qualities are substantial government interests); Gregory v. Clive, 2007 WL 2914515 (Ga. S.Ct. 2007) (recognizing as within a local government's police power to enact legislation governing billboards and signs, as such legislation clearly addresses the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community); H & H Operations, Inc. v. City of Peachtree City, Ga., 248 Ga. 500 (1981) (holding that, under its police power, a municipality can enact and enforce reasonable regulations governing the erection and maintenance of signs within its jurisdiction); Harnish v. Manatee County, Florida, 783 F.2d 1535 (C.A. 11th 1986) (finding that aesthetics is a substantial governmental goal which is entitled to and should be according weighty respect, and that the governmental entity charged with the responsibility of protecting the environment must be given discretion in determining how much protection is necessary and the best method of achieving that protection); Lamar Advertising Company v. City of Douglasville, Ga., 254 F.Supp.2d 1321 (N.D.Ga. 2003) (finding that where a sign ordinance asserts the goals of public safety, traffic safety, health, welfare and aesthetics, a municipality has shown an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free speech); Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981) (holding that the goals of traffic safety and aesthetics advanced by a municipality as justification for regulating signs is a substantial governmental interest); St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. City of St. Louis, 249 U.S. 269 (1919) (finding that billboards may be prohibited in the residential districts of a city in the interest of the safety, morality, health and decency of the community); Members of the City Council of the City of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) (finding that a government entity can regulate signs and billboards when necessary to advance a significant and legitimate state interest, such as the protection of the aesthetics and quality of life within its jurisdiction); City of Doraville v. Turner Communications, Corp., 236 Ga. 385 (1976) (finding that under its police power authority, a municipality can regulate the location and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs within their territorial jurisdiction); Spratlin Outdoor Media, Inc. v. City of Douglasville, 2006 WL 826077 (N.D.Ga. 2006) (upholding sign ordinance where the ordinance's height and setback restrictions were rationally related to its stated goals of promoting the health, safety, morality and general welfare of the community, promoting the orderly and beneficial development of the city, promoting adequate access to natural light and air, improving the aesthetic appearance of the city, and encouraging the most appropriate use of land and buildings in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan).

Sec. 8-71. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Albany, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.

(1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on property values, urban blight, litter and sexual assault and exploitation. 
(2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from certain land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses and the surrounding area, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
(3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and nonsexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented business that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

Sec. 14-3. - References to officials in adopted technical codes. 
    Where reference is made to the duties of certain officials named within the technical codes which are adopted by reference in this chapter, then that designated official of the city, who has duties corresponding to those of the named official in said technical code, shall be deemed to be the responsible official insofar as enforcing the provisions of that technical code are concerned. 
Sec. 14-4. - Permitting process; building permits and administration of construction codes. 
(a)  All applications for building permits, grading plans, land disturbance permits will be made to the inspection department. Only two complete sets of plans will be submitted at this time. No other department will accept these type of plans. 
(b)  On Tuesday and Thursday of each week staff of the inspection, engineering, environmental health, planning and water, gas, and light departments will meet to review all plans submitted since the previous meeting. These plans will be reviewed to determine if all required information has been submitted, not that the plans meet all codes. If the plans are complete the applicant will be notified and the appropriate number of plans will be submitted to inspection. If the plans are incomplete the applicant will be notified in writing with every specific deficiency noted. When corrected the plans will be resubmitted and the process will begin again. 
(c)  After certification that plans are complete and the appropriate number of sets of plans are submitted to the inspection department only, the inspection department will route plans to the departments whose review is required. Those departments will have the number of days as listed in the developers handbook to complete their review. All approved plans will be submitted to the inspection department by the various departments and a permit will be issued. If there are deficiencies in the plans the reviewing department will notify the inspection department in writing as soon as possible, but not wait until the end of the review period. The inspection department will then notify the applicant in writing of the needed corrections. When all items have been corrected permits will be issued. 
(d)  All progress and final inspections will be coordinated through the inspection department. Applicants/contractors will call inspection and a log will be made of each type of inspection requested. At the end of each day inspection will fax a list of all scheduled inspections to the appropriate department. When all final inspections have been completed a certificate of occupancy will be issued. To make this work correctly several points are important. 
(1)  Plans will no longer be accepted for review at any department other than inspection. This will insure that the review is coordinated and maintained. Additionally, all fees will be paid at the inspection department. 
(2)  Should a department have a question regarding something in the plan, it will be possible for that department to contact the applicant/engineer to resolve the question. 
(3)  The inspection department will monitor all of the review process. On a weekly basis the city manager will be provided a report on the status of all project reviews. 
(e)  The fees for the reinspections, review of plans, subsequent reviews, additional plan review, and building permits shall be as established by the board of city commissioners, from time to time, and are available for public examination in the offices of planning and development, the city clerk, and are listed in the fee schedule.

No such levy shall be assessed upon or collected from any practitioner whose office is maintained by and who is employed in practice exclusively by the United States, the state, a municipality or county of the state, or any instrumentality thereof. 
(2)  Levy of occupation tax on attorneys. As of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, an occupation tax is hereby imposed on the professional classification known as attorneys engaged in the practice of law. 
a.  Attorneys not required to register. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this article, an attorney shall not be required to register with the treasurer division. Information reported with any occupation tax payment may be retained by the treasurer division and used for those purposes allowed by applicable law. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this article, an attorney shall not be required to obtain, display or maintain any city issued certificate showing that any payment or information has been submitted to the treasurer division. For the purposes of enforcement of the zoning ordinance, attorneys may be asked by the planning and development services department to submit notarized affidavits or other written information concerning the business or profession carried on at a location and the dates of operation when applying for a certificate of occupancy for new construction or renovation. Such affidavits or documents shall be used for the purposes of determining compliance with the zoning ordinance and shall not prevent the practice of the profession of law at any other location which has a valid certificate of occupancy. A refusal to submit a notarized affidavit or other written information stating whether a person engages in the practice of law at a particular location or stating the dates of operation at a location shall not be a violation of this article and shall not prevent an attorney from practicing law in the city. The chief financial officer shall document this refusal for use in any later proceeding. Where an attorney fails or refuses to provide information as to the location where they may be served with notices or citations issued in support of the enforcement of this article, the city shall direct the notices or citations to the address listed with the state bar and shall consider the failure or refusal of the attorney to provide current address information to be consent to this method of service. 
b.  Calculation of amount of tax. An attorney who practices law in the jurisdiction of the city shall at their option have their tax rate determined, but not the time of payment, in the manner set forth in subsection (2)(a) of this section. 
c.  Date when taxes are due; date when taxes become delinquent; amount of interest and penalties. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this article, an attorney shall not be required to pay the occupation tax on the income generated from the practice of law in any calendar year until April 1 of the year following. The tax may be paid in person at the treasurer division or by mailing the tax to the treasurer division. Any tax payment made by mail shall include the name and address of the person or law firm paying the tax and the name of each attorney whose tax is being paid, so that the treasurer division may process the payment. An attorney who pays the occupation tax on their own behalf shall include the name of the law firm with which they practice, if any. Any tax paid pursuant to the option of subsection (1) of this section shall include a written submission containing sufficient information to enable the chief financial officer to determine the accuracy of the taxpayer's calculation. Taxes due from attorneys shall not be considered delinquent until June 1. An attorney who does not pay the tax prior to June 1 shall incur a penalty of ten percent of the tax due. Any taxes not paid by the due date shall accrue interest at the rate of 11/2 percent per month. 
d.  Option of the chief financial officer to send bills. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this article, the chief financial officer may choose to send bills to attorneys who list their address with the State Bar of Georgia as being located in the city, including those attorneys who list only post office boxes as their addresses. An attorney who prepares and signs a notarized affidavit that they did not practice law within the jurisdiction of the city during some part of the tax year for which the tax bill was generated may have their bill adjusted for the time period stated in the affidavit when such attorney did not maintain an office within the jurisdiction of the city and/or states such other reasons why the occupation tax should be adjusted. Such adjustment shall not be made for those attorneys who elect to pay the $400.00 per practitioner fee as set forth in subsection (1) of this section unless the affidavit states that the attorney did not practice law in the jurisdiction of the city at any time during the year for which the tax bill was generated. The chief financial officer is authorized to inquire whether such affidavit matches the information maintained by the State Bar of Georgia in connection with the directives of state bar rule 1-207 and/or to take such other steps as deemed necessary to determine the accuracy of the affidavit. The submission of an affidavit requesting adjustment shall not act to prevent the imposition of penalties and interest should the chief financial officer deny the request for adjustment. The option of the chief financial officer to send bills shall not relieve attorneys from the obligation to pay any tax due for any calendar year including 2006 by April 1 of the following year. The chief financial officer may include in any bills, the unpaid tax balance from other years, including all fees and penalties and the amount of interest, which has accrued on any unpaid tax liability. The failure of the chief financial officer to list any unpaid balance on any bill shall not operate to relieve the taxpayer from liability for any balance due. It shall be a violation of this section for any attorney to willfully and intentionally misrepresent a material fact in an affidavit to avoid the payment of the occupation tax imposed by this division. The sole enforcement mechanisms for enforcement of the occupation tax levy against attorneys is limited to the following: 
1.  When the chief financial officer has reason to believe that an attorney has willfully and intentionally misrepresented a material fact in any affidavit submitted to treasurer division for the purposes of avoiding full payment of the occupation tax, the chief financial officer shall consult with the city attorney to determine whether such conduct should be referred to the State Bar of Georgia for investigation as to whether a violation of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct has occurred. 
2.  An attorney required to pay the occupation tax and who fails to do so in the manner provided by this article, shall be liable to have the tax and any penalties and interest collected by the issuance of execution pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-13-26. Further proceedings concerning the execution procedure employed in the enforcement of this section shall be as provided by state law. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in other sections of this article, the use of tax executions and the reporting of any alleged misrepresentations as set forth in subsection (2)(d)1. of this section shall be the sole mechanism for enforcement of the occupation tax levy against attorneys. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the provisions of section 16-70 shall not apply to attorneys. 
e.  Payment of city funds. Payment of city funds to attorneys or law firms employing attorneys not in compliance with the requirements of this division is not authorized; occupation tax payments to be considered in employment of attorneys by the city. 
1.  No individual attorney, or law firm employing such attorney, who is delinquent in the payment of the occupation tax authorized by this article, shall be paid for any legal work in which they have represented the city in any capacity, until any outstanding occupation tax liability, including all penalties and interest, has been paid in full. If the chief financial officer believes that an individual attorney, or any attorneys employed by a law firm, seeking compensation for legal services performed for the city, is/are not in full compliance with this division, the chief financial officer shall notify the individual attorney, or law firm and present a bill for the amount due. After payment of any outstanding occupation tax liability, the individual attorney, or law firm may be paid for the legal work in which they have represented the city. 
2.  The chief financial officer and/or the city attorney are authorized to verify that any individual attorney, or the attorneys employed by any law firm, seeking to represent the city, including without limitation, limitation, acting as bond counsel, is/are current in their occupation tax payments prior to their employment. Because of the legal and/or fiduciary relationships, which such representation of the city may create, the chief financial officer and/or the city attorney are authorized to consider compliance with the occupation tax ordinance by the individual attorneys and/or the attorneys employed by the law firm, prior to any employment by the city. 
f.  Appeals and refund claims. Appeals of decisions of the chief financial officer and/or refund claims under this division shall be as provided under state law.

Sec. 22-3. - Appellate review. 
    The orders, verdicts, judgments, and sentences of the court shall be subject to appellate review by writ of certiorari in the appropriate the county superior court or as otherwise provided by general state law. 
(1)  Any person who has been convicted of any criminal or quasi-criminal offense or violation of any ordinance, in any inferior judicatory by whatever name called, who desires a writ of certiorari to review and correct the judgment of conviction in the case shall be entitled to a supersedeas of the judgment, if such person or his or her attorney files with the clerk of the court the proper papers, and, a bond payable to the municipality, in amount and with security acceptable to, and to be approved by the clerk of court, or chief judge as a condition that the defendant will personally appear and abide the final judgment, order, or sentence upon such person in the case. 
(2)  All bonds must be paid to the city treasury department. The bond may be forfeited in the same manner as any other criminal or civil bond in any other court having jurisdiction. A bond may be forfeited according to the procedure prescribed in any of the municipal ordinances, or any provision of this chapter, or any state law granted to local municipalities. Alternatively, an action may be brought on the bond in any court having jurisdiction. Upon the giving of a bond the defendant shall be released from custody in the same manner as defendants are released upon supersedeas bonds in criminal cases where a notice of appeal has been filed. 
(3)  If the defendant is unable because of his or her indigence to make bond and makes this fact known by affidavit to be filed with the judge or clerk of court, as the case may be, the same shall operate as a supersedeas of the judgment; provided, however, that the defendant shall not be set at liberty unless the defendant gives a bond as prescribed in subsections (a) and/or (b) of this section. 
(4)  The supersedeas provided for in this section shall operate to suspend the judgment of conviction until the case is finally heard, and determined in the county superior court, to which it is taken by certiorari, or by the court of appeals upon appeal, provided that within the time prescribed by law the defendant shall apply for and procure the writ and remedies provided by law for reviewing the judgment complained of. The supersedeas shall be equally applicable whether the judge of the county superior court to whom the petition for certiorari is presented sanctions it or refuses it, provided that within the time provided by law the defendant diligently files a notice of appeal. 
(5)  The object of this section is to provide a method by which a defendant may obtain a supersedeas so long as the defendent is prosecuting or is entitled under the law to prosecute the proceeding brought or to be brought to review the conviction of which he or she is complaining, or any intermediate appellate judgment rendered thereon, in order that the defendant shall not be deprived of his or her right to apply to the courts by being compelled to serve his or her sentence or pay a fine before he or she has had the full opportunity allowed him or her by law of taking the necessary appeal under certiorari.

When such a matter occurs the officer of the court must voluntarily notify the court and recuse themselves immediately.

(2)  Duty of the presiding judge. When the presiding judge is presented with a motion to recuse, accompanied by an affidavit, the presiding judge shall temporarily cease to act upon the merits of the matter and shall immediately determine the timeliness of the motion and legal sufficiency of the affidavit, and make a determination, assuming any of the facts alleged in the affidavit to be true, whether recusal would be warranted. If it is found that the motion is timely, the affidavit sufficient and the recusal would be authorized if some or all of the facts set forth in the affidavit are true, the motion to recuse shall be heard by a Magistrate Court Judge of Dougherty County, as designated by the Chief Judge of Dougherty County State Court, or if not, a Superior Court Judge of Dougherty County Judicial Circuit. 
(3)  Procedure upon a motion for recusal. If the recusal motion is sustained, the presiding judge shall be recused and another judge shall be assigned to preside. In the absence of another municipal court judge, a state court judge (other than the judge who heard the motion) shall be appointed by the chief judge of state court to sit in the place of the recused judge on that case only. 
(4)  Voluntary recusal. If the presiding judge either on his or her own motion or that of one of the parties, voluntarily recuses himself, another judge shall be assigned to hear the matter involved. If another municipal court judge is not available to preside, or for any reason cannot preside, a state court judge (other than the judge who heard the motion) shall be appointed by the chief judge of state court to sit in the place of the recused judge. 
(5)  Selection of judge. Any municipal court judge involved in a recusal motion shall not communicate on the subject or on the matter to any of his or her associate judges of the municipal court of Albany, State Court Judges of Dougherty County or, Superior Court Judges of Dougherty County Judicial Circuit until such matter has been properly disposed of.

(1)  Two or more photographs; 
(2)  Two or more microphotographs; 
(3)  Two or more digital images;

    Signature means any manual or facsimile of a person's signature. 
    System location means the approach to an intersection toward which a photographic, video, digital or electronic camera is directed and in operation. 
    Traffic light signal violation monitoring system means a device adapted for use at a signalized intersection or crosswalk, working in conjunction with a traffic control signal or independently to produce recorded images of motor vehicles entering an intersection against a red signal indication. 
(b)  Offense. The following provisions shall be the traffic regulation for automated red light enforcement: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line or, if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if there is no crosswalk, before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown by a steady circular green signal. 
(2)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication shall stop at a clearly marked stop line or, if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if there is no crosswalk, before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown by a steady green arrow signal indication. 
(3)  The owner of a vehicle shall be liable for a monetary penalty imposed pursuant to this section if such vehicle is found, as evidenced by information obtained from a traffic light signal violation monitoring system, to have failed to comply with a traffic light signal as designated in subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section or violate any other traffic regulation specified in O.C.G.A. §§ 40-6-20 and 40-6-21. 
(c)  Proof certificate. The following provisions shall be proof certification for automated red light violations: 
(1)  Proof that a particular vehicle entered an intersection in violation of subsection (b) of this section, as detected by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system, together with proof that the particular vehicle is registered with the state department of public safety (or any other state vehicle registration office) in the charged person's name, shall raise the evidentiary presumption and constitute prima facie evidence in any prosecution of a violation of that section that the charged person was the person driving the vehicle depicted in the recorded image. 
(2)  A certificate, sworn to or affirmed by a trained law enforcement officer or a technician employed by a law enforcement agency for which such device is authorized, based on inspection of recorded images produced by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein. 
(3)  Any recorded images detected by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system shall be available for inspection in any proceeding to adjudicate the liability for such violation pursuant to this section. 
(4)  Such presumption shall be rebutted if the owner, lessee, or renter of the vehicle files a notarized affidavit by regular mail with the clerk of the municipal court that such owner, lessee, or renter was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation or testifies in open court under oath that such owner, lessee, or renter was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation.

(6)  Such presumption shall be rebutted if the charged person can provide evidence that he or she was not the registered owner of the vehicle at the time and date that the alleged violation occurred. A bill of sale that includes, the name of the purchaser and the seller, the date of the sale, and the vehicles license tag dated prior to the alleged violation will constitute evidence that the charged person was not the registered owner of the vehicle at the time that the alleged violation occurred. 
(7)  Such presumption shall be rebutted if the recorded image depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of subsection (b) of this section as part of a funeral procession. 
(8)  Such presumption shall be rebutted if the recorded image depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of subsection (b) of this section in order to avoid impeding the efforts of an emergency vehicle to pass through the intersection. 
(9)  Not withstanding any other provision of this section, if the recorded image detected by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of subsection (b) of this section is commercially licensed, then the owner of that vehicle shall be sent notice of the date, time and location of the alleged violation with at least two recorded images thereof. Within ten days of the receipt of said notice, the owner of the vehicle shall provide proof to the city of the name and address of the driver of the vehicle at the date, time and location of the violation and within the same time period, shall provide the driver of the vehicle with at least two recorded images of the alleged violation. After receipt by the city of the proof of the name and address of the driver of the vehicle, the driver of the vehicle shall be prima facie responsible for such violation. Failure of the owner of the vehicle found to be in violation of subsection (b) of this section to provide the name and address of the driver at the time of the violation within the period prescribed shall cause the owner to be held responsible as set forth in subsection (b) of this section. 
(d)  Penalty; effect of a conviction. The following provisions shall be the penalty for automated red light violations: 
(1)  Imposition of a penalty pursuant to this section shall be deemed a noncriminal violation and not as an operator and shall not be made a part of the operating record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed nor shall it be used for insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage. The monetary penalty imposed by this section for each violation shall be equal to the fine issued by the city municipal court for disregarding a traffic device at the time of the alleged violation and shall not include court costs. The monetary penalty imposed by this section for each violation shall double the amount of the fine issued by the city municipal court for disregarding a traffic device if the alleged violation occurs in a designated "School Zone," as defined by the state law. 
(2)  Failure to pay the civil penalty or file an appeal within 30 days after notification of the violation shall result in an additional penalty. Every 30-day period thereafter shall result in another additional penalty. The amount of the additional penalties shall be established by ordinance or resolution of the board of city commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the city clerk. 
(3)  The city may establish procedures for the collection of the civil penalties and may enforce the penalties by a civil action in the nature of a debt. 
(e)  Summons. The following shall be the summons regulations for an automated red light violation: 
(1)  A summons for a violation of this section may be executed by the city by mailing by first class mail a copy thereof to the address of the owner, lessee, or renter of the vehicle as shown, in the case of vehicle owners, in the records of the state department of public safety (or any other state vehicle registration office) or, in the case of vehicle lessees or renters, in the records of the lessor or renter. 
(2)  No proceedings for contempt or arrest shall be instituted for failure to appear on the return date of the summons. 
(f)  Private entities. A private entity may enter into an agreement with the city to be compensated for providing the traffic light signal violation monitoring system or equipment, and all related support services, to include consulting, operations and administration. However, only a trained law enforcement officer or a technician employed by a law enforcement agency for which such device is authorized, may swear to or affirm the certificate required by subsection (c) of this section.

Sec. 36-103. - Board up permits 
(a)  No person, firm, association or corporation shall erect, install, place, or maintain boards over the doors, windows, or other openings of any building or structure or otherwise secure such openings by a means other than the conventional method used in the original construction and design of the building or structure without first applying for and, within 30 days of application, completing all steps necessary for the issuance of a boarding permit and thereafter having a valid and current boarding permit therefor from the building official. Any properties with boards existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived will have one year from the date of the ordinance's adoption to make application to continue to board. 
(b)  The director of planning and development services shall issue a boarding permit required by subsection (a) of this section upon the submission of a written application by the owner of the property or such owner's authorized representative or contractor, upon the payment of the required fee and upon the confirmation through inspection by the director of code enforcement or the director of code enforcement's designee that the boarding or other method of securing the building or structure has been done in compliance with this article. The director of planning and development services is authorized to establish a fee schedule so as to enable the city to offset its reasonable expenses in reviewing the application and monitoring the boarding process. 
(c)  The boarding permit issued pursuant to this section shall authorize the boarding or other securing of a building or structure for an initial period of six months. If the structure is still boarded at the end of each such six months, the boarding permit may be renewed upon the submission of a written application by the owner of the property or their authorized representative or contractor with the submission of the application occurring no later than ten business days prior to the expiration of the original permit, upon the payment of the required fee and upon the confirmation through inspection by a city code enforcement officer that the boarding or other method of securing the building or structure has been done in compliance with this article. The issuance of a renewal-boarding permit shall also be subject to all of the following conditions: 
(1)  The owner shall submit a detailed plan for correction, repair or rehabilitation of violations of state or local building and housing standards and for the securing of the doors, windows and other openings by the conventional method used in the original construction and design of the building or structure or, alternatively, a detailed plan for sale of the property to another person or entity with provision in the sale of correction, repair or rehabilitation; 
(2)  The owner shall submit a time line for applying for appropriate permits for such work and for completing such work prior to the expiration of the renewal permit, or alternatively, a timeline for the sale of the property; 
(3)  The permit may be revoked by written notice of the director of planning and development services, at the recommendation of the director of code enforcement, if the owner fails to comply with the plan for such work or fails to comport to the timeline submitted. 
(d)  A boarding permit may not be extended beyond the renewal period nor may a new application for the same property be accepted by the director of planning and development services within one year of the date of expiration of the prior permit, except upon the submission of a written application by the owner of the property or their authorized representative or contractor, upon the payment of the required fee, upon the confirmation through inspection by a city code enforcement officer that the boarding or other method of securing the building or structure has been done in compliance with this chapter and upon demonstration that "good cause" for the renewal exists. "Good cause" shall require a showing by the owner that the permit renewal is made necessary by conditions or events beyond the owner's control, such as inability to obtain financing for repair or rehabilitation, inability to locate a suitable buyer, unanticipated delays in construction or rehabilitation, or unanticipated damage to the property. In addition, where appropriate, "good cause" shall also require a showing by the owner that the owner has exercised reasonable and due diligence in attempting to complete the needed repair, rehabilitation or correction or is attempting to sell the property. In the event that the director of planning and development services determines that there exists good cause to renew the permit and that all other conditions are met, the permit may be renewed by the owner for an additional one year, subject to all of the same conditions imposed on the original renewal permit.

(1)  Securing by boarding. Windows and similar openings shall be boarded with exterior grade plywood of a minimum thickness of five-eighths inch nominal or its equivalent. Vent holes may be required, as deemed necessary by the city. The plywood shall be secured in place by two inches by four inches or four inches by four inches cross members, secured to the plywood by three-eighths inch plated carriage bolts with large washers at each end and with the cross member turned so that the carriage bolt goes through the larger dimension. Bolts used to secure the cross member shall be threaded to the correct length. A minimum of two cross members shall be used on each window and, depending on the size of the opening, additional cross members may be required. Each cross member shall be a continuous piece of lumber, and each must extend at least one foot past the window opening in each direction. Bolts and nuts used to secure the cross members to the plywood must be tightened enough to slightly deflect the wood. Bolt heads must fit tightly against the wood and not give a surface for pliers or pry bars. 
(2)  Exterior doors. Exterior doors shall be boarded with exterior grade plywood of a minimum thickness of five-eighths inch nominal or its equivalent, fitted to the entry doorjamb with maximum one-eighth inch clearance for each edge. The existing door should be removed and stored inside the building. The plywood shall be attached to three horizontal two-inch by four-inch wooden crossbars each with two three-eighths inch carriage bolts and matching hardware.

(3)  Painting of boarded openings. All boarded openings shall be painted with a minimum of one coat of exterior paint, which is of a color compatible with the exterior color of the building or structure. 
(4)  Alternative methods of securing a building. Upon application for a boarding permit, the building official may approve alternative methods of securing a vacant and unoccupied building or structure. In making the determination to approve any alternative method, the city shall consider the aesthetic and other impacts of such method on the immediate neighborhood and the extent to which such method provides adequate and longterm security against the unauthorized entry to the property. 
(b)  Additional requirements. In connection with the boarding of the doors, windows or other openings of any building or structure or any means of securing such openings, other than by the conventional method used in the original construction and design of the building or structure, the owner shall also comply with all of the following requirements: 
(1)  All utility service to the building or structure shall be terminated by removal of the meters and termination of electric power at the pole. Compliance with this subsection may be waived in writing by the city as to the electric utility service in the event that electricity is needed to power exterior security lighting, an alarm system or equipment to be used in connection with rehabilitation of the building or structure for which there is an active and current building permit; 
(2)  The sewer shall be capped in a manner approved by the city so as to prevent the accumulation of methane gas in the building or structure; 
(3)  The interior of the building or structure shall be cleaned of all trash, junk, garbage, debris, and solid waste, and personal possessions shall be removed from the interior of the building or structure, so as to eliminate any fire or health hazard and prevent hindrance to firefighting equipment or personnel in the event of a fire.

Sec. 36-178. - Legislative findings and purpose. 
(a)  The City of Albany, Georgia, having received an increasing number of complaints from the citizens of the city concerning radio and other noises emanating from vehicles on the public streets and ways and properties of the city, and having made certain observations on the subject, hereby finds and declares that: 
(1)  Excessive noise, when unnecessary to the carrying on of religious, political, civic, or commercial activities, or when not generated in the course of other activity necessary to carrying on the daily life, creates a significant threat to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(2)  Those noises which are most obnoxious to public health, safety and welfare in the city are those which are loud, boisterous, raucous, unseemly, or which are generated solely for the purpose of entertainment of a person or group of persons without regard to the health, welfare and safety of others who are unable to avoid being subjected to such noises. 
(3)  There has been an alarming increase in the frequency and volume of noise from the many portable sound reproducing devices available today, such as portable radios, tape recorders, and cassette players. 
(b)  It is, therefore, the intent of this division to strike an appropriate balance between the right of individuals to obtain information and derive pleasure by listening to radios and other devices, and the right of the public to a peaceful and healthful environment. It is not the intent of this legislation to interfere unduly with freedom of speech or religion by regulating the initial production or amplification of sound.

(a)  Insofar as practicable, sound will be measured while the source under investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions and, as necessary, at other conditions, including but not limited to, design, maximum and fluctuating rates. All noise measurements shall be made at or within the property line of the impacted site, unless otherwise directed in this division. When instrumentation cannot be placed at or within the property line, the measurement shall be made as close thereto as is reasonable. For the purposes of this division, noise measurements are measurements are measured on the A- or C-weighted sound scale, as applicable, of a sound level meter of standard design and quality having characteristics established by ANSI. 
(b)  Measurements shall be taken by police or code enforcement officers, or code enforcement inspectors, appropriately trained in the use of a sound level meter. 
(c)  The ambient noise levels shall be subtracted from the measured sound levels of the source under investigation by using Table 2 to determine the sound levels from the source of interest alone. If the ambient sound level is less than four dB higher than the background sound level, the source level cannot be derived and a violation of the article cannot be substantiated.

These sound level measurements shall be conducted with the sound level meter set for "C" weighting, "fast" response. Such measurements shall not be taken in areas that receive only casual use, such as hallways, closets and bathrooms. For the purposes of these measurements, the ambient sound level is that sound level which is measured in the building when the sound source under investigation is not prominent, or in a room on the same floor that is relatively unaffected by the sound source under investigation. This "C" scale measurement shall be in addition to the property line measurement described in subparagraph (a) of this section.

Any individual who claims to be adversely affected by allowance of the special variance may file a statement with the city manager or the city manager's representative containing any information to support such individual's claim. 
(c)  In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the city manager or the city manager's designated representative shall balance the hardship to the applicant, the community, and other persons of not granting the special variance against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected, and any other adverse impact of granting the special variance. Applicants for special variances may be required to submit any information the city manager or the city manager's representative may reasonably require. In granting or denying an application, the city manager or the city manager's representative shall place on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying or granting the special variance. 
(d)  Special variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted activity.

(d)  Graffiti penalty. Any person who is convicted of violating subsection (c) above shall be punished by a fine of not exceeding $500.00 or by imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both. In addition to such punishment, the court may, in imposing sentence, order the defendant to restore the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed. 
(e)  Notice of removal. The property owner, manager or agent, whether the property is privately or publicly owned, is obligated to remove any graffiti from the property within a five-day of notice. Whenever the city becomes aware of the existence of graffiti on any property, including structures or improvements, a police officer or code enforcement officer shall give or cause to be given, a five-day notice to the property owner and/or owner's agent or manager to remove such graffiti.

ARTICLE V. - SPECIAL EVENTS 

Sec. 40-109. - Definitions. 
    Words and terms used in this article are defined as follows: 
    Permit: A permit as required by this article. 
    Private Function: A gathering of individuals that is not advertised; is by invitation-only; and is without charge for admission to which the general public is neither invited nor allowed to attend. The guests and attendants are served in an area designated and used exclusively for the private function or event. The private function is normally booked, or set, in advance by a single contact person with the number of guests appropriate for the area. It is normally composed of a cohesive group whose members are individually invited by the host of the private function. If alcohol is involved, only those invited members may consume alcohol and they are not charged for the cost of the alcohol. The exception is when a cohesive group pools money to fund the private function, as opposed to a cover charge or entrance fee. A cover charge or entrance fee precludes a function from meeting the definition of a private party. Examples of qualifying groups as "private functions" include, but are not limited to, wedding receptions, family parties, corporate and company functions. It does not include an open invitation by a licensed establishment or business to the general public for a gathering at which the individual invitees are expected to pay for their food and beverages or for their admission to the function. 
    Promoter or sponsor: An individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, organization or other entity that plans for, hosts, produces, conducts and/or carries out special events. 
    Special event: Any private, for-profit or non-profit activity, ceremony, exhibition, show, concert, pageant, march, rally, block party, carnival, circus, fair, demonstration parade or assembly other than the normal day to day or seasonal operations open to the general public free of charge or for an entry fee and taking place or otherwise impacting or potentially impacting government services (e.g. police responses to noise complaints)either fully or in part on public streets, rights of way, thoroughfares, parks, squares, public property (with approval of city or county, respectively), semi-public parking facilities as defined in 6-13(a) or outdoors on private property.

(Ord. No. 17-117, § II, 11-14-2017) 
Sec. 50-3. - Exemptions. 
    This chapter shall apply to any land disturbing activity undertaken by any person on any land except for the following: 
(1)  Surface mining, as the same is defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-4-72, "The Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968". 
(2)  Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying; 
(3)  Such minor land disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion; 
(4)  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and this paragraph. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b) and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the local issuing authority;

(Ord. No. 17-117, § III, 11-14-2017) 
Sec. 50-4. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 50-4(b) and (c) of this chapter. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in section 50-4(b) and (c) of this chapter shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15)-(17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 50-4(b)(2) of this chapter; 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to [O.C.G.A] § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to [O.C.G.A.] § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015, if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
(18)  All waste from construction activities at the construction site shall be controlled and properly disposed of in a manner which prevents adverse impacts to water quality. Waste includes, but is not limited to: discarded building materials, chemicals, litter, sanitary waste, and concrete truck washout. A designated area for concrete washdown of tools, concrete mixer chutes, hoppers and the rear of vehicles shall be provided in a location convenient to construction activities and readily accessible by concrete trucks. The designated area shall be a zero discharge containment facility which completely prevents concrete wash water from infiltrating into the ground or discharging to any natural or structural stormwater drainage conveyance or to any waters of the state. Washout of the drum of a concrete truck at a construction site, unless in a designated washdown facility, is prohibited. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 50-4(b) and (c) of this chapter. 
(e)  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 17-117, § IV, 11-14-2017) 
Sec. 50-5. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Albany, Georgia without first obtaining a permit from the City of Albany Engineering Director to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Albany Engineering Department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 50-5(c) of this chapter. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 50-4(b) and (c) of this chapter will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 50-4(c)(15)-(17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 50-5(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this chapter section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 50-4(b) of this chapter, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this chapter, any variances required by section 50-4(c)(15)-(17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 50-5(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this chapter, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7 (f) (1). 
(Ord. No. 17-117, § V, 11-14-2017) 
Sec. 50-6. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The City of Albany Engineering Department will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
(b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
(c)  The City of Albany Engineering Department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities. 
(d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
(f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to [O.C.G.A] § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority.

Chapter 54 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
ARTICLE I. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

Sec. 54-1. - Findings of fact. 
    In support of establishment of a stormwater utility, the mayor and board of commissioners makes the following findings of fact: 
(a)  The City of Albany is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I and III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the City of Albany (hereinafter "the city" or "Albany"). 
(b)  In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, Albany is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its city charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal, a system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas. 
(c)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff may: 
(1)  Cause erosion of lands; threaten businesses, residences, and other facilities with water damage; and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams, and other bodies of water within, and downstream of, the city. 
(2)  Adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the City of Albany thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. 
(3)  Contribute to the potential degradation of the quality of both surface water and groundwater resources. 
(d)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for implementation of its comprehensive stormwater management program and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
(e)  The city is required under federal and state regulations [i.e. the Federal Clean Water Act, the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (hereinafter "NPDES") Phase II Stormwater Permit] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to establish a stormwater utility and impose a stormwater user fee charge upon improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4, or receive stormwater services from the city, either directly or indirectly, whether or not the property is private or public in nature. 
(f)  Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the city's NPDES phase II stormwater permit, the city's wastewater treatment permits, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and the other applicable regulatory programs will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for stormwater management program implementation, water quality management, drainage system maintenance, floodplain management, capital construction and other program activities. 
(g)  The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management system and the funding of necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the city's stormwater management program. 
(h)  The due diligence work, financial analysis and related documents prepared by the city's stormwater consultant properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and operational costs as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy. 
(i)  Given the stormwater management program's needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city in concert with other water resource management programs. 
(j)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the City of Albany is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(k)  The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management to improved properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management program which results in services being provided to such properties. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the user fee charge correlates to the stormwater management services provided to that property and the runoff demand that the property imposes on the public drainage system and the city's stormwater management program. 
(l)  The stormwater management needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, businesses, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways even though the benefits may be indirect or immeasurable. 
(m)  A stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to implement an enhanced level of service for stormwater management service delivery within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms. 
(n)  The amount of impervious surface on each improved property is the most important factor influencing stormwater runoff characteristics and these characteristics bear a rational nexus to the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city, or to be provided by the city in the future, to that property. As a result, the amount of impervious surface on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge. 
(o)  A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Stormwater utility user fee charges may be designed with specific modifiers to further enhance customer equity, as well as customer understanding of the user fee charge rate structure, while at the same time minimizing the city's customer account management and maintenance efforts. 
(p)  Stormwater utility user fee charges may be supplemented by other types of fees and charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city commission. 
(q)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site stormwater control facilities, activities or assets which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the impact of a particular property on the city's stormwater management program, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or a credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility. Credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the reduction and mitigation of the stormwater runoff impacts from the property. 
(r)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, systems or facilities, together with any other supplemental revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and supplemental revenues shall therefore be deposited into the City of Albany Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes in accordance with applicable sections of the aforementioned master trust indenture. 
(s)  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of the City of Albany hereby exercises its authority to establish stormwater utility user fee charge rates for the provision of stormwater management services.

Improved property may be classified as SFR even if supplemental accessory structures are present such as garages, carports, storage buildings, guesthouses, servants or caretaker's quarters, cottages or barns, or the presence of a commercial use within the residence, as long as such use does not result in significant additional amounts of impervious surfaces. SFR properties shall not include improved property containing structures used primarily for non-residential purposes; manufactured homes located within manufactured home parks where the land is owned by someone other than the owners of the manufactured homes; residential condominium developments with more than two units; or vacant/undeveloped property. 
    Stormwater management services mean all water quality and water quantity related services provided by the city which relate to the: 
(1)  Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the incorporated areas of the city; 
(2)  Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities; 
(3)  Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs;

Sec. 54-6. - Stormwater user fee charges. 
(a)  It shall be the policy of the city that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service area shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services by the city. 
(b)  The basis for calculation of the stormwater user fee charge to developed property within the city is established in this article. The city shall assign or determine the customer class, amount of impervious area and other pertinent factors as may be needed for the fair, reasonable and equitable allocation of the costs to deliver stormwater management services and to calculate the stormwater user fee charges for developed properties in the city. 
(c)  Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a reasonable connection, or rational nexus, to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city as defined herein. 
(d)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners which mitigate, or compensate for, the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities, or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities. 
(e)  The stormwater user fee charges shall accrue beginning April 1, 2014. 
(Ord. No. 13-133, § 1, 11-26-2013) 
Sec. 54-7. - Stormwater utility customer classes. 
(a)  The stormwater utility shall establish specified customer classes within the service area to reflect differences in impervious surface and stormwater runoff characteristics; stormwater management program services provided by the city to the customers; and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the city stormwater management program and drainage system components. Publically owned, developed properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties, unless otherwise exempted. The stormwater utility classes will encompass developed and undeveloped properties within the city and are defined as follows: 
(1)  Single family residential (SFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as SFR customers per the applicable definition. 
(2)  The non-single family residential (NSFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as NSFR customers per the applicable definition. 
(3)  The undeveloped class shall consist of properties classified as undeveloped per the applicable definition. 
(b)  Documentation pertaining to the stormwater utility customer classes shall be kept on file in the office of the stormwater utility manager for public inspection. 
(Ord. No. 13-133, § 1, 11-26-2013) 
Sec. 54-8. - Stormwater utility user fee charge rates. 
(a)  The stormwater utility shall impose a stormwater user fee on developed properties within the service area in a fair and equitable manner. The stormwater utility shall apportion the cost of delivering stormwater services to developed properties based on the demand the property places on the city's stormwater management program, the stormwater services provided by the city to that property and the benefits derived. 
(b)  The stormwater user fee rate is initially set at $2.50 per ERU. Stormwater user fees shall annually increase by the Consumer Price Index over the prior 12 month period. As used herein, the term "Consumer Price Index" is the Consumer Price Index published by the United States Department of Labor - Bureau of Labor Statistics All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), 1982-1984 +100. If the Consumer Price Index ceases to incorporate a significant number of items now incorporated therein, or if a substantial change is made in the method of establishing the Consumer Price Index, then the Consumer Price Index will be replaced with a reasonable substitute. Additionally, the billing rates may be modified by the mayor and city commission from time to time to meet the financial and operational needs of the Albany Stormwater Utility. A current schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk for public inspection. 
(c)  In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the goal of the mayor and city commission to establish rates that are fair, equitable and reasonable, and which, together with other funding sources available to the City of Albany Stormwater Utility for services, systems, and/or facilities related to stormwater management are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management program, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other stormwater utility related costs as deemed appropriate by the city. 
(d)  Stormwater user fee charges shall be based upon the total number of equivalent residential units (ERUs) associated with developed properties within the city. Each ERU shall correspond to 2,700 square feet of impervious surface. 
(e)  Gravel and compacted soil associated with driveways, parking areas, roads and other areas that consist of these type surface (or near surface) conditions on developed property will be designated as impervious surface and included in the customer's ERU calculation because of the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. The total surface area associated with these materials will be calculated at 85 percent of the total ERUs to reflect the hydrologic response characteristics and limited infiltration capabilities of partial impervious surface materials. 
(f)  Calculation of stormwater user fee charges. The periodic stormwater user fee charges imposed on developed properties shall be calculated by multiplying the stormwater user fee billing rate times the number of ERUs for each customer account. The number of ERUs that will be utilized to calculate the user fee charge for each customer account shall be in general accordance with the following: 
(1)  SFR customer class: Each SFR customer account shall be charged a flat rate of 1.0 ERU except as noted below. 
a.  If a SFR customer account consists of more than 8,100 square feet of impervious surface (or 3.0 ERUs), the customer account for that parcel will be charged as per the NSFR calculation described herein. 
(2)  NSFR customer class: Each NSFR customer shall be charged 1.0 ERU for each 2,700 square feet, or increment thereof, of impervious surface located on the property to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. Fractional ERUs will be rounded to one decimal place to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. 
(3)  Undeveloped land customer class: Undeveloped land shall not be charged a stormwater user fee.

(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable; 
(6)  Establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
(7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and longterm follow up. 
(b)  Applicability. All persons proposing development and/or construction within the city shall submit a stormwater management plan and hydrology study to the director of engineering (the director) for review of conformity with this chapter, except as provided in section 54-53. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria:

The city's inspection schedule shall be established on a frequency that meets the intent of this chapter and applicable regulatory compliance requirements bestowed on the city. 
(4)  The agreement shall provide that if, after an inspection, the condition of a facility presents an immediate danger to the public health, safety or general welfare because of unsafe conditions or improper maintenance, the city shall have the right, but not the duty, to take such action as may be necessary to protect the public health, safety, general welfare and adjacent properties from damage. If it is determined that such deficient conditions are the result of neglected maintenance, or other action caused by the property owner, then any cost incurred by the city shall be paid by the property owner as set forth in section 54-27. 
(5)  The agreement shall provide that the city shall notify the property owner of the facility of any violation, deficiency or failure to comply with this chapter. The agreement shall also provide that upon a failure to correct violations requiring maintenance work, within 30 days after notice thereof, the city may provide for all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. The city is entitled to recover its costs pursuant to section 54-27(d)(2). 
(c)  In lieu of an inspection and maintenance agreement, the mayor and board of commissioners may, at its discretion, accept dedication of any existing or future regional stormwater management facility for perpetual maintenance by the city, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this chapter, the LDM and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular structural maintenance by the city.

Periodic inspection of the development site shall be made by the director, or designee, to ensure that the stormwater management plan is properly implemented. 
(b)  Upon completion of the construction phase on the project, and prior to approval of the final plat or issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the developer shall provide an as-built survey and an as-built design certification for each stormwater management facility. One hard copy and one electronic copy of the survey shall be provided. The survey shall employ the state plane coordinate system for the state so that it may be incorporated into the city's GIS database. To ensure uniformity and consistency, the developer shall reference a known elevation marker or benchmark within the city. If the developer is unable to locate an appropriate marker within a one-mile radius of the site, the city will assist in identifying or establishing a suitable marker. 
(c)  A certified record drawing of the facility shall be prepared based upon this as-built survey and certified by the design professional who prepared the stormwater management plan. Based on the actual parameters established on the record drawing, an addendum to the stormwater management plan shall be prepared which demonstrates that the facility, as constructed, complies with the requirements of the approved stormwater management plan. 
(d)  Following final plat approval or issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the director of engineering, or the director of engineering's designee, shall conduct periodic inspections of the stormwater facility on a schedule established by the city. Inspection reports including documented deficiencies and needed maintenance requirements will be included on the inspection reports and provided to the property owner to undertake appropriate action.

DIVISION 4. - ADDRESS NUMBERING 

Sec. 56-102. - Administration and issuance by planning and development services department. 
(a)  The planning and development services department shall be the agency with exclusive overall administration and coordination responsibility to administer these guidelines following initial implementation. 
(b)  Street addresses shall be issued by the planning and development services department for all parcels and principle dwellings and buildings located on all officially mapped public and private roads. 
(c)  Addresses will be provided only on those roads that have been assigned a name in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this article. 
(Ord. No. 09-110, § 1(4.01), 2-24-2009) 
Sec. 56-103. - Address numbering system. 
(a)  Generally. 
(1)  The addressing system is based on a baseline/meridian structure. The county is divided into four quadrants based on the intersection of Broad Avenue and the Flint River. (See appendix A to this article) 
(2)  Block ranges are well established for the city and the county and form a relatively evenly spaced grid. Where possible, one address number shall be established for each 20-foot (+/-) interval. Addresses are assigned based on the driveway entrance, not the front of the structure. 
(3)  Even numbers shall be on the southerly sides of roads and odd numbers shall be on the northerly sides of roads. 
(4)  Even numbers shall be on the easterly sides of roads and odd numbers shall be on the westerly sides of roads. 
(5)  Roads which are not traveling due north-south/east-west or that meander shall be numbered as a north-south/east-west road if the major portion of the road within the county runs north-south/east-west. Once a north-south/east-west road has an address number assigned to structures, then that road shall always be considered to be a north-south/east-west road. 
(6)  Address numbers south of the baseline shall be affixed with the prefix "south," and address numbers north of the baseline shall be affixed with the prefix "north" to avoid duplication of address numbers. The above also applies to east and west streets. 
(b)  Fractional, alphanumeric, and hyphenated addresses. There shall be no use of fractional addresses, alphanumeric address numbers or hyphenated address numbers. This also applies to apartment numbers and suite numbers. 
(c)  Component order. Components of a street address shall always be in the following order: address number, directional prefix (if any), street name and street type, designation of apartment or suite, and apartment/suite number. 
(d)  Diagonal streets. Diagonal streets shall be treated as either north-south or east-west streets. Once orientation is established, it shall be used throughout the entire length of the road. The orientation will not change even if the road changes direction. Within developments, it is advisable to consider the direction of the beginning of the road. If it originates off a north-south road and begins by going east-west before meandering north-south, it is generally considered an east-west road. 
(e)  Circular streets. A circular street/road is one that returns to the same origin point or to the same originating road. Circular streets shall be numbered beginning at the low numbered intersection and continuing to the other end of the road. The outside of the circle is numbered first and the inside is then numbered mix and matched with the outside. This will result, in most cases, with fewer numbers on the inside of the circle and with larger spaces between inside numbers. The numbering sequences of the outside and inside of the circle shall be used throughout the entire length of the road. 
(f)  Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall be addressed using the system based on the baseline/meridian structure, with odd/even numbers on the appropriate sides of the street and meeting at the midpoint or the back of the cul-de-sac. 
(g)  Corner lots. It is preferable for corner lots to be addressed to the road that the driveway is accessed from. However, corner lots have the option of being addressed to the driveway or the front of the structure. Addresses based on the driveway shall require the mailbox to be placed at the driveway access. Addresses based on the front of the structure shall require the mailbox to be placed on the road at the front of that structure. Display of address numbers on the structure shall face the road to which the home is addressed. The assigned address will be determined by the site plan presented at the time a building permit is requested. 
(h)  Private drives/easements. Private drives/easements may be addressed to an existing adjoining road when they serve no more than two lots or structures. A sign or post which clearly indicates the address numbers assigned to the structures shall be located at the entry point of the private drive/easement. Private drives and easements that serve more than two lots or structures will be addressed to the private drive/easement. 
(i)  Single-family residences. A single-family residence shall receive its own individual address determined by the basic rules for distance and direction. 
(j)  Duplex residences. A duplex shall be addressed with each unit receiving its own individual address determined by the basic rules for distance and direction. 
(k)  Apartment residences. Apartments shall be numbered with the main building receiving one address and each individual apartment being assigned apartment numbers as secondary location indicators. The apartment number assigned should indicate floor location (e.g., apartment 204 being the fourth apartment on the second floor). Alphanumerical numbers are not to be used. Apartment buildings with multiple entrances, where each entrance provides access to a limited number of apartments, shall require an address for each individual entrance as determined by the street allowing main access to the entrance and following the basic rules for distance and direction. 

(l)  Mobile home parks/manufactured home communities. Each individual mobile home or manufactured home shall be assigned its own individual address following the basic rules for distance and direction. This generally results in leaving four to eight numbers between adjacent sites. 
(m)  Townhouses. Townhouses that are individually owned and not part of an apartment complex shall be assigned an individual address for each unit as determined by the street allowing main access to the building and following basic rules for distance and direction. In cases where entry is not from the street on which the townhouse is addressed (e.g., alleys or parking areas), address numbers shall be posted on both the front and rear of the structure. Townhouses that are under the apartment category will be addressed as apartments, with the main building receiving one address and each individual townhouse being assigned apartment numbers as secondary locators. 
(n)  Condominiums. 
(1)  Condominiums shall be assigned an individual address for each unit as determined by the street allowing main access to the building and following the basic rules for distance and direction. In cases where entry is not from the street on which the townhouse is addressed (e.g., alleys or parking areas), address numbers shall be posted on both the front and rear of the structure. 
(2)  An apartment building or townhouse complex that is converted to a condominium shall be required to be addressed with an individual address for each unit. 
(o)  Office buildings. Office buildings shall be numbered with the main building receiving one address and each individual office being assigned suite numbers as secondary; location indicators. The suite number assigned should indicate the floor location (e.g., suite 204 being the fourth office on the second floor). Alphanumerical numbers are not to be used. Office buildings with multiple entrances, where each entrance provides access to a limited number of offices, shall be assigned an address for each individual entrance as determined by the street allowing main access to the entrance and following the basic rules for distance and direction. 
(p)  Individual commercial buildings. 
(1)  Individual commercial buildings shall be given one address to the road/street on which the driveway access is located as determined by the basic rules for distance and direction. When a business faces a main road but is accessed from a secondary road, an address will be allowed to the main road if the primary entrance faces the main road. In addition to being posted on the side of the building facing the main road, this address shall be posted on the outside of the main building in a manner that is legible to the public as well as emergency responders from the point of access. 
(2)  An individual building housing more than one business shall require a separate address for each unit. Suite numbers shall not be allowed. 
(3)  A large retail complex/superstore that houses one main retail business with additional smaller retail spaces within (e.g., grocery store with cleaner, bank, hair salon, etc.) shall be assigned one address for the use of all businesses located within the main structure. This address shall be posted on the outside of the main building in a manner that is legible to the public as well as emergency responders. 
(q)  Strip commercial buildings. Strip commercial buildings shall require an address to be reserved for each individual entry door. Careful planning shall be taken to reserve enough numbers for future divisions of businesses. Each business shall receive its own individual address. If a business is large enough to use space accessed by two or more doors, the business shall be assigned the number that corresponds to its primary entrance. 
(r)  Miscellaneous structure. Outbuildings and/or utilities requiring metering that are required to have an address shall be given their own individual address, generally four to six numbers from the main residence. Outbuildings having their own access drives shall be assigned addresses following the basic rules for distance and direction. 
(s)  Wireless tower. A wireless tower shall be assigned one address determined by the basic rules for distance and direction.

b.  Location of existing taps. 
1.  The city will locate unused existing sewer taps at no charge for location service. 
2.  When buildings are razed, the person responsible for the demolition shall locate the existing building sewer at the property line and call the city public works department to reference the tap. No charge is made for this service. When the building sewer is not located at the property line and the city public works department has to make additional trips to reference the tap, the additional cost will be billed to the person responsible for demolition. 
c.  Reuse of existing taps. Taps will be reused by the next occupant provided the tap is in good condition and sufficient in size, as determined by the superintendent of the sewer systems division. The tap reuse fee as established by ordinance or resolution of the board of commissioners from time to time, and made available for public examination in the offices of the public works department and the city clerk, will be assessed. 
d.  Locations subject to backup conditions. At locations where backups are known or are expected to occur, the director of engineering will recommend in writing the installation of a manhole containing a plug valve and a check valve for backflow prevention. Where backups are known to occur, the city will provide all equipment and labor to make the installation if the property owner will furnish all materials. 
At undeveloped locations where the director of engineering has reason to believe back-up conditions may occur, the director of engineering will recommend in writing that the owner make the installation of the manhole and valves at the owner's expense. Subsequent flooding damages will not be the responsibility of the city if the owner does not make the installation. If the owner later experiences backup conditions, the owner will pay the total cost, if he or she desires to have the backflow prevention installed. 
(2)  Construction by city forces. 
a.  All taps connecting to any sewer maintained, owned or controlled by the city will be installed by city forces or an authorized contractor. The work order shall constitute the permit.

Paved street. 
Existing tap reuse. 
The appropriate fees shall be as established by ordinance or resolution of the board of commissioners, from time to time and made available for public examination in the office of the public works department. 
b.  Where the cost of the sewer was either not assessed against the abutting property or was held in abeyance, the sewer tap fee shall be the actual assessment plus the appropriate tap fee as established by ordinance or resolution of the board of commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the public works department. If the actual assessment is unknown, the tap fee shall be the current maximum sanitary sewer assessment rate applied to the abutting footage plus the appropriate tap fee. 
c.  Where the sewer is located outside the city limits, the sewer tap fee shall be equal to the actual assessment (if it could have been made) plus the appropriate tap fee as established by ordinance or resolution of the board of commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the public works department. If the value of the actual assessment is unknown, then the tap fee shall be the current maximum sanitary sewer assessment rate applied to the abutting footage plus the appropriate tap fee. 
d.  For sewer extensions or new sewer systems being made by private developers, the developers will pay the entire costs of such extensions or developments. No "rebate" or charges for sewer taps will be made or collected by the city and rebated or refunded to the developers over any period of time, for, or under any circumstances. 
e.  Whenever the city has constructed in the past or does construct in the future any sanitary sewer line, the cost of which has not been assessed against the adjoining property owners, the director of public works shall determine and fix a sewer connection fee, in addition to the standard sewer tapping fee and sewer development fee, with respect to each property owner which shall be equal to the amount which would have been assessed against the property had the sewer line been constructed and assessed during the calendar year in which construction was completed, adjusted for inflation as measured by the consumer price index maintained by the United States government; provided, however, that the adjusted cost shall not be less than the actual original cost, nor more than twice the actual original cost. Any property owner tapping into the sanitary sewer line shall first pay the sewer connection fee, and other standard fees, so fixed and assessed. 
(d)  Construction. After all requirements for permits and fees have been met, all building sewers shall be constructed in strict accord with the city plumbing code. Building sewers outside the city limits, but which will connect to the city sewer, shall also conform to all city regulations.

Sec. 60-136. - Sewer extension policy. 
(a)  Existing development within 200 feet of city sewer, where capacity is available, is required to connect to city sewer if an existing septic tank or private sewer fails. The appropriate fees would be paid to the city for providing this service including tap fees, sewer development charge, and the cost of extending the sewer main to the property if required. The developer may be required by the director of engineering to hire a contractor to install the sewer main and tap. The work shall be inspected by the city and the developer would then pay the city a sewer development charge. 
(b)  New development within 200 feet of city sewer, where capacity is available, is required to connect to city sewer. The appropriate fees would be paid to the city for providing this service including tap fees, sewer development charges, and the cost of extending the sewer main to the property if required. The developer may be required by the director of engineering to hire a contractor to install the sewer main and tap. The work would be inspected by the city and the developer would then pay the city a sewer development charge. 
(c)  Areas not served by city sewer can obtain city sewer service in one of the following ways: 
(1)  Provided capacity is available and sewer service is within 1,000 feet of unserved property, property owners within the city limits may petition the city for sewer service. All property owners to be affected by the sewer extension would be notified of the petition by certified mail and would have 30 days to vote for or against the project. If 51 percent or more of the property owners to be affected are in favor of the project, the city commission by a majority vote could pass an ordinance to do the work and assess all property owners to be served by the extension. 
(2)  Provided capacity is available and sewer service is within 1,000 feet of unserved property located within the city limits, the city commission can pass an ordinance after a public hearing, for public health, safety, and welfare reasons, with a majority vote to extend sewer service to this area and assess all property owners to be served by the extension. 
(3)  Provided capacity is available and sewer service is located more than 1,000 feet from unserved property located within the city limits, but based on the existing development patterns and/or the existing land use map, the development density in the service area of the sewer extension is or could be 3.25 units per acre, the city commission may pass an ordinance, after a public hearing, for public health, safety, and welfare reasons, to extend sewer service to this area and assess all property owners to be served by the extension. 
(4)  A developer of property, inside the city limits, can submit plans to the director of engineering for approval to extend sewer service to a new development such as a subdivision. Sewer shall be extended to the limits of the property to allow future developments access to sewer. Upon approval of plans, the developer can hire a contractor, provided capacity is available to extend the sewer. Developer would pay for all costs with installing sewer within a new subdivision. Taps would be installed to the lots by the contractor. All development charges would be paid as building permits are issued. The city will pay for increased capacity, extra depth or increased pipe size if the director of engineering determines it necessary. 
(5)  Provided capacity is available, the county can request the city to provide sewer service to an unserved area located in the unincorporated part of the county. The county would pay the city for all costs of construction and all other associated costs. A sewer development charge would also be due as building permits are issued.

DIVISION 3. - USE REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 60-194. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
(a)  General prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
(b)  Specific prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater: 
(1)  Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21; 
(2)  Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 12.5, or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment; 
(3)  Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference (but in no case solids greater than 2.5 inches in any dimension); 
(4)  Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW; 
(5)  Wastewater having a temperature greater than 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius), or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius); 
(6)  Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through; 
(7)  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems; 
(8)  Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the director of public works in accordance with section 60-223; 
(9)  Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair; 
(10)  Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating the city's NPDES permit; 
(11)  Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations; 
(12)  Stormwater, surface water, groundwater, artesian well water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, condensate, deionized water, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the director of public works; 
(13)  Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes;

(16)  Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW; 
(17)  Fats, oils, or greases of animal or vegetable origin in concentrations greater than 100 mg/l, or other substances that will solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 35 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 degrees Celsius) and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65.6 degrees Celsius); or 
(18)  Wastewater causing repeat readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the POTW. 
Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. 
(Code 1985, §§ 14-65, 27-28; Ord. No. 91-132, § 1(28-8), 4-23-1991; Ord. No. 05-111, § 2, 6-29-2005) 
Sec. 60-195. - National categorical pretreatment standards. 
    The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR ch. 1, subch. N, §§ 403-471 are hereby incorporated. 
(1)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director of public works may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
(2)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director of public works shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(3)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
a.  Industrial user must develop a pilot testing program at the POTW. This program will include a pilot unit or a prototype treatment plant, of reasonable scale, to conduct treatment of actual influent wastewater, spiked with proportional synthetic mass quantities of expected concentration of the concerned contaminant. 
b.  User will present to the city a pilot testing program (PTP) plan with the following requirements: 
1.  A detailed description of the objectives of the PTP plan. Those objectives must be identified early in the planning process for the city's review. 
2.  Plan should also include: 
(i)  Extent of user's process problem related to permit's constituent limits. 
(ii)  Objectives of proposed process change or constituent level variance. 
(iii)  Design and operation plan of PTP plan. 
(iv)  Implementation schedule. 
(4)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
(Code 1985, § 14-66; Ord. No. 05-111, § 2, 6-29-2005) 
Sec. 60-196. - Local limits. 
(a)  The City of Albany Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) is designed to handle conventional organic pollutants derived from domestic discharges. The plant can also handle non-toxic organic loads to a certain degree. The city allows non-domestic users to discharge conventional pollutants such as five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 ), total suspended solids (TSS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in levels that do not offset the WPCP operation. Non-domestic users that discharge these pollutants are required to pay an additional user fee to the city on the basis of mass quantities (i.e., for every pound of BOD 5 and TSS) discharged to the sewer system. Therefore, the non-domestic users have the option to decide if it is more economical for them to install a pre-treatment system to reduce the BOD 5 and TSS loads or to pay the city the user fees to treat the wastewater loads at the WPCP. However, if any non-domestic user discharges conventional pollutants that may cause pass through and interference, then specific limits will be set by the city on a case-by-case basis. Non-domestic users that have a valid written discharge permit from the city will have specific requirements for conventional pollutants in their permits. Non-domestic dischargers without a permit must comply with the following maximum limits of conventional pollutants: 
Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 ) Equals 2,500 mg/l Chemical oxygen demand (COD) Equals 4,250 mg/l Total dissolved solids (TDS) Equals 1,000 mg/l Total suspended solids (TSS) Equals 2,000 mg/l Oil and grease (O&G) Equals 100 mg/l  
(b)  In addition, this article limits the discharge of the following pollutants for all users. These limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following (instantaneous maximum allowable discharge limits, parts per billion, µ/l):

DIVISION 9. - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 

Sec. 60-387. - Treatment upsets. 
(a)  Any industrial user which experiences an upset in operation that places it in a temporary state of noncompliance, which is not the result of operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation, shall inform the director of public works thereof immediately upon becoming aware of the upset. Where such information is given orally, a written report thereof shall be filed by the user within five days. The report shall contain: 
(1)  A description of the upset, its cause and impact on the discharger's compliance status; 
(2)  The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of noncompliance, and if the noncompliance is continuing, the time by which compliance is reasonably expected to be restored; 
(3)  All steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of such an upset. 
(b)  An industrial user which complies with the notification provisions of this section in a timely manner shall have an affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought by the director of public works for any noncompliance with this article, or an order or permit issued hereunder by the user, which arises out of violations attributable to and alleged to have occurred during the period of the documented and verified upset. 
(c)  The affirmative defense shall be in accordance with the specifications presented in 40 CFR 403.16. An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause of the upset: 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
(3)  The industrial user has submitted the information described in subsection (a) of this section to the director of public works within the time limits specified therein. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  In the usual exercise of prosecutorial discretion, city enforcement personnel should review any claims that noncompliance was caused by an upset. No determinations made in the course of the review constitute final city action subject to judicial review. Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.

(1)  The said sewer service charge shall be based upon the quantity of water used by the said premises or facility therein or thereon as the same is measured by a water meter or meters there in use, or as otherwise currently established. 
(2)  The monthly sewer service charge for industrial/commercial usage shall consist of the base monthly charge plus a charge per total pounds of BOD plus a charge per total pounds of TSS as determined by sampling and a charge per 1,000 gallons of water, including adjustments thereto, consumed within the county whether within or without the corporate limits of the city. The amount of these charges shall be established by ordinance or resolution of the board of city commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the public works department. 
(3)  The monthly sewer service charge for the industrial/commercial usage with no sampling history shall consist of the base monthly charge plus a combined charge per 1,000 gallons consumed based on consumption of BOD and TSS. The amount of these charges shall be established by ordinance or resolution of the board of city commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the public works department. 
(4)  The monthly sewer service charge for residential usage shall consist of the base monthly charge plus a combined charge per 1,000 gallons consumed based on consumption of BOD and TSS. The average consumption billed during the months of January, February, and March will be used for computing the sewer service charge for the next 12 months. For new residential billings with no consumption history, billing will be based on a consumption of 6,000 gallons per month. The amount of these charges shall be established by ordinance or resolution of the board of city commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the public works department. 
(5)  Water used from private sources shall be metered as required in the independent water supply subsection (d) of this section and the city sewer service charge shall be the applicable charge for industrial/commercial or residential usage. 
(d)  Independent water supply; installation of meter. In the event a lot, parcel of land, premises or facility discharging sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly into the city's sewer system, or which ultimately enters the sewer system, is supplied either whole or in part, with water from wells, or any source other than the Albany Water, Gas, and Light Commission, then such wells or other source of supply shall be registered with the Albany Water, Gas and Light Commission and, if the water from said wells or other supply is not measured by a water meter, the owner or occupant shall, at his or her own cost, install and maintain a meter or meters on said supplies in such a location and in such a manner as is satisfactory to the Albany Water, Gas and Light Commission. These meters shall serve as a control for the establishment of the sewer service charge and shall be read monthly or bimonthly by members of the Albany Water, Gas and Light Commission. In selected cases, certain industries may read and report these readings to Albany Water, Gas and Light Commission. 
(e)  Additional meters. Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the director of public works that a significant portion of the water as measured by the water meter or meters does not enter the sewer system, then the director of public works may require or permit the installation of additional meters or other devices as may be deemed necessary to establish that portion that does enter the sewer system, and the corrected meter flow will be used for billing of the sewer service charge. All such additional facilities will be provided by the owner of the premises concerned or other interested parties at no expense to the city. 
(f)  More than one residential unit served by a single meter. When more than one residential unit is served by single meter, the sewer service charge shall consist of the base monthly charge for each unit plus a combined charge per 1,000 gallons consumed based on consumption, BOD, and TSS. The average consumption billed during the months of January, February, and March shall be used for computing the sewer service charge for the next 12 months. 
(g)  Establishment of categories of industries and means of setting fees. Industries discharging less than 100,000 gallons per month may be grouped in categories according to SIC classification for the purpose of sampling and billing. A representative sample will be made of selected establishments within the category and an average sewage strength determined for that category. All establishments will then be billed for the amount of their discharge at the strengths determined for that category.

DIVISION 2. - CONTROL OF BACKFLOW AND CROSS-CONNECTION 

Sec. 60-486. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this division is to protect the public potable water distribution system supplied by the water, gas and light commission (WGL) from the possibility of pollution or contamination by containing within its customers' internal or private water systems such pollutants or contaminants which could backflow into the public potable water system. 
(b)  This division also provides for the maintenance of a continuing program for backflow prevention and cross-connection control, which will systematically and effectively prevent potential contamination or pollution of the public potable water distribution system and to provide penalties for the violation or noncompliance of the provisions of this division. 
(c)  As drinking water quality standards are increasing in the state, a greater focus is now being given to the prevention of contamination of water distribution systems. Federal and state agencies have regulated cross-connection control and back-flow prevention for a long period of time. These regulations require the water purveyor to take measures to ensure compliance and assist in the protection of the water supply and public health. 
Sec. 60-487. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Air gap means the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture or other device and the flood level rim of the vessel. An approved air-gap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe, measured vertically, above the top of the overflow rim of the receiving vessel and in no case less than one inch. 
    Approved means accepted by the WGL as meeting an applicable specification stated or citied in this division, or as suitable for the purposed use. 
    Auxiliary water supply means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public potable water supply. These waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor has no sanitary control. 
    Backflow means the reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either backpressure or backsiphonage. 
    Backflow assembly, backflow device, or backflow preventer means an approved device designed to prevent backflow. Approved devices shall be as follows: 
(1)  Double check valve assembly means an assembly of two independently operating approved check valves with tightly closing shut-off valves on each end of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of each check valve. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications as determined by a laboratory and field evaluation program resulting in an approval of a recognized and approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies (e.g., The University of Southern California Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research). To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible for in-line testing and maintenance. 
(2)  Double check valve detector check assembly shall have the same requirements as a double check valve assembly, but shall be provided with a metered bypass to detect the flow of water through the assembly. 
(3)  Reduced pressure principle assembly means an assembly of two independently acting approved check valves, together with a hydraulically operating mechanically independent pressure relief valve located between the check valves and at the same time below the first check valve. The unit shall include properly located test cocks and tightly closing shut-off valves at each end of the assembly. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications as determined by a laboratory and field evaluation program resulting in an approval of a recognized and approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies (e.g., The University of Southern California Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research). The assembly shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two check valves at an acceptable level less than the pressure on the public water supply of the device. At cessation of normal flow the pressure between the two check valves shall be less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. In case of leakage of either of the check valves, the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain the reduced pressure in the zone between the check valves by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere. To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible for in-line testing and maintenance and be installed in a location where no part of the device will be submerged. 
(4)  Reduced pressure principal detector check assembly shall have the same requirements as a reduced pressure principal assembly, but, shall be provided with a metered bypass to detect the flow of water through the assembly. 
    Backpressure means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances under pressure into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from any source other than the intended source. 
    Backsiphonage means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from any other source other than its intended source caused by sudden reduction of pressure in the potable water supply system. 
    Certified tester means a person who has met the requirements set forth by the state environmental protection division to test backflow prevention assemblies. 
    Contamination means an impairment of the quality of the potable water by sewage industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials to a degree which creates an actual or potential hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease. 
    Consumer, user, means anyone that uses the water provided and delivered by the WGL water distribution system. 
    Cross-connection means any actual or potential connection, link, or structural arrangement between the public potable water supply distribution system and any other source or system through which it would be possible to introduce into any part of the public potable water supply system any used water, liquids, mixtures or substances. 
    Cross-connection controlled means a connection between the public potable water distribution system and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the protection required. 
    Cross-connection controlled by containment means the installation of one approved backflow prevention assembly immediately downstream of the water meter, service connection or at the point where WGL loses sanitary control. 
    Customer, user, means anyone who purchases the water provided and delivered by the WGL water distribution system. 
    Fire line means a water service that provides water from the public water system for the purpose of supplying water for fire protection equipment (e.g., fire hydrants or fire sprinkler systems).

    Hazard, degree of, shall be derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the public potable water distribution system: 
(1)  Hazard, health, means any condition, device or practice in the water supply system and it's operation which could create, or in the judgment of the WGL, may create a danger to the health and well-being of the water consumer. 
(2)  Hazard, pollution, means an actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the water system or to the portability of the public or the consumer's potable water system which would constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or its appurtenances, but, would not be dangerous to the health or well-being of the consumer. 
    Hotbox means a box or other similar device built specifically for the purpose of protecting a backflow prevention assembly from freezing and from environmental elements. 
    Industrial fluids means any fluid or solution which may be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration such as would constitute a health, system pollution or plumbing hazard if introduced into the public potable water distribution system. 
    Pollution means the presence of any foreign substance, organic, inorganic or biological, in water which tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a hazard or impair the usefulness or quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect such waters domestic use. 
    Water meter means any device placed into service by WGL to determine the amount of water being used through the water service connection to a premises. 
    Water, nonpotable, means water which is not safe for human consumption or is no longer under the sanitary of WGL.

If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the service connection means the downstream end of the meter. There should be no unprotected take-offs between the water meter and backflow prevention assembly located at the point of delivery to the customer's water system. Service connection shall also include water service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency service connections from the public potable water distribution system. 
    Water system means that system which is made up of two parts, the board of water, gas and light commissioners system and the customer's system, as follows: 
(1)  The board of water, gas and light commissioners water system shall consist of the source facilities and the distribution system, and shall include all those facilities of the water system under complete control of the water, gas and light commission, up to the point where the customer's system begins. 
(2)  The source shall include all components of the facilities used in the production, treatment, storage and delivery of the water to the distribution system. 
(3)  The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the customer's system. 
(4)  The customer's system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the WGL distribution system which are used in conveying WGL delivered domestic water to its point of use. 
    Water, used, means any water supplied by WGL through the public potable water distribution system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of WGL.

Sec. 60-488. - Responsibility. 
    The water, gas and light commission (WGL) shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the public potable water service connection. If the WGL requires, now or in the future, an approved backflow prevention assembly to protect its water distribution system, the WGL shall give notice, in writing, to the customer to install an approved backflow prevention assembly at each service connection to such customer's premises. The customer must take necessary arrangements to install or to have installed at his or her own expense, an approved backflow assembly immediately downstream of the water meter or water service connection. Failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to install, have tested and maintain such assembly shall constitute a grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met. 
Sec. 60-489. - Requirements. 
(a)  No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by federal and state laws and regulations and WGL's control of backflow and cross-connections ordinance. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow prevention assembly required by this division is not installed, tested and maintained, at the customer's expense, or if it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed or by-passed, or if an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected satisfactorily. 
(b)  The customer's system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of WGL to determine whether cross-connections or other sanitary hazards including violations of this ordinance exist. When such a condition becomes known, the WGL shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the conditions in compliance with federal, state and city statutes and regulations relating to plumbing and water supplies. 
(c)  An approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed, at the customer's expense, on each service line to the customer's water system immediately downstream of the water meter, service connection or at the point at which the WGL loses sanitary control. 
(d)  It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premise where backflow prevention devices are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per year. In those instances where the WGL deems the hazard to be great enough, more frequent inspection intervals may be required. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by a certified tester. It shall be the duty of the WGL to see that theses tests are done in a timely manner. The customer-user shall notify the WGL in advance when the tests are undertaken so that WGL representatives may witness the tests if so desired. These devices shall be repaired or replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever such devices are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs or replacements shall be kept and made available to the WGL.

(2)  The city desires not to create or impose undue hardship on lands which had impervious areas before the enactment of the first tree ordinance on May 12, 1992. Therefore for lands which do not meet the minimum tree density units and had impervious areas on May 12, 1992 the following applies: 
a.  The tree density units required are adjusted by a percentage. This percentage is the ratio of existing preserved and used impervious area which was on the site on May 12, 1992 divided by the overall area of the parcel being developed. The resulting percentage is multiplied by the TDU requirements for the site and that number is subtracted from the original TDU requirements to determine the reduced TDU requirements. 
b.  If requirement of subparagraph a. above causes an overall tree density unit total greater than the minimum tree density units of paragraph (1), then the required number of tree density units is reduced to require only the difference between the minimum tree density units of paragraph (1) and the existing tree density units. 
c.  The minimum required new tree density units shall not be less than ten percent or require less than one tree (whichever is greater) to be planted; 
(3)  Nothing in this division shall authorize the removal of existing trees as to reduce site tree units below 15 tree density units per site acre, and any such removal is prohibited. 
(b)  Sites with new paved parking areas. 
(1)  On sites where the tree density unit requirements have been met by trees retained on the site, any proposed or new parking areas shall be designed so as to provide for the preservation of existing trees, or living space for additional trees, to break up the expanse of the paved area(s) so that no new parking space shall be more than 75 feet from a tree density unit living space. 
(2)  On sites where the tree density unit requirements are not met by existing trees left on site, the site shall be designed to require planting tree density units in the expanse of the new parking area to meet the site's required tree density units; and at a ratio of not less than one tree density unit per 25 parking spaces, and so that no new parking space shall be more than 75 feet from a tree density unit living space. If there are tree density units remaining after meeting the previous requirement, then these tree density units may be placed at the applicant's discretion anywhere on the site as per section 62-37, (d) Tree density unit credit for new trees, (10) (11), and (12). 
(3)  Multi-level or covered parking areas are exempt from the requirements of subparagraphs (1) and (2) above. 
(c)  Off-site tree planting requirements/dedicated tree account. On sites to be altered having serious space limitations such as party walls, zero lot lines or other similar restrictions and having less than 7,500 square feet of paved area, the applicant may elect to: 
(1)  Where tree density unit requirements still remain, pay to the city $300.00 per remaining tree density unit. All checks or money orders shall be made out to the "City of Albany". The money shall be paid through the office of the city arborist into a dedicated tree account to be used only for the purchase of new and replacement trees and all materials needed to properly install the trees on public lands, rights-of-way, and on tree easements abutting public lands and rights-of-way, as designated by either the city arborist or the executive director of Keep Albany-Dougherty Beautiful. 
(2)  On sites to be developed with fewer than 100 parking spaces, when it is impractical to meet the criteria for replanting on the confines of the property to be developed, as determined by the arborist and/or engineering department, then applicant shall provide for replanting to occur on other properties within the city, public or private, that are acceptable to the city arborist, provided all other requirements are met. As an option to the provision for off-site replanting, the applicant may pay to the dedicated tree account $300.00 per tree density unit to plant the required number of replacement trees on public lands and rights-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 15-117, § 2(Exh. A), 5-26-2015) 
Sec. 62-37. - Tree density unit credits. 
(a)  TDU credits. To receive any TDU credits the minimum caliper, the minimum square footage of living space and the minimum living space radius are required. This applies to healthy, actively growing trees and requires approval by the city arborist. If a tree is in a location where a protection zone is needed or is determined to be needed, a protection zone is required to receive any TDU credits for that location. 
(b)  Protection zone. The physical barrier shall extend a minimum distance in all directions from the tree base at least one foot for each inch of trunk diameter. Physical barriers include but are not limited to: fencing, security screens, silt fence style of fencing, and construction warning fencing. Special conditions may warrant an adjustment to this requirement. The code enforcement officer with the city arborist's guidance shall set the special conditions and may grant adjustments to this paragraph on a case by case basis. 
(c)  Tree density unit credit for existing trees. Conversion from "diameter at breast height" (DBH) to "tree density unit" (TDU) is provided in the table below. To receive credit for the trees remaining on site, the minimum living space and minimum radius for living space are required. (see Appendix A). If the existing tree is a species not on the new tree list, approval must be obtained from the city arborist to receive credit. Existing trees identified as invasive species by the city arborist will not receive credit. The list of invasive species, identified by common name, includes: Catalpa Tree, Cottonwood, Royal Princess Tree, Cherry Laurel or Black/Wild Cherry, Hackberry or Sugarberry, Mimosa, Chinaberry, Tree of Heaven, and Chinese Tallow. The city arborist shall add other tree species to the list as needed.

(d)  Tree density unit credit for new trees. New trees are either approved shade trees or ornamental trees. Each listed tree has an individual tree density unit depending on the size, shape, and desirability. The minimum tree density unit is one-half and the maximum is one and one-half. Trees are designated as small, medium, or large relative to their potential size and the minimum living space requirement ranges from 100 to 400 square feet for any new trees planted outside the perimeter of parking areas (see Appendix A). A minimum radius of three feet living space for trees planted within the landscape islands of parking areas is required. 
(1)  Appendix A (at the end of this division) contains the listing of trees that are available to receive credit. The appendix contains common tree name, botanical name, minimum living space, tree density units, and general comments. 
(2)  The caliper of new trees is required to be between one and one-half and three and one-half inches, except that a pine tree caliper is required to be between one and one and one-half inches. 
(3)  Palm trees are assigned credit based on height, not caliper, and receive one-half TDU credit for each ten feet height increment. 
(4)  All new trees shall be planted on site between October 1 and April 15 unless an operational underground or drip irrigation system exists in place or the city arborist grants permission otherwise. 
(5)  Trees not on the list are required to be reviewed and approved by the city arborist prior to any tree permit application submittal. 
(6)  At least one-half of the new trees shall be from the shade tree class regardless of whether planting is for the purpose of meeting parking area requirement or TDU requirement. 
(7)  No more than one-third of the new trees shall be from any one species regardless of whether planting is for the purpose of meeting parking area requirement or TDU requirement. 
(8)  For a new tree surrounded by existing or new pavement, the minimum required living space is 150 square feet for all species. 
(9)  Crape myrtles may be grouped together, in maximums of three per single living space, though the minimum living space becomes 150 square feet. 
(10)  Trees being placed for this requirement may not be placed in locations such as sight clear zones that may cause hazardous situations for traffic. 
(11)  Trees shall be placed such that full shape and height will be reached without trimming, cutting or altering. For example: a large shade tree (height over 40 feet) placed near or under a power line shall not be allowed. 
(12)  Trees shall not to be planted within ten feet of any existing or proposed natural gas or sanitary sewer lines and within five feet of any other existing or proposed underground utilities. 
(Ord. No. 15-117, § 2(Exh. A), 5-26-2015) 
Sec. 62-38. - Receiving a building permit or certificate of occupancy. 
(a)  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the city arborist has conducted the final inspection. 
(b)  Due to the restricted tree planting period (October 1 to April 15) an allowance is made for activities to be completed during the non-tree planting time. A bond or an irrevocable letter of credit may be posted with the city arborist which will allow the applicant to occupy or use the development before all requirements of this division are met. An example letter of credit shall be furnished by the city attorney upon request. 
(1)  The amount of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be $300.00 per required tree density unit. 
(2)  In no event shall a bond or irrevocable letter of credit be for a time period of longer than seven months. 
(3)  A bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be accepted only during the time of April 1 to October 1. 
(4)  A request for an extension of an existing bond or irrevocable letter of credit may only be done through the appeal process. A request for an extension appeal application does not exempt the bond or letter of credit from the original termination date of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit.

(b)  All taxicabs operated under the authority of this article, which charges are determined by mileage or by the length of time the vehicle is used, shall be equipped with a taximeter. The taximeter shall be fastened in front of the passengers, visible to them at all times day and night, and, after sundown, the face of the taximeter shall be illuminated. All taximeters shall be installed, properly connected and repaired as prescribed by the manufacturer of such meter. Each taximeter shall have thereon some device, which designates when the taximeter is engaged. Any taximeter shall be subject to inspection at any time by the director, any code enforcement officer or any employee of the city police department. 
(c)  Taxicabs operating with nonelectronic taximeters shall be furnished with a sign approved by the director immediately adjacent to the taximeter which explains the way the fare shall be calculated if the taximeter reaches its highest fare before the passenger's destination is reached. The sign shall be pointed out to the passenger by the driver at the beginning of the trip. 
(d)  A taximeter shall be equipped with a primary indicating element. 
(e)  Except when a taximeter is being cleared, the primary indicating elements shall be susceptible of advancement only by the rotation of the vehicle wheels or by the time mechanism. 
(f)  Except when a taximeter is being cleared, indications of fare shall be clearly visible at all times and at least ten millimeters in height for the fare and four millimeters in height for all other indications. 
(g)  When a taximeter designed to calculate fares upon the basis of a combination of distance traveled and time elapsed is operative with respect to fare indication, the fare-indicting mechanism shall be actuated by the distance mechanism whenever the vehicle is in motion at such a speed that the rate of distance revenue equals or exceeds the time rate and may be actuated by the time mechanism whenever the vehicle speed is less than this and when the vehicle is not in motion. Means shall be provided for the vehicle operator to render the time mechanism either operative or inoperative with respect to the fare-indicating mechanism. 
(h)  Whenever the indicating elements of a taximeter are set to indicate a charge for the hire of the vehicle, the character of the fare indication shall be clearly shown on the taximeter face. When a taximeter is cleared, the indication "not registering," "vacant" or an equivalent expression shall be shown. 
(i)  Whenever a single-tariff taximeter is set so as to register charges, the indication "registering," "hired" or an equivalent expression shall be shown. 
(j)  Whenever a multi-tariff taximeter is set so as to register charges, the basis for the particular tariff for which it is set shall be shown. 
(k)  Indications of fare shall be displayed through and entirely protected by glass or other suitable transparent material securely attached to the housing of the taximeter.

(n)  The several positions of the control level shall be mechanically defined and displacement from any of these positions shall be sufficiently obstructed that the accidental or inadvertent changing of the operating condition of the taximeter is improbable or controlled by a button or switch. Possible movement of this control lever to an operating position immediately following its movement to the cleared position shall automatically be displayed enough to permit the taximeter mechanism to come to complete rest in the cleared position. 
(o)  Adequate provisions shall be made for affixing lead and wire seals to a taximeter and to other parts required for service operation of a complete installation on a vehicle so that no adjustments, alterations or replacements affecting in any way the accuracy or indications of the device or the assembly can be made without mutilating the seals. The sealing means shall be such that it is not necessary to disassemble or remove any part of the device or of the vehicle to apply or inspect the seals. 
(p)  To determine compliance with distance tolerances, a distance test of a taximeter shall be conducted utilizing one or more of the following test methods: 
(1)  Road test. A road test consists of driving the vehicle over a precisely measured road course. 
(2)  Fifth wheel test. A fifth wheel test consists of driving the vehicle in a simulated road test; 150 pounds or 70 kilograms of test weights may be substituted in lieu of the second person. 
(q)  Maintenance and acceptance tolerances for taximeters shall be as follows: 
(1)  On overregistration, one percent of the interval under test. 
(2)  On underregistration, four percent of the interval under test, with an added tolerance of 100 feet or 30 miles whenever the initial interval is included in the interval under test. 
(r)  Maintenance and acceptance tolerances on individual time intervals shall be as follows: 
(1)  On overregistration, three seconds per minute (five percent). 
(2)  On underregistration, nine seconds per minute (15 percent) on the initial interval and six seconds per minute (ten percent) on subsequent intervals. 
(s)  When mounted upon a vehicle, a taximeter shall be so located that its face can be seen by a passenger from the rear compartment of the vehicle. Adequate lighting facilities shall be provided for so illuminating the face of the taximeter that the indications thereof may be conveniently read by the passenger and the face of the taximeter shall be so illuminated whenever the taximeter is in operation and artificial illumination is necessary for the convenient reading of its indications. 
(t)  The distance and time rates for which a taximeter is adjusted shall be given. 
(u)  A reinspection is required whenever a taximeter has been damaged or repairs that might in any way affect the accuracy of its indications have been made or any of the official security seals have been mutilated. Such device shall not thereafter be used until it has been officially examined and reapproved.

With regard to roadway, drainage, and utility requirements, alternate design standards may be approved by the planning commission, city engineer, the county director of public works, engineering director of water, gas and light commission, or director of traffic engineering; however, such changes shall be in accordance with sound engineering practices and for the purpose of addressing hardship and unsafe conditions which would result under the strict applications of the requirements of these regulations. 
(Code 1985, § 25-21; Ord. No. 93-142, § 1(art. IV, A), 6-22-1993) 
Sec. 25-22. - General design standards. 
    The subdivision of land including the arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets, alleys, cross-walks, easements, sites for parks, playgrounds, and schools or other land to be dedicated for public use shall conform to the comprehensive plan of the city and the county. Approval of the design of a proposed subdivision shall be considered on the basis of its relation to existing and platted streets, reasonable circulation of traffic within the subdivision and adjacent land, topographic conditions, run-off of stormwater, public convenience and safety, and appropriate relation to the proposed land uses of the areas to be served. 
(1)  Size and shape of land to be subdivided. 
a.  The size and shape of the land to be subdivided shall be sufficient and proper for land planning purposes and suitable in area and dimensions for the uses intended. 
b.  The plans for the subdivision of the property should incorporate into, and be compatible with, the existing and potential uses on property contiguous to the area to be subdivided. 
(2)  Design compatibility with natural features. 
a.  The design of every subdivision shall be compatible with the existing topography, drainage patterns, and other natural features on the site. 
b.  The design of every subdivision should conserve, wherever possible, isolated mature trees, wooded areas, watercourses, scenic views, ponds, floodplain areas, historical landmarks, and other features of the property, which, if preserved, would add to the attractiveness and value of the subdivision, neighborhood, or the city/county as a whole. 
(3)  Subdivision name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate or too closely approximate phonetically or in spelling the name of any other subdivision previously approved and/or recorded, except where the subdivision is a phase or addition of a large or existing development or is a resubdivision of a previously recorded subdivision. The planning commission shall have final authority to approve the name of the subdivision and phase or addition number. 
(4)  Lots. 
a.  Political boundaries. In general, lots shall be laid out so that they do not cross any political boundary. However, if a proposed subdivision is so located as to require or is proposed to have access provided through another county or is to be located partially within either the county or the city and partially within some other jurisdiction, the subdivider shall provide the planning commission with official assurances from such other jurisdictions that such access is, in fact, on a public thoroughfare. 
b.  Arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with these city/county regulations and in providing driveway access to buildings on such lots from an approved public or private street. 
c.  Lot specifications. 
1.  Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the zoning ordinance and the health department in areas not served by public water and sewer. 
2.  In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule shall provide a better street or lot plan. 
3.  The depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated, as established in the zoning ordinance. 
4.  In general, if there are easements down side lot lines of individual lots in a subdivision and a building site consists of more than one lot, the easement down the middle of interior lot line is voided or removed unless there has been some utility construction placed within the easement and the utility easement is relocated down the new property line. An administrative subdivision shall be filed removing the center lot line. 
5.  Lots abutting a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream shall have a minimum width and depth required to provide an adequate building site while providing front, side, and rear yards as required in the zoning ordinance. As required in the city/county floodplain management ordinance, the building finished floor elevation shall be one foot above the flood level as measured from the 100-year floodwater line. 
d.  Access. 
1.  All lots shall abut a public or approved private street as permitted by the provisions of these regulations. 
2.  Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from major or minor arterial streets or highways or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
3.  All subdivisions containing lots fronting on state highways shall be submitted to the department of transportation for approval. 
4.  Single business enterprises and multiple business developments considered to be high-traffic generators shall provide a cross access drive and pedestrian access to allow circulation between sites. 
e.  Driveway location. 
1.  Driveways shall be located so that there is adequate clear sight distance onto the abutting road, avoiding locations along the inside curve or below the crown of a hilltop on an arterial street. 
f.  Flag lots. Flag lots shall be allowed as follows: 
1.  Where the flag lot makes it possible to better utilize irregularly shaped properties or areas with resource limitations. 
2.  The "pole" portion of a flag lot shall be included as part of the lot area for the purpose of determining average lot area, and the "pole" shall have a minimum width at the street right-of-way of not less than 30 feet, provided that, where flag lots are used, there shall be at least two lots at any point of access for a total minimum joint frontage of 60 feet. 
3.  Flag lots shall not be permitted whenever their effect would be to increase the number of driveways taking access to a collector or arterial road. Shared driveways shall be used to eliminate additional points of access. This criterion prohibits one of the most common abuses, the use of flag lots to avoid the developmental costs of roads. These sites are best developed without flag lots, even if the cost of the lots is thereby increased, since controlling access reduces congestion on major roads. The shared driveway cut shall be provided by the developer and the driveway shall be constructed to the minimum depth necessary to serve all lots prior to recording the plat. 
4.  Minimum lot area for flag lots shall be at least twice that of the zoning district in which the flag lot is located, except in the AG district where the minimum lot size shall remain ten acres. 
5.  Side and rear yard requirements shall be met on the lot excluding the "pole" portion of the lot. 
6.  The maximum length of the "pole" portion of the lot shall be no more than five times the lot width measured at the building line. This may be greater due to unusual circumstances when approved by the planning commission. 
7.  A minimum frontage of 30 feet shall apply to lots which front upon the turn-around portion of a cul-de-sac. 
(5)  Blocks. 
a.  Design. 
1.  The length, width, and shape of blocks shall be determined with due regard for the following: 
i.  Provisions for adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of uses contemplated. 
ii.  The size requirements of lot size within the applicable zoning district. 
iii.  Need for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of the street traffic. 
2.  Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to arterial streets, railroads, water-courses, drainageways, or other property lines of the subdivision. 
3.  No block should exceed 1,800 feet in length except where required by unusual topographic conditions. 
4.  In blocks exceeding 1,200 feet in length, the planning commission may require a 20 foot-wide right-of-way or easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, and/or a paved sidewalk. 
(Code 1985, § 25-22; Ord. No. 93-142, § 1(art. IV, B), 6-22-1993; Ord. No. 94-133, § 1, 6-29-1994; Ord. No. 94-158, § 1, 10-11-1994; Ord. No. 97-131, § 1, 7-8-1997; Ord. No. 99-137, 12-14-1999) 
Sec. 25-23. - Streets. 
(a)  General standards. 
(1)  All streets. All streets in the subdivision shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed street system as established on the DARTS plan and comprehensive plan of the city and the county. 
(2)  Major elements. Major elements of the street system should be used to help define and buffer different land use areas, enhancing their identity and cohesiveness. 
(3)  Minimize length, intersections and paved area. To the extent feasible, the lineal length of streets, the number of street intersections, and the paved area within intersections should be minimized. 
(4)  The design of the street system. The design of the street system of the subdivisions shall be in accordance with table I-A and I-B-minimum standards for street design and construction-and shall be in accordance with the engineering standards herein. 
(5)  Adequate drainage structures. Adequate drainage structures shall be provided. The design, installation, and construction of drainage structures shall comply with the engineering standards herein and the city and the county floodplain management ordinance. 
(6)  Private streets. Private streets shall be permitted if they have an alignment and width consistent with engineering and planning commission recommendations, have adequate easements for utilities and access and are local in nature and designed to prevent through traffic. Prior to final plan approval, the applicant shall file a release of maintenance agreement with the city/county attorney, releasing the relevant governing body from any present or future maintenance of all private streets. The perpetual maintenance of private streets shall be guaranteed by the establishment of a homeowners' association, other responsible association, or other instrument. In all cases, the instrument of street maintenance shall be approved by the planning commission. When built, private streets shall have signs posted indicating they are private streets. If, in the future, the property owners desire the streets to become public, they shall be improved to existing city/county standards prior to acceptance by the governing body. Private street design and construction standards shall be submitted to the city/county engineer for approval. In no case shall land reserved for right-of-way be less than required for a similar public street, nor shall the road width be less than required for a public road of similar classification. 
(7)  Private access drives. Private access drives shall be permitted to serve landlocked lots only where landlocked lots were in existence prior to the enactment of these regulations or are a result of special physical features that otherwise render the property undevelopable. No more than one such drive shall be approved per subdivision development and must be approved as part of the original plat. 
(8)  Listed thoroughfares. Listed thoroughfares to which driveway access is restricted or limited by these regulations are included in appendix 2 and regulated as follows: 
a.  Where a subdivision for single-family and two-family lots will abut or contains any of the thoroughfares listed in appendix 2, the planning commission shall require that such single-family and two-family lots not have direct vehicular access to such listed thoroughfares except in the cases of: 
1.  Subdivisions of property to accommodate the residential needs of family members of the owner of a large tract of land; in which case, minimum frontages are to be as close to that required by exception 3. below as practical; however, when such frontage cannot be met, the planning commission may, upon the recommendation of the county director of public works or such person as may be directed to act as the county traffic engineer, approve lesser frontages and driveway spacing as low as that permitted in exception 4. below; 
2.  When there are particular and unusual physical conditions not caused by the owner which would result in a hardship as distinguished from a mere inconvenience; 
3.  Where any lot created will have a minimum frontage of 200 feet and only one driveway per lot; or 
4.  Where the subdivision will have minimum lot frontages of 200 feet for all corner lots and 150 feet for all noncorner (interior) lots and the plat will contain restrictive covenants requiring the use of joint (common) or abutting driveways or parallel driveways which are no more than six feet from the property line. 
    Generally, this would mean that lots should not front said listed thoroughfares; however, any design solution which satisfies the intent of restricting direct vehicular access to such thoroughfares would be acceptable. Potential design solutions to achieve this purpose include: 
i.  Use of marginal access streets wherein land abutting a listed thoroughfare is separated from such thoroughfare by a planted or grassed strip of land and a marginal access street; 
ii.  Use of reverse frontage lots wherein lots back up to a listed thoroughfare and front on and have access only to a local or minor collector street running approximately parallel to the listed thoroughfare. Such reverse frontage lots shall have a no-access reservation (at least 15 feet wide) along their rear property line and immediately adjacent to any abutting listed thoroughfare; 
iii.  Using one or more cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets or short looping streets wherein lots front and only have access to such streets and those streets are only entered from and generally designed at right angles to a street not a listed thoroughfare and laid out approximately parallel to any listed thoroughfare; and 
iv.  Other such design solutions as may be devised to achieve the same results. The use of deep lots with rear service alleys and a no access reservation along the front of the lot or the use of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets or short looping streets having direct access to a listed thoroughfare is not considered a good solution and should be approved only when unique circumstances make other solutions unacceptable. 
    Where a commercial or industrial subdivision will abut or contain a listed thoroughfare, the planning commission may require the use of such design standards as listed above. 
b.  Any lot on a designated listed thoroughfare but not a state highway which is to be used for residential purposes containing three or more dwelling units per building shall be reviewed and approved as a business use property. 
c.  Single business enterprise on a single lot on a "listed thoroughfare." 
1.  Traffic movements confined primarily to on-site employees of any type business of no more than 40 employees are permitted driveways as follows: 
i.  Corner lots. One two-way on the principle thoroughfare and one two-way on the cross street; or 
ii.  Interior lots. One two-way driveway or two one-way driveways. 
2.  Traffic movements consisting primarily of in-and-out customer activities with any type business except service stations and convenience stores with gas and characteristics shall be permitted driveways as indicated below: 
i.  No more than 50 on-site parking spaces or are located on sites of less than 300 feet [of] frontage are permitted driveways as follows: 
aa.  Corner lots. One two-way driveway on the principle thoroughfare or side cross street and one two-way or two one-way driveways on the other remaining street; or 
bb.  Interior lots. One two-way driveway or two one-way driveways. 
ii.  More than 50 on-site parking spaces and are on sites having a minimum of 300 feet [of] frontage are permitted driveways as follows: 
aa.  Corner lot. Two two-way driveways on the principle thoroughfare or side cross street and one two-way or two one-way driveways on the other remaining street; or 
bb.  Interior lot. Two two-way driveways. 
cc.  Service stations and convenience stores which include gas and oil sales and have a minimum frontage of 150 feet shall be permitted no more than one curb opening for each 50 feet of frontage or major fraction thereof along any street. 
No driveway or curb opening shall be located nearer than ten feet to any corner or exterior lot line, as measured along the property line. No driveway shall be located nearer than 30 feet, as measured along the property line, to any other driveway giving access to or from the same service station. 
cc [dd.]  In all cases, driveways are to be located as far as practical from an inter-section. 
d.  Multiple businesses on either corner or interior lots or tracts on a "listed thoroughfare." The following applies to as many said thoroughfares as the property borders and any business use. 
1.  Sites with up to 300 feet of frontage are permitted one two-way driveway or two one-way driveways. 
2.  Sites with more than 300 feet and up to 1,000 feet of frontage are permitted two two-way driveways. 
3.  Sites with more than 1,000 feet and up to 2,000 feet of frontage are permitted three two-way driveways. 
4.  Sites with more than 2,000 feet and up to 3,000 feet of frontage are permitted three two-way driveways or two one-way driveways and one multilaned driveway. 
5.  Sites with more than 3,000 feet of frontage will be permitted driveways on a case-by-case basis upon study and recommendation of the person designated to act as the county traffic engineer and/or state traffic and safety engineer as appropriate. 
    In the above instances (1.-5.), driveways of corner lots or tracts shall be as far as practical from the intersection. 
h. [6.]  (Driveway access for listed streets in the city, not under the jurisdiction of the state Department of Transportation (GDOT), is regulated by h(5)[e.]-(9)[i.]. Listed streets within the Central Business District are exempt from these regulations.) 
(e) [e.]  Where a subdivision for single-family and two-family lots will abut or contains any of the urban principal or minor arterials listed in Appendix 3, the planning commission shall require that such single-family and two-family lots not have direct vehicular access to such listed urban principal or minor arterials. Access must be from an interior local street or frontage street. 
    The planning commission may, upon the recommendation of the city Engineer, allow direct access to listed principal or minor arterials under the following conditions: 
(a)  Subdivision of property to accommodate the residential needs of family members of the owner of a large tract of land; 
(b)  When there are particular and unusual physical conditions, not caused by the owner, which would result in a hardship as distinguished from a mere inconvenience. 
    The following minimum frontages for listed urban principal or minor arterials are allowed if the planning commission grants direct access based on (a) or (b) above; any lot created will have a minimum frontage of 450 feet and only one driveway per lot; or where the subdivision will have minimum lot frontages of 300 feet for all corner lots and 250 feet for all non-corner (interior) lots and the plat will contain restrictive covenants requiring the use of joint (common) or abutting driveways, or parallel driveways which are no more than six feet from the property line. 
(f) [f.]  Subdivision of property on a listed urban principal or minor arterial, which is to be used for residential purposes containing three or more dwelling units per building shall follow access requirements outlined in (7) for commercial and industrial subdivisions. 
(g) [g.]  Where a commercial or industrial subdivision will abut or contain an urban principal or minor arterial listed in Appendix 3, the planning commission shall require that such lots follow driveway access guidelines established by the GDOT document "Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control." These guidelines are attached as appendix A. 
(h) [h.]  Where any lot abuts or contains a collector listed in appendix 3, the planning commission shall require that such lots follow driveway access guidelines established by the GDOT document "Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control." These guidelines are attached as appendix 4. 
(i) [i.]  An appeal for additional access for (7) and (8) above must be made to the city engineering department according to that department's procedure. 
(9)  Improvement plan and grading requirements. Streets shall be graded and improved to conform to the city and county construction standards and engineering specifications and shall be approved as to design and constructions by the city engineer and the county director of public works. 
(10)  Alleys. Alleys may be required in high density residential, commercial and industrial developments. Where provided, alleys shall have a minimum right-of-way (ROW) width of 25 feet and a minimum pavement width of 20 feet. (See table I-A, I-B-minimum standards for street designs.) 
(11)  Dead-end streets (temporary). If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be extended to the boundary line of the property being subdivided. A temporary turnaround of a design approved by the city engineer and the the county director of public works shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the subdivision plat that land required outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutting owners whenever the street is continued. 
(12)  Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs in residential areas should not be longer than 1,800 feet, but may be approved for longer lengths depending on design constraints. Cul-de-sacs may be built with standard circular turnarounds or with standard circular turnarounds with center islands. If a cul-de-sac is built with standard circular turnaround with center island, the island shall be landscaped with grass or trees and maintained by a homeowners association. All dead-end streets shall be provided with a cul-de-sac. 
(13)  Sight triangles (clear sight distance). Where any street intersection is created which would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility within the sight triangle, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to comply with the sight distance requirements of these regulations and shall not erect any sign or improvement which would preclude safe sight distance. 
(14)  Curb and gutter. 
a.  Where curb and gutter are constructed, vertical curb shall be used on all collector streets. Mountable (rolled) curb may be used on local streets if its use does not adversely affect storm drainage, if approved by the city engineer. (Design specifications for curb are contained in the appropriate jurisdiction's constructions specifications). 
b.  Where provided, curb and gutter shall be constructed based on city/county construction standards and specifications. 
(15)  Roadside ditches. Where curb and gutter is not provided, drainage ditches shall be constructed to provide for proper drainage. Drainage ditches shall have side slopes no steeper than 3:1, and shall be grassed and mulched, sodded, or paved depending on the intended design velocity of stormwater. Drainage ditch construction shall conform to the specifications detailed in applicable city/county construction standards. 
(16)  Utility areas. Utilities shall generally be located within the right-of-way and/or easements on both sides of and parallel to the street in accordance with table I-A, I-B. Utility areas shall be planted with grass or ground cover or treated with other suitable cover material. 
(17)  Street names and signs. No street name shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the name of existing streets. Therefore, developers are required to submit their proposed street names to the planning commission. Duplication of street names between the city and county are not to occur except where a street is planned as a continuation of a street between the two jurisdictions. A street which exists or is planned as a continuation of a street shall bear the same name. The planning commission shall have final authority to approve street names in new subdivisions. At least two street name signs shall be placed at each four-way intersection and one at each "T" intersection. Signs shall be free of visual obstructions. Street name signs shall be furnished and installed by the city or county. These shall be paid for by the subdivider prior to the recording of the final plat. 
(18)  House numbers/street addresses. House numbers or street addresses shall be provided by the planning commission after preliminary plat approval and a copy of the final plat showing the approved house numbers or street addresses shall be submitted along with the final plat. The planning staff may approve minor corrections or modifications at final review. 
(19)  Reserve strips. The creation of fee simple reserve strips to preclude access shall not be permitted. Streets roughly parallel to the boundary line of the subdivision shall be located either on that boundary line or not less than one lot depth from said boundary line. All streets intended to provide the subdivision and adjacent parcels of property with means of ingress and egress shall extend to the boundary line of the subdivision. 
(b)  Design criteria. In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width, and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting, sanitation, and road maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and to avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards are hereby required. The following design criteria are ideal standards that should be the goal of all design. However, specific site conditions may dictate these goals to be unattainable. In such cases, flexibility will be allowed. 
(c)  Design layout. 
(1)  General concepts. 
a.  All streets shall be located in relation to existing topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety, and to efficient drainage and utility systems. 
b.  All streets shall be properly related to special traffic generators such as industrial business districts, schools, churches, and shopping centers, to population densities, and to patterns of existing and proposed land uses. 
(2)  Residential streets. 
a.  A residential area should be conveniently accessible from arterial streets. 
b.  Residential streets shall provide safe and convenient access to housing. 
c.  Local streets shall be so laid out as to discourage high speed or through traffic, but the design shall be logical and comprehensive to a motorist or a pedestrian attempting to travel to and through the subdivision. 
d.  Curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or looped streets shall be used where such will result in a more desirable layout. 
e.  Layout of residential areas should be planned to avoid future need to widen any local streets or minor collector streets. 
(3)  Nonresidential streets. 
a.  Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not normally be extended through adjacent existing or potential residential areas. 
b.  The streets and other accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provisions of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas, so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian. 
c.  Streets extending parallel or approximately parallel to a railroad right-of-way should: 
1.  Be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure depth for commercial or industrial sites, and 
2.  Be at a distance at least 50 feet from the railroad right-of-way when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade, or be at such other distance as shall be necessary, when intersecting a street which will be grade separated when crossing the railroad. 
(4)  Design speeds for streets. Part of the criteria to be used in the layout and design of streets shall be the following vehicular speed design factors: 
Arterial 45-55 miles-per-hour Major collector* 40-45 miles-per-hour Minor collector* 30-45 miles-per-hour Local 25-30 miles-per-hour  
*The lower speed within the range shown shall apply specifically to residential areas while commercial and industrial area streets may use the full speed range depending on specific requirements of the development. 
NOTE-The above vehicular speed design factors shall not necessarily be used to establish speed limits. 
(5)  Intersections. 
a.  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, but in no case shall any intersection be less than 75 degrees. An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least one 100 feet therefrom. 
b.  Intersections on the inside of a curve, on a hilltop, or a point slightly below a hilltop shall be avoided. 
c.  An intersection of more than two streets shall not be permitted without approval of the planning staff, traffic engineer, city engineer or the county public works director. 
d.  In nonresidential areas and along arterial streets, proposed new intersections shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any intersections on the opposite side of such street. 
e.  In cases of intersection off-sets, centerline jogs of less than 150 feet shall not be permitted whenever possible; however, major streets should be aligned to avoid off-sets altogether. 
(d)  A system of joint use driveways and cross access easements shall be established wherever feasible along "listed thoroughfares," and the building site shall incorporate the following: 
(1)  A continuous service drive or cross access corridor extending the entire length of each block served to provide for driveway separation. 
(2)  A design speed of ten miles per hour and sufficient width to accommodate two-way travel aisles designed to accommodate automobiles, services vehicles, and loading vehicles. 
(3)  Stub-outs and other design features to make it visually obvious that the abutting properties may be tied in to provide cross-access through a service drive.

Sec. 25-26. - Sewerage facilities. 
(a)  General requirements. State public health regulations and the city sewerage and pretreatment standards, as administered by the EPD and city, control the installation of sewerage facilities. The following are minimum requirements subject to EPD and the city approval. 
(1)  When an adequate public gravity flow sewer line is within 300 feet of the proposed development and it can be determined to be economically feasible, the applicant shall connect each lot to the system. It shall be considered economically feasible to connect a subdivision to a public sewer system when the total cost for sanitary sewer does not exceed the cost for septic tank system by more than 300 percent. 
(2)  When future upstream extensions are possible, sewer easements through the proposed development shall be required. 
(3)  Private disposal systems or treatment plants and septic tanks shall be approved by the county health department and if within the city limits shall be approved by the city. 
(4)  Installation of any sewer lines, laterals and mains shall be subject to the approval of the city engineer. 
(5)  A copy of the "as-built" sewer plans shall be submitted to the city engineer or the county director of public works.

(Code 1985, § 25-29; Ord. No. 93-142, § 1(art. IV, I), 6-22-1993) 
Sec. 25-30. - Monuments and markers. 
(a)  Preservation of existing monuments. All United States, state, county, or other official benchmarks, monuments, or triangulation stations in or adjacent to the subdivision shall be preserved. When a proposed improvement in a subdivision makes necessary the moving of benchmarks, monuments or stations, the authority having jurisdiction shall be notified and given sufficient time to take appropriate action. 
(b)  Placement of new monuments. Permanent reference monuments shall be placed at block corners and other points such as street intersections, lot corners, and angle points and shall be marked with a solid iron rod or an iron pipe not less than one-half inch in diameter, at least 18 inches long, driven flush with the ground. Removal and resetting of monuments by anyone other than a registered land surveyor is prohibited. The subdivision will be referenced to the Albany, the Dougherty Coordinate System (ADCCS) under the following circumstances: 
(1)  Any property corner is within 500 feet of an ADCCS monument. 
(2)  Any commercial or industrial subdivision of property over ten acres in size must be referenced to an ADCCS monument. 
(3)  Any residential subdivision of greater than ten acres and five lots or if public streets, water, and/or sewer to be constructed. 
    Subdivision or resubdivision of property located in a subdivision recorded since January 1, 1978, is exempt from this requirement unless any part of the property is within 500 feet of an ADCCS monument. 
    If an ADCCS monument is farther than two miles from any part of the subdivision, this requirement may be waived upon agreement of the city engineer and the director of the Albany Dougherty Planning Commission. 
    All references to ADCCS monuments are to be established through field surveys with permanent field notes available for inspection and review and with the same degree of accuracy as required for the subdivision. 
(Code 1985, § 25-30; Ord. No. 93-142, § 1(art. IV, J), 6-22-1993) 
Sec. 25-31. - Tree planting and preservation. 
    See the City of Albany Tree Ordinance, #92-124, as amended; no county standards (chapter 28, article III, section 28-31 et seq.). 
(Code 1985, § 25-31; Ord. No. 93-142, § 1(art. IV, K), 6-22-1993) 
Sec. 25-32. - Planned unit development. 
(a)  General. Planned unit development (PUD) is designed to provide developers with desirable gross densities, while requiring subdivision and site plan patterns to capitalize on topography and site features and to preserve common open space. Also, PUD can provide a variety of different uses and structure types that are effectively combined through the site planning process (see Illustration 4). 
(b)  Waiver of provisions of subdivision regulations. The zoning regulations contain provisions for a variety of residential, mixed use, and commercial PUDs. Provisions of these subdivision regulations may be waived by the planning commission and/or modified for PUD pursuant to the PUD district regulations. 
(c)  Design standards. PUD design standards are created individually for each development through a review and negotiation process that is designed to consider the unique nature of each PUD project. Design review criteria are based on general planning performance standards, and the criteria established in the applicable district regulations in the zoning regulations. The plans submitted and approved for PUD approval shall constitute general development plan approval. 
(Code 1985, § 25-32; Ord. No. 93-142, § 1(art. IV, L), 6-22-1993; Ord. No. 95-153, § 1, 11-14-1995) 
Sec. 25-33. - Platting standards. 
(a)  When lots/tracts are being subdivided from a larger parcel and the remainder parcel acreage is 40 acres or greater, the remainder parcel may not be surveyed at the discretion of the city county engineer and planning director. If not surveyed, the parcel shall be noted "parcel not surveyed at this time." 
(b)  All subdivisions shall be tied to a street intersection or other permanent corner subject to the approval of the city/county engineer when a (ADCCS) monument is not available as described in section 25-30(b).

ARTICLE III. - ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS 

Sec. 25-41. - Improvements and guarantees. 
    Before the final plat is approved by the planning commission, the subdivider shall be required to complete or provide improvement guarantees for all improvements as required in these regulations. The form of all guarantees shall be approved by the applicable city and/or county attorney. 
(1)  Completion of improvements. The city engineer or the the county director of public works shall certify in writing to the planning commission that all improvements required by the city or county have been satisfactorily installed or properly guaranteed and a deed submitted. 
(2)  Improvement guarantees. The subdivider shall provide improvement guarantees at the time of application for final plat approval if all required improvements have not been installed and approved as herein required. Such improvement guarantees shall be approved by the city engineer or the county director of public works as to amount and surety and be sufficient to secure to the board of city commissioners or board of commissioners of the county the satisfactory completion of all public improvements required by these regulations. Improvement guarantees may take the form of either a letter of credit, a bond, or a certified check or other form acceptable to the city/county attorney and the planning commission and shall be released only after the city or county has accepted the work. 
(3)  Costs of improvements. All required improvements shall be made by the subdivider, at his expense, without reimbursement by the city or county or by any improvements district therein. 
(4)  Failure to complete improvements. In those instances where an improvement guarantee has been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the terms of such guarantees, the city or county shall call the improvement guarantee due and collect all funds or require that all improvements be immediately installed regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the improvement guarantee is declared to be in default. If any of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the city's or county's construction standards and specifications, the subdivider shall be responsible for removing any defects and completing the improvements or forfeiting the guarantee. 
(Code 1985, § 25-41; Ord. No. 93-142, § 1(art. VI, A), 6-22-1993; Ord. No. 95-153, § 1, 11-14-1995) 
Sec. 25-42. - Inspection of improvements. 
    The city engineer or the the county director of public works shall provide for inspection of required improvements during and upon their completion and shall approve all such installations to ensure satisfactory compliance with provisions of these regulations. 
(Code 1985, § 25-42; Ord. No. 93-142, § 1(art. VI, B), 6-22-1993) 
Sec. 25-43. - Maintenance of improvements. 
    The subdivider shall be responsible for maintenance and warranty repairs constructed by the developer for a period of one year from either the completion of construction or the recording of the final subdivision plat, whichever is the latest. 
(Code 1985, § 25-43; Ord. No. 93-142, § 1(art. VI, C), 6-22-1993)

Appendix B - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the Floodplain Management Ordinance of the city, Ordinance No. 09-130, as adopted by the Board of City Commissioners on September 22, 2009. This ordinance repealed the prior floodplain management provisions which appeared at sections 25-101 through 25-162, as amended, in Chapter 25 ("Subdivision Regulations") of the 1985 Code. Amendments to this ordinance are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note to this ordinance indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors in this ordinance have been corrected without notation. The same system of capitalization and expression of numbers in text has been used in this ordinance as it appears in the Code of Ordinances. Additions made to this ordinance for clarity, such as consistent state statute citations and catchline modifications, are indicated by brackets.   In addition, Ord. 09-117, adopted April 28, 2009, approved and adopted the Albany Dougherty Flood Hazard Mitigation Plan. The Plan is not set out at length herein and is on file and available for inspection in the office of the city clerk. 

ARTICLE 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Section A. - Authorization. 
    Article IX, section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated [O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a)] have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and board of commissioners of Albany, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
Section B. - Findings of fact. 
1.  The flood hazard areas of the City of Albany are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
2.  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
Section C. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the intent of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
4.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage, and; 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
Section D. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this ordinance are: 
1.  To protect human life and health; 
2.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, street and bridges located in floodplains; 
6.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
7.  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area, and; 
8.  To insure that flood insurance will continue to be available to the residents of Albany. 
ARTICLE 2. - DEFINITIONS 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have it common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application. 
    Accessory use : a use of a nature customarily subordinate or incidental to, and located on the same parcel, as the principal use of any structure or property. 
    Addition (to an existing building): means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a fire wall. Any walled and roofed addition that is connected by a fire wall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls is new construction. 
    Appeal: means a request for a review of the planning and development services department's interpretation of any provision of this ordinance or a request for a variance. 
    Area of special flood hazard: is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    Base flood (regulatory flood): the flood having a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE): the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map for zones AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, V1-V30, and VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year. 
    Basement: that portion of a building having its flood grade below ground level on all sides. 
    Building: any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any occupancy or storage. 
    Critical facility: means any public or private facility, which, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life and health. Critical facilities include: 
(a)  Structures or facilities that produce, use, or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic, or water-reactive materials; 
(b)  Hospitals and nursing homes, and housing for the elderly, which are likely to contain occupants who may not be sufficiently mobile to avoid the loss of life or injury during flood and storm events; 
(c)  Emergency operation centers or data storage centers which contain records or services that may become lost or inoperative during flood and storm events; and 
(d)  Generating plants, and other principal points of utility lines. 
    Development: any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, or permanent storage of materials or equipment. 
    Elevated building: a non-basement building to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns (posts and piers), shear walls, or breakaway walls. 
    Existing construction: means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before August 15, 1977 [the effective date of the initial FIRM for that community]. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision: means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before August 9, 1977 [the effective date of the FIRST floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision: means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
    Fair market value: the value of property or structures, as used in the definition of "substantial improvement" shall mean, as determined by the tax assessor, either (a) before the improvement was started, or (b) if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. 
    Flood or flooding : 
1.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
a.  The overflow of inland waters; and 
b.  The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source. 
2.  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm or force of nature, such as a flash flood, or by some similarly unusual event which results in flooding as defined in (a) above.

For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after August 9, 1977 [the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision: means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after August 9, 1977 [the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
    Non-conforming floodway use: any residential, commercial, industrial, office institutional, or public building located within the floodway on the date of the adoption of these regulations, and which would not be permitted to be constructed within the floodway after the first date (August 9, 1977 in the City of Albany) of the adoption of this ordinance. Any use of land within a floodway existing on the first date of the adoption of this ordinance, and which will not be permitted as a new use within the floodway. 
    Non-conforming floodway fringe use: any structure that is located within the floodway fringe on the first date of the adoption of this ordinance and that does not meet standards for finished floor elevations and/or flood-proofing that apply to new construction in the floodway fringe. For example, the finished floor elevation of a single family residence might be three feet below the 100 year flood elevation; such a residence should be defined as a non-conforming floodway fringe use. 
    Person: any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association or any other organized group of persons, including state and local governments and agencies thereof.

The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure: a walled and roofed building that is principally above the ground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a manufactured home. The term includes a building while in the course of construction, alteration or repair. The term does not include building materials or supplies intended for use in construction, alteration or repair, unless such materials or supplies are within an enclosed building on the premises. The words "building" and "structure" shall have the same meaning for the purposes of this ordinance.

The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the building official and/or code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions: is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance: A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of these regulations, as provided in Article 4, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where specific enforcement of this ordinance would result in exceptional hardship. 
    Violation: means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

ARTICLE 6. - ESTABLISHMENT OF AREAS WITHIN THE FLOODPLAIN 

Section A. - General. 
    The floodplain within the City of Albany is hereby divided into three separate areas - the floodway, the floodway fringe, and other floodplain areas. 
Section B. - Floodway. 
1.  Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to the floodway as shown on the official flood maps. 
2.  Restrictions governing development in floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in article 3, section B, are areas designated as floodway. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge; 
b.  If article 6, section B(2)(a) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article 5. 
c.  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured home (mobile home) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of article 5, section A(2), and the elevation standards of article 5, section B(1) and the encroachment standards of article 6, section B(2)(a) are met. 
3.  Permitted uses. The following and other similar uses normally have a low flood damage potential. These uses are permitted within the floodway provided that they are not prohibited by the Albany-Dougherty County Zoning Ordinance or by any other ordinance, and provided that they do not require fill, dumping of materials or waste, or storage of materials or equipment. No use shall be permitted which acting along or in combination with existing or reasonably foreseeable future uses would result in an increase in the regulatory flood elevation in accordance with article 6, section B(2)(a). 
a.  Agricultural uses, including general farming, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, truck gardening, forestry, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting. 
b.  Non-structural industrial and commercial uses, including golf courses, tennis courts, driving range, archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat launching ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, game farms, fish hatcheries, shooting preserves, target ranges, trap and skeet ranges, hunting and fishing areas, hiking and horseback riding rails. 
4.  Special uses. The following uses may be permitted only upon application to the department of planning and development services and the issuance of a special use permit by the board of review as provided in article 4 of this ordinance, and provided the applicant demonstrates (by technical analysis) that he/she is in compliance with the provisions of article 6, section B(2)(a); that the use will not cause any increase in the regulatory flood level, and further provided that such uses are permitted at the proposed location by the Albany-Dougherty Zoning Ordinance: 
a.  Uses accessory to permitted or special uses; 
b.  Circuses, carnivals and similar transient amusement or entertainment; 
c.  Drive-in theaters, lots for the sale of new and used cars, trucks, farm equipment, campers and mobile homes; 
d.  Extraction of sand, gravel, and other materials; 
e.  Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines, and pipelines; 
f.  Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves; 
g.  Storage yards for non-floatable and readily transportable equipment or machinery; 
h.  Other uses which the board of review considers to be similar in nature to those listed elsewhere in this section; and 
i.  A single family dwelling or a manufactured home may be constructed on a lot that was on record in the office of the clerk of the Superior Court of Dougherty County, Georgia on the effective date of the first adoption of this ordinance if the lowest floor of that dwelling is at least one foot above the 100 year flood elevation. The method used to raise the structure must not increase the regulatory flood elevation, or obstruct the carrying capacity of the floodway in accordance with article 6, section B(2)(a). 
5.  Signs to identify floodway. Wherever the floodway boundary crosses a public road, a sign shall be placed by the City of Albany identifying property located on the river side of the sign as lying within the floodway. 
Section C. - Floodway fringe. 
1.  Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply to all areas designated as the floodway fringe on the official flood maps. 
2.  Subdivision development in the floodway fringe. The plat of each subdivision that is developed in the floodway fringe after the effective date when this ordinance was first adopted shall contain a notation clearly stating the water surface elevation of the 100-year flood in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
Section D. - Other floodplain areas. 
    Standards for streams without established base flood elevation and/or floodways: 
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in article 3, section B, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where base flood has been provided without floodways, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
2.  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with article 4, section C(1). 
(a)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
3.  Where base flood data has been provided but without floodways delineated, new construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall have lowest floor elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation. 
    Areas of non-stream related flooding: 
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in article 3, section B, are isolated areas designated as unnumbered A-zones on the FIRM maps. These areas may have special flood hazards where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where localized ponding occurs; therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated, at least one foot above the base flood elevation established by the city engineer. 
2.  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential buildings shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation established by the city engineer. 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely flood-proofed to our above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
ARTICLE 7. - FLOOD-PROOFING 

Section A. - Minimum flood-proofing requirements. 
    Wherever any of the provisions of this ordinance require that a building be flood-proofed or specify that flood-proofing may be used as an alternative to elevating a structure above the regulatory flood level, flood-proofing shall be deemed to include all of the following: 
1.  Wherever possible, the location, construction, and installation of all electrical and gas utility systems in such a manner as to ensure the continuing functioning of those systems in event of a regulatory flood; 
2.  The location, construction, and installation of all portable water supply systems in such a manner as to prevent contamination from floodwaters during the regulatory flood. No water supply well shall be located within the foundation walls of a building or structure used for human habitation, medical or educational services, food processing, or public services. 
3.  Approved backflow preventers or devices shall be installed on main water service lines at water wells and at all building entry locations to protect the system from backflow or back siphonage of floodwaters or other contaminants. 
4.  Sanitary sewer and storm drainage systems that have openings below the regulatory flood elevation shall be equipped with automatic backwater valves or other automatic backflow devices that are installed in each discharge line passing through a building exterior wall. 
5.  Sanitary sewer systems, including septic tank systems, that are required to remain in operation during a flood, shall be provided with a sealed holding tank and the necessary isolation and diversion piping, pumps, ejectors, and appurtenances required to prevent sewage discharge during a flood. The holding tank shall be sized for storage of at least two days' demand. 
6.  All sewer system vents shall extend to an elevation of at least three feet above the regulatory flood elevation. 
7.  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that any new construction or substantial improvement has been designed to withstand the flood depths, pressure, velocities, impact and uplift forces associated with the regulatory flood at the location of the building. 
The certificate shall state that specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure has been flood-proofed. The certificate shall be kept for public inspection in the office of planning and development services. 
Section B. - Approval of flood-proofing. 
    Prior to construction, plans for any structure that is required to be flood-proofed must be submitted to the building inspection department. These plans will be forwarded to the city engineer for review and approval. The city engineer shall review the plans for compliance techniques specified in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers publication entitled "Flood-proofing Regulations," June 1972, GPO: 19730-505-026 and for compliance with any other applicable building codes or regulations. The city engineer shall approve, reject, or recommend modifications of the plans within 15 days from the receipt of the plans. 
ARTICLE 8. - NON-CONFORMING USES

Example: A department store (Retail) would fall into the profitability class #2 on the NAICS Profitability List, so they would select the tax rate of .000475 from the Occupation Tax Schedule. The calculation would be: 
Gross receipts of $1,500,000 X .000475 = $ 712.50 Amount Due. 
    Definition of Gross receipts: Gross receipts means total revenue of the business or practitioner for the period, including without being limited to, the following: 
(i)  Total income without deduction for the cost of goods sold or expenses incurred; 
(ii)  Gain from trading in stocks, bonds, capital assets, or instruments of indebtedness; 
(iii)  Proceeds from commissions on the sale of property, goods, or services; 
(iv)  Proceeds from fees charged for services rendered; and 
(v)  Proceeds from rent, interest, royalty, or dividend income. 
Gross receipts shall not include the following: 
(i)  Sales, use, or excise taxes; 
(ii)  Sales returns, allowances, and discounts; 
(iii)  Interorganizational sales or transfers between or among the units of a parent subsidiary controlled group of corporations. 
Occupation tax schedule: Profitability class Rate per $ 1,000.00 Tax Rate (percent) 1 .29 .000290 2 .475 .000475 3 .55 .000550 4 .55 .000550 5 .65 .000650 6 .85 .000850  
The profitability class rate for each business is increased by 20%. Each year beginning 2014 this amount shall increase by the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the preceding year. The CPI is the Consumer Price Index published by the United States Department of Labor - Bureau of Labor Statistics All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). 
The due date for occupation taxes is January 31 of each year.

ARTICLE 1: DEFINITIONS AND INTENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS
This article defines the purpose and intent of the zoning districts established by this ordinance. The intent
of all districts is to promote the most desirable use of land in accordance with the Comprehensive
Development Plan. Arterial, local and other streets referenced in this section are defined by the local
Transportation Plan. Uses referenced in this section are examples only; specific uses allowed in each
district are defined in Title II, Article 2 Table of Permitted Uses.
 R-E, ESTATE DISTRICT.
The Estate District is a residential/agricultural district. In the City, use of land is primarily for single-family
residences and related recreation, religious and educational facilities normally desired in an orderly and
attractive residential area; while in the County agricultural uses are also permitted within the district. The RE
District is intended to be protected from encroachment by uses that are incompatible with the function,
character, quality or livability of the district. Internal stability, safety, attractiveness, order and efficiency in
the use of land are encouraged by providing for adequate light, air and open space for residences and related
facilities and through consideration for the proper functional relations of the different land uses internal to
and proximate to the R-E District.
 R-G, R-1, R-2, SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS. (R-G allowed in County only).
Single-Family Residential Districts are established as districts in which the principal use of land is for singlefamily
dwellings. The specific intent of the R-G, R-1 and R-2 Districts is to (a) Encourage the construction
of, and the continued use of the land for, single-family dwellings; b) Prohibit business, commercial, industrial
and any other use that would substantially interfere with development or maintenance of single-family
dwellings in the district; (c) Encourage the discontinuance of existing uses that would not be permitted as new
uses under the provisions of these regulations; (d) Discourage any land use that would generate traffic on
minor or local streets, other than normal traffic to serve the residences on those streets; and (e) Discourage
any use which, because of its character or size, would create requirements and costs for public services, such
as fire and police protection, water supply and sewerage, substantially in excess of such requirements and
costs if the district were developed solely for single-family dwellings.
 R-3, SINGLE-FAMILY AND TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.
The Single-Family and Two-Family Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use
of land is for single-family and two-family dwellings based upon a plan to make the most appropriate use of
land. Two-family buildings are intended to have the appearance of single-family homes and be compatible
with the scale and character of surrounding single-family homes and neighborhoods. The specific intent of
this district is to insure that only such residential uses are permitted as can be properly designed and built so
as not to overcrowd the land, cause parking or traffic congestion, or have injurious effects on adjacent singlefamily
residential property.
 R-MHS, MOBILE HOME SINGLE-FAMILY DISTRICT.
The Mobile Home Single-Family District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is
for single-family mobile homes. In promoting the general purpose of these regulations, the specific intent
of this district is to: (a) Provide adequate space and facilities for healthful living conditions of occupants of
such mobile homes; (b) Discourage any land use that would generate traffic on minor or local streets, other
than normal traffic to serve the residences on those streets; (c) Insure suitable water and sewer facilities
would be provided in accordance with health regulations and statutes of the State of Georgia and the
8/8/2013 II - 4
governing body; and (d) Encourage the development of mobile home districts for long-term residential use
by encouraging the placement of mobile homes on individually owned lots in homogeneous environments and
by clustering these lots into subdivisions to facilitate the provision of public services.
This district is further intended to discourage the scattering of mobile homes in rural territories, and
piecemeal, ribbon development along City, county and other public roads. It also discourages the subdivision
of rural land into small tracts and tracts visible from a road, which might have adverse effects on existing land
uses or later encumber future large-scale development by blocking road frontages, creating small pockets of
contrasting land uses, impairing scenic views or being incompatible with the character of rural scenic roads
and highways.
 R-MHP, MOBILE HOME PARK DISTRICT.
The Mobile Home Park District is intended only for areas suitable for mobile home or trailer coach parks.
The intent of this district is to: (a) Require adequate space and facilities for healthful living conditions for
occupants of mobile home trailer and coaches; (b) Require that all MHP Districts have direct access to a
major thoroughfare so that proper accessibility, traffic control, and protection of adjacent streets from
related traffic is ensured; (c) Require that water and sewer facilities are provided according to health
regulations and statutes of the State of Georgia and the City/County Commission; and (d) Require that
mobile home and trailer coach parks are sufficiently separated from and have no adverse effects on
residential and mixed-use districts
 C-R, COMMUNITY RESIDENTIAL MULTIPLE-DWELLING DISTRICT.
The Community Residential Multiple-Dwelling District is a pedestrian-oriented district, intended to permit
residential use of land with various types of multiple dwellings and related uses, including townhouses,
duplexes and apartment buildings; and at the intersection of an arterial and collector street, to permit limited
sidewalk-oriented commercial uses of a type and size that will primarily serve walking patrons from nearby
residences. Pedestrian access from adjacent areas and within the district is promoted through generous, safe,
convenient and shaded pedestrian sidewalks along all streets, and primary entrances to dwelling units are
primarily oriented to streets, rather than parking lots. It is intended that this district be located near major
streets for good accessibility and traffic control, designed to complement adjacent single-family areas, built to
meet the needs of the different age and family groups in the community by providing various types and sizes
of residential accommodations for ownership and rental, and properly planned with adequate facilities and
services so as not to not overtax existing community facilities, utilities or services.
It is also the intent of this district to provide sufficient size areas for multiple dwelling developments and to
allow reasonable flexibility in design and orientation for a multifamily structure or group of structures on a
given site. The maximum height and floor area requirements may be increased where such increases are
determined by administrative variation of the Director of Planning and Development Services to have no
adverse traffic, visual or other impacts on adjacent or nearby single-family or two-family residential districts.
All Multiple-Dwelling District developments shall include common open space and recreation areas that are
visible from development streets. The use of a gridded development pattern with multiple outlets to arterial
and collector streets is encouraged to further enhance safe and efficient pedestrian and vehicular access.
8/8/2013 II - 5
C-1, NEIGHBORHOOD MIXED-USE BUSINESS DISTRICT.
The Neighborhood Mixed-Use Business District is a pedestrian-oriented commercial district intended to
provide, adjacent to residential areas, a mix of retail, restaurant, service and office uses that primarily serve
nearby residents and that do not generate large traffic volumes or parking problems. Pedestrian access from
adjacent areas and within the district is promoted through safe, convenient and tree-shaded pedestrian
sidewalks along all streets. Buildings have primary pedestrian entrances adjacent to a public sidewalk, and
off-street parking is located to the side or rear of buildings. Vehicular access, parking and service areas are
arranged to promote a safe, smooth traffic flow and minimize pedestrian and vehicular conflicts.
The intent of this district is also to avoid the continuance of scattered and marginal retail, services and office
commercial strips along major streets by clustering the smaller businesses in distinct areas near
neighborhoods, where such businesses serve local residents, are mutually supportive to the advantage of both
businesses and customers, and where on-street parking and shared parking areas may be promoted.
The C-1(N) District is identical to the C-1 District except no use with on-premise consumption of alcohol is
allowed. No new C-1(N) Districts will be created.
 C-2, GENERAL MIXED-USE BUSINESS DISTRICT.
The General Business District is intended to provide a mixed-use district with a wider range of uses and
greater height of buildings than permitted in the C-1, Neighborhood Business District, and to provide a
compact, compatible and complementary mixture of residential, restaurant, retail, office, commercial,
cultural, institutional and governmental uses that serve both nearby and regional residents. The volume of
traffic and associated service areas and parking needs associated with such uses can be more efficiently
addressed through a compact development pattern and shared access, parking and service areas. Pedestrian
access from adjacent areas and within the district is promoted through generous, safe, convenient and treeshaded
pedestrian sidewalks along all streets. Vehicular access, parking and service areas are arranged to
promote a safe, smooth traffic flow and minimize pedestrian and vehicular conflicts.
The intent of this district is also to avoid increasing unsustainable expansion of strip commercial
developments along major arterials, by providing locations for the concentration of a mix of local and
regional businesses and civic and institutional uses in locations and arrangements that are mutually supportive
and more economically sustainable over time.
The C-2(N) District is identical to the C-2 District except no use with on-premise consumption of alcohol is
allowed. No new C-2(N) Districts will be created.
 C-3, COMMERCIAL DISTRICT.
Commercial Districts are intended to permit, along major arterials, businesses that will attract regional
customers and thereby need greater automobile accessibility; and which generally have one or more of the
following characteristics: (a) Goods offered for sale are infrequently purchased by individual consumers;
(b) Businesses are a size or type that typically need much larger service, loading and parking areas than are
found in other commercial districts; (c) Businesses typically need larger buildings located on larger parcels
than are found in other districts; (d) Goods offered for sale are typically purchased at drive-through
window facilities; (e) Businesses are small, light manufacturing and processing establishments that have no
adverse effects upon other uses in the district and are compatible with the character of the district. Usual
requirements for trees in parking areas and for screening of parking areas are not required for vehicular
display areas. Mixed-use developments are encouraged.
8/8/2013 II - 6
The intent of this district is also to improve vehicular access and safety and reduce congestion and vehicular
conflicts by providing direct arterial road access, shared parking areas, shared driveways and intra-parcel
vehicular access that connects all individual business and parking areas. Pedestrian access from adjacent
commercial and residential areas and between individual businesses is promoted through safe, convenient and
tree-shaded pedestrian sidewalks along streets and building frontages.
 C-5, OFFICE-INSTITUTIONAL-RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.
The Office-Institutional-Residential District is a pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use district that is intended to
permit, close to residential areas, office, institutional, residential and certain restricted business uses that
provide local employment opportunities, thus reducing travel distance to and from work. Pedestrian access
from adjacent areas and within the district is promoted through generous, safe, convenient and tree-shaded
pedestrian sidewalks along all streets, and off-street parking is located to the side or rear of buildings.
Buildings have primary pedestrian entrances that are located on a public sidewalk and face the street.
Vehicular access, parking and service areas are arranged to promote a safe, smooth traffic flow and minimize
pedestrian and vehicular conflicts. The C-5 District is also intended to provide opportunities for the clustering
of office buildings that are compatible with adjacent residential areas; provide landscaping, sidewalks and
multi-use trails for the convenience of workers and residents; and provide small, limited-use retail and
services that serve the local office and residential uses and do not generate large volumes of traffic, traffic
congestion and parking problems within adjacent neighborhoods.
 C-6, TRANSITIONAL BUSINESS DISTRICT.
The Transitional Business District provides an opportunity for older, declining residential parcels that are
located along primarily commercial corridors to transition to a residential/office mixed-use district.
Compatibility with residential uses and historic residential lot patterns is protected by maintaining certain
residential lot characteristics such as landscaped front yards with traditional residential set-backs.
Pedestrian access from adjacent areas and within the district is promoted through generous, safe,
convenient and tree-shaded pedestrian sidewalks along all streets.
Office and related support services that are compatible with residential uses are encouraged. Business are
prohibited that may potentially have adverse impacts on the quality of residential uses in the district and
adjacent districts. Rear-yard inter-parcel access between businesses, through alleys and through shared
private drives between businesses, is encouraged to promote a safe, smooth traffic flow, minimize conflicts
with pedestrians, and reduce turning movements.
 C-7, MIXED-USE PLANNED-DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
The Mixed-Use Planned-Development District is established to provide for large developments that include a
compact, compatible and complementary mixture of residential, office, commercial, cultural, institutional and
governmental uses in a walkable, pedestrian-friendly environment. Pedestrian access from adjacent areas and
within the district is promoted through generous, safe, convenient and tree-shaded pedestrian sidewalks along
all streets. Buildings have primary pedestrian entrances on public sidewalks facing the street. Off-street
parking is located to the side or rear of buildings. Vehicular access, parking and service areas are arranged to
promote a safe, smooth traffic flow and minimize pedestrian and vehicular conflicts.
The purpose of this district is (1) To encourage flexible, creative and sustainable approaches to a range of
development opportunities within a pedestrian-oriented mixed-use district; (2) To provide effective solutions
to transportation and parking problems, including private, public, motorized bicycle and pedestrian; (3) To
promote citizen interaction and a sense of community; (4) To provide economic, convenient and efficient
provision of sufficient public services; (5) To preserve significant natural features of the land; and (6) To
8/8/2013 II - 7
develop in a manner compatible with other land in the vicinity.
 C-8, COMMERCIAL RECREATION DISTRICT.
The Commercial Recreation District is intended to provide areas for the development of parks and
recreational facilities that will be privately operated. Publicly-owned parks and recreation facilities, however,
are not specifically excluded from this zoning district. The C-8 District is designed primarily for recreational
uses of an outdoor nature. Multi-use recreational paths that are located throughout the district, and that
provide connections to adjacent residential areas and mixed-use areas, are encouraged.
 M-1, RESTRICTED INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.
The Restricted Industrial District is intended only for those specific businesses that contain on-site any of the
adverse effects of manufacturing, including noise, dust, smoke, vibrations and odors, and any other adverse
effects, and which assemble or fabricate manufactured products that are ready for retail sale. Processing of
certain types of agricultural products is allowed in the district provided that all other requirements are met.
Firms that utilize substantial quantities of water in manufacturing are not permitted in the district. Industrial
uses permitted in the M-1 zoning district do not necessarily require rail frontage.
In addition to the assembling and fabricating functions mentioned above, commercial establishments that
provide business services oriented specifically to local industrial establishments or to their employees are also
allowed. Certain commercial uses having an open storage or open operations characteristic, though not
necessarily industrial in character, are also allowed in the M-1 District.
 M-2, HEAVY INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.
The Heavy Industrial District is especially designed for the following types of industries: (a) firms that
process raw materials, such as minerals, forest products, chemicals and unfinished metal, into
manufactured products ready for retail sale, (b)firms that process raw materials into products that will be
used in the production of other manufactured products, (c) firms that produce or store toxic substances for
direct sale or for distribution to retailers or other manufacturers, (d) firms that use substantial quantities of
water in manufacturing processes, and (e) firms engaged in the slaughtering of animals.
Access to the M-2 district is intended to be located directly on major arterial streets. The adverse effects of
manufacturing, including noise, dust, smoke, vibrations and odors, and any other adverse effects, are required
to be contained within the district. Adequate truck access, adequate buffer, and other measures must be
provided as needed such that the M-2 District truck access does not adversely impact adjacent or nearby
residential and business districts.
 FH, FLOOD HAZARD DISTRICT.
It is the intent of the Flood Hazard District to prohibit intensive commercial, residential, industrial, and
institutional use of lands lying within the floodway of the Flint River, Muckafoonee Creek, and the Georgia
Power Company Reservoir in order to reduce costs to the general public for flood control and disaster relief.
The Flood Hazard District includes lands that are part of the floodplain of the Flint River, Kinchafoonee,
Muckafoonee Creek, Muckalee Creek, the Georgia Power Company Reservoir, Piney Woods Creek, and Dry
Creek.
The FH zone area depicted on the zoning map was established prior to mapping of the floodplains for flood
insurance purposes, and is intended only as estimates given to identify areas subject to flooding. In all
situations, the requirements of the Floodplain Management Ordinance of the City of Albany and Dougherty
8/8/2013 II - 8
County will take precedence when there are conflicts between those ordinances and the zoning ordinance.
 AG, AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT.
The Agricultural District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for farming,
dairying, forestry operations and other agricultural activities. To promote the general purpose of these
regulations, the specific intent of the Agricultural District is to (a) protect land needed and used for
agricultural pursuits from encroachment by untimely and unplanned residential, commercial or industrial
development, and (b) allow the continuation of existing agricultural pursuits in areas where, in accordance
with the recommendations of the Comprehensive Development Plan, future residential, commercial or
industrial development is anticipated but where the present application of zoning controls for future more
intensive land uses would be unreasonable and premature.
8/8/2013 II - 9

ARTICLE 3: SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS IN C-R, C-1, C-5, C-6 AND C-7 DISTRICTS
This article provides sidewalk and site requirements for C-R, C-1, C-5, C-6 and C-7 districts, also referred
to, as a group, as the Traditional Mixed Use Districts. These requirements are in addition to the General
Requirements for all Districts and shall take precedent over any conflicting code requirements.
The purpose of these requirements is to a) provide safe, attractive and convenient pedestrian-oriented
environment, b) support a sustainable mix of uses that can respond to market changes and c) foster
superior quality of life where residents can live, work and recreate.
Graphic illustrations of some of the requirements in this article are found in Title I. Article 6: Illustrations
of Definitions. Unless otherwise indicated, each illustration is intended to specifically illustrate only the
indicated requirement; all other suggestions of design, such as architectural style, streetscape, and
aesthetics, do not constitute a requirement of this section. Words in SMALL CAPS are words that are defined
in Title I, Definitions.
Section 3.01 SUPPLEMENTAL FRONT YARDS IN C-R, C-1, C-5, C-6, AND C-7 DISTRICTS
SUPPLEMENTAL FRONT YARD requirements replace Front Yard, and Side Yard setback requirements
adjacent to the street in C-R, C-1, C-5, C-6 and C-7 Districts. (See Title I Definitions, Sidewalk Area.)
Supplemental Front Yards have a maximum setback from the sidewalk clear zone. (See Title II Section 2
Table of Minimum Lot Area and Yard Requirements.). The following requirements shall apply to
SUPPLEMENTAL FRONT YARDS.
1. Terraces, porches and stoops, not including stairs, shall encroach a maximum depth of sixty (60)
percent of the total SUPPLEMENTAL FRONT YARD depth. Terraces, porches and stoops that are not
a required accessible route into and through the dwelling unit, as established by Sec. 804. [42
U.S.C. 3604] (3) (C) (iii) (I) of the Fair Housing Act shall have a minimum finished floor height of
twenty-four (24) inches above the grade of the SIDEWALK AREA. Such terraces, porches, and stoops

less than a ten (10) per cent variance in requirements, or when saving a healthy tree with a twelve
(12) inch or greater caliper at four (4) feet above grade, or when reducing parking requirements,
except that parking spaces shall not be reduced to zero (0).
4. Expansion of the footprint of non-conforming uses: Approval of an increase in the size of
nonconforming uses, up to ten (10) percent additional area, may be sought through an administrative
review, by the Director of Planning and Development Services, provided that only one (1) such
approval shall be permitted for the lifetime of such use, and provided that all other site requirements,
including parking, landscaping, screening and sidewalk requirements, are met.

ARTICLE 7: FLOOD HAZARD DISTRICT
Those areas shown as FH on the zoning map shall be regulated in the following manner, in addition to
complying with the Floodplain Management Regulations of the City of Albany or Dougherty County, are:
1. Where the property is bounded on all sides, excluding one street frontage by one other zoning
district, uses are as permitted by that abutting district.
2. Where the property is abutted by more than one other zoning district, uses may be as permitted in
the less intensive abutting zoning district and more restrictive, that is, the district first listed in the
following list of zoning districts, Title II, Article 1 Definition and Intent of Zoning Districts.
3. Where the property is abutted by other FH zoning, uses may be as permitted in the least intensive
adjacent district within five hundred (500) feet, or as permitted in the R-1 District.
4. Where the property is abutted by an M-1, or M-2 District, any use other than continued nonconforming
uses or agricultural shall require the Special Approval of the City/County
Commission.
ARTICLE 8: FLINT RIVER AND KINCHAFOONEE CREEK CORRIDOR PROTECTION CRITERIA
1. Purpose and Applicability
In 1991, the General Assembly passed the Mountain and River Corridor Protection Act, which
called for the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to develop criteria for the protection of
important river corridors within the State of Georgia. These criteria apply to all perennial rivers or
streams with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second (as defined by the United
States Geologic Survey). In December 1991, the Board of Natural Resources adopted these river
corridor protection criteria. A subsequent amendment of the Minimum Planning Standards and
Procedures for Local Comprehensive Planning (approved by the Board of Community Affairs in
April 1992), requires all local governments to address these River Corridor Protection criteria
within their comprehensive plans as they apply to rivers and streams in their municipal boundaries.
Within Dougherty County, the Flint River and Kinchafoonee Creek are subject to the River
Corridor Protection criteria. Kinchafoonee Creek joins the Flint River just south of Lake Chehaw.
From this point, the Flint River flows southward through the eastern part of Dougherty County,
effectively dividing Dougherty County into two parts, and also dividing the City of Albany.
The primary purposes of the River Corridor Protection criteria are to protect water quality, reduce
erosion, encourage the protection of wildlife habitats, and reduce the risk of flood damage to
properties near major rivers. Therefore, the protection criteria require the establishment and
maintenance of a 100-foot natural vegetative buffer, containing flora and fauna native to the area.
The 100-foot wide buffer, consisting of the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the
rivers low water line shall be treated by local governments in the same manner as the river
corridor and shall be included within the River Corridor Protection Plan.
Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, riverbank erosion,
and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these criteria,
the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review
period of local comprehensive plans. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the start
8/8/2013 II - 30
of the review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the
next review by the Department of Community Affairs.
2. Permissible Uses
a. Land use existing prior to the promulgation of a River Corridor Protection Plan
b. Single family dwellings, including the usual appurtenances, are permitted within the
buffer area, subject to the following conditions:
i. The dwelling shall be in compliance with all local zoning regulations.
ii. No more than one (1) dwelling shall be located on a tract of land containing at
least two acres, not including any area that lies within the river corridor.
iii. A septic tank serving such a dwelling may be located within the buffer area.
iv. Septic tank drainfields shall not be located within the buffer area.
v. Construction of road crossings and utility crossings provided that construction of
such road and utility crossings shall meet all requirements of the Erosion and
Sedimentation Control Act of 1975, and of any applicable local ordinances on
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control.
c. Timber production and harvesting are subject to the following conditions:
i. Forestry activity shall be consistent with best management practices established by
the Georgia Forestry Commission; and
ii. Forestry activity shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined
by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended.
d. Wildlife and fisheries management activities.
e. Recreational usage consistent either with the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or
with river dependent recreation. For example, a boat ramp would be consistent with this
criterion, but a hard-surface tennis court would not. Parking lots are not consistent with
this criterion. Paths and walkways within the river corridor are consistent with this
criterion.
f. Natural water quality treatment or purification.
g. Agricultural production and management, subject to the following conditions:
i. Agricultural activity shall be consistent with the Best Management practices
established by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission;
ii. Agricultural activity shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water as
defined by the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended; and
iii. Agricultural activity shall be consistent with all state and federal laws, and all
regulations promulgated by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
h. Mining activities, if permitted by the Department of Natural Resources pursuant to the
Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968, as amended.
i. Utilities, if such utilities cannot feasibly be located outside the buffer area, and provided
that:
i. :The utilities shall be located as far from the river bank as reasonably possible;
ii. Installation and maintenance of the utilities shall be such as to protect the integrity
of the buffer area as well as is reasonably possible; and
iii. Utilities shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water.
8/8/2013 II - 31
j. Other uses permitted by the Department of Natural Resources or under Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act.
For all of the above uses, the natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible
following any land disturbing activity within the river corridor. These uses are permissible upon
compliance with all local, state, and federal laws currently in effect.
3. Prohibited Uses
The following uses are prohibited.
a. Except as provided in connection with permitted single family dwellings, septic tanks,
and septic tank drainfields are prohibited.
b. Handling areas for the receiving and storage of hazardous waste are prohibited. Port
facilities are exempt from this criterion provided that:
i. Port facilities shall meet all federal and state laws and regulations for the handling
and transport of hazardous waste, and
ii. Port facilities handling hazardous waste shall perform their operations on
impermeable surfaces having spill and leak protection systems as prescribed by
the Department of Natural Resources
c. Hazardous Waste or Solid Waste Landfills are prohibited.
d. Other uses unapproved by the City/County shall not be acceptable within the river
corridors.
____________________________________________________________________________
1 River bank shall mean the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the
natural channel during the normal course of flow.
2 River corridor shall mean all land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River
Protection Act (O>C.G.A. 12-5-440 through 12-5-457), or the Coastal Marshland Protection Act
(O.C.G.A. 12-5-280 through 12-5-293), in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally
on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks.
ARTICLE 9: WETLAND AND STREAM CORRIDOR PROTECTION CRITERIA (Dougherty
County only)
A. Purpose and Applicability
The quality of urban and rural streams reflects the quality of land management and land development
activities within the watershed. Reducing the amount of disturbance and impervious surfaces adjacent
to watercourses is one of the best methods to reduce the quantity of non-point source pollutants in
these watercourses and wetlands; this is done by allowing stormwater pollutants to infiltrate the soil
before they reach the water resource. Conventional zoning ordinances generally do not mitigate these
problems to a sufficient degree, and therefore, are not considerate enough of the impacts on
environmental resources, and, in turn, the quality of life and health of the communitys residents.
Zoning of the built environment generally requires setbacks for buildings and rights of way for streets
8/8/2013 II - 32
and roads. However, wetlands and streams do not enjoy the same protection. These resources not only
serve natural systems, but directly affect the quality of life of the human environment by providing
clean water, a critical element of human health, economy, and general well-being.
These streams and wetlands do not exist apart from their surrounding upland areas. They are
intertwined in a dynamic link to create balance in a natural system. Therefore, as part of an overall
watershed protection strategy, it is not enough to protect the wet areas of wetlands and streams.
Protection must also be extended to the contiguous upland areas of those hydric systems as well.
Protection should be provided all natural streams and wetlands in Dougherty County. Streams to be
buffered will be identified as the first solid blue line on a 7.5 minute, U.S.G.S. Quadrangle map.
Freshets and intermittent streams will not be included in the ordinance. All jurisdictional wetlands will
be buffered, and will be identified by at least one of the following:
1. The Central Dougherty Plain Advance Identification of Wetlands (U.S. EPA) Draft Technical
Summary Document;
2. Those wetlands identified by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers documents, or by private contractor,
certified in wetland delineation by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers:
3. The National Wetlands Inventory published by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.
B. Buffers and Permitted Uses
A lateral, three-tier system will establish buffer width, and will permit increasing levels of activities
within the entire stream or wetland buffer zone. These zones are outlined as follows:
1. The Streamside Zone protects the physical and ecological integrity of the stream ecosystem. The
vegetative target is mature riparian forest that can provide shade, leaf liner, woody debris and
erosion protection to the stream. The width is 25 feet (100 feet on rivers with a mean annual flow
of 400 cfs or more, per the requirements of the Mountain and River Corridor Protection Act,
199]), measured from each stream bank (bank being defined as that adjacent, uppermost part of
the land adjacent to the watercourse that serves to contain it). This distance equals about one or
two mature trees growth from the streambank.
Land use in this zone will be highly restricted, limited to stormwater channels, footpaths, and a few
utility or roadway crossings. In this zone, those areas previously developed or improved will be
hereafter undisturbed; vegetation in this zone will be left to develop, eventually creating a mature
forest typical of this region and soil conditions.
2. The Middle Zone extends from the outward boundary of the streamside zone, and is also 25 feet
wide. Its key functions are to protect key components of the stream and provide further distance
between upland development and the stream. The vegetative target for this zone is also mature
forest, but some clearing may be allowed for stormwater management, access, and recreational
uses.
A wider range of activities and uses are allowed within this zone, e.g., recreation, bike paths, and
8/8/2013 II - 33
stormwater BMPs.
3. The Outer Zone can practically be considered the buffers buffer, and is an additional 25-foot
setback from the outer edge of the middle zone to the nearest permanent structure. In most
instances, this will be a residential backyard. The vegetative target for the outer zone is usually turf
or lawn. However, the property owner is encouraged to plant trees and shrubs in this area, thereby
increasing the total width of the buffer.
Very few uses are restricted in this zone. Gardening, lawns, etc are promoted in this zone, but septic
systems and permanent structures are prohibited.
In the event that a landowner disputes a determination by the permitting agency concerning buffer width
and/or identification of the stream bank, the property owner has the option of retaining a wetland
scientist and/or a certified land surveyor to delineate the buffer widths and distances.
C. Hardships
Property owners may make use of three mitigation options if they feel they have been unduly
impacted by the provisions above. They are as follows:
1. Buffer Averaging - This approach allows some flexibility in the width of the buffer, as long as
the streamside zone is not impacted. Where the width of the buffer must be compromised on one
part of the property, the width will be made up in another part, that is, the buffer will be wider at
the mitigation point, and narrower at the variance point.
2. Density Compensation - This method grants a developer a credit for additional density elsewhere
on the site, in compensation for developable land that has been lost due to the buffer
requirement. Developable land is defined as the portion of buffer area remaining after the
wetland, streamside, or steep slope areas has been subtracted. Credits will be granted when more
than 5% of developable land is consumed. The density credit is accommodated at the
development site by allowing greater flexibility in setbacks, frontage distances, or minimum lot
sizes to squeeze in lost lots. Cluster development provisions would also allow the developer to
recover lots that are taken out of production due to buffers and other requirements.
3. Conservation Easements- Landowners should be afforded the option of protecting lands within
the buffer by means of a perpetual conservation easement. The easement conditions the use of
the buffer, and can be donated to a land trust as a charitable contribution that can reduce an
owners tax burden. Alternatively, the conservation easement can be donated to the County, in
exchange for a reduction or elimination of property tax on the parcel. In order for this provision
to become a bona fide option, the County or some other appropriate agency or body must
organize a land trust.
D. Appeals
Property owners may request a variance from these provisions through the process outlined in Title III,
Article 5, Section 5.00 of the Zoning Ordinance. Applicants must demonstrate severe economic
hardship, or unique circumstances making it impossible to meet some or all of the buffer requirements.

ARTICLE 1: SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS
The regulations set forth in this article supplement or modify the district regulations appearing elsewhere
in this ordinance.
Section 1.01 LOTS OF RECORD.
Any lot in a zoning district permitting construction of single-family dwellings, which was on record in
the Office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Dougherty County on March 24, 1970, and which does
not meet the minimum requirements of this Ordinance for lot area and/or lot width, may be utilized for
single-family residential purposes under the following conditions:
A. The area of the lot shall be at least seventy-five (75) percent of that required by this Ordinance.
B. The width of the lot as measured at the building setback line shall be at least seventy-five (75)
percent of that required by this Ordinance.
C. The building shall be placed on the lot in such a way that the required front yard, rear yard and
interior side yards can be provided. In the case of a substandard corner lot, the building may
extend into the required side yard adjacent to the street; provided that the building shall have a
minimum set back equal to the lesser of fourteen (14) feet from the property line along said
street, or the minimum requirement of the district.
The purpose of this provision is to permit utilization of recorded lots, which lack adequate width and/or
lot area, so long as reasonable living standards can be provided.
In the event the three (3) requirements listed above cannot be met, a single-family dwelling may be
constructed on the lot only with approval of the Director of Planning and Development Services,
including conditions that may be placed on said approval.
The more liberal terms of this Section shall not apply in the R-3 district when the same person owns
adjacent lots having more than 120 feet of frontage along the same street. In such cases, the substandard
lots shall be re-divided for the purpose of creating standard lots. A plat showing redivision of the lots
shall be recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Dougherty County before a building
permit for said lots is issued. In similar fashion, the terms of this Section shall also not apply where the
same person owns adjacent lots having more than 130 feet of frontage in the R-1 zoning district, and
more than 160 feet of frontage in the R-2 zoning district.
Within a designated urban redevelopment area within the city limits of the City of Albany, the provisions
in A, B, or C above shall apply where lots are being recombined to create a lesser number of lots. For
instance, if four lots are purchased, and three new lots are created, each of those lots shall meet the
requirements of A, B, or C, even though they were not pre-existing lots of record.
Section 1.02 CONSTRUCTION PRIOR TO ADOPTION.
Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to require any change in the plans, construction or designed
2/2/2009 III - 6
use of any building upon which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the adoption of these
regulations, and upon which building actual construction has been diligently carried on, and provided
further, that such building shall be completed within one (1) year from the date of passage of these
regulations.
Section 1.03 FRONTAGE.
A. Every detached single-family residence in the AG, R-E, R-G, R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-MHS, districts
shall be located on a lot that fronts on a public street or on a legally established private street.
B. In the R-3 district, a two-family residence (duplex) is permitted to be constructed on a single
approved and recorded lot only if that lot fronts on a public street or on a legally established
private street.
C. In the C-R, C-1, C-5, C-6, and C-7 districts, every detached single-family residence and every
two-family resident (duplex) shall be located either on a lot that fronts a street, whether public or
private; or when part of a group of single-family residences or two-family residences, are
permitted to be constructed in such a way that such group fronts on a private drive, private road
or private court only if that group of one or two-family residences is part of an approved larger
development containing two or more groups of single-family or two-family (duplex) residences,
all of which are located on a single lot or single tract of land or on a subdivided lot fronting on a
legally established private street, and subject to conditions placed on such approval by the
Director of Planning and Development Services.
D. In the C-R and C-6 District, one multiple dwelling is permitted to be constructed on a single
approved and recorded lot only if that lot fronts on a public street, or on a legally established
private street.
E. In the C-R District, a group of multiple dwellings is permitted to be constructed in such a way
that it fronts on a private drive, private road or private court if such group of multiple dwellings
is part of a larger development containing two or more groups of multiple dwellings, all of which
are located on a single lot or single tract of land that is fronting on a public street or a legally
established private street, and subject to conditions placed on such approval by the Director of
Planning and Development Services.
F. In C districts, and M districts, every principal building shall have clear and immediate access to a
public street or to a legally established private street.
G. Where a front yard of lesser depth than specified in the Schedule of Regulations exists in front of
dwellings on more than sixty (60) percent of lots of record on one (1) side of the street in any one
(1) block in a R-1, R-2 or R-3 District, the depth of the front yard for any building hereafter
erected or replaced on any lot in such block need not be greater than the average depth of front
yards of such existing buildings.
2/2/2009 III - 7
Section 1.04 SETBACKS AFTER CONDEMNATION.
Whenever any improvements on a parcel of land becomes deficient or nonconforming with respect to the
required front or side line setback requirements of this ordinance as the result of the acquisition of a
portion of the property by a governmental body through the exercise of or the threat of the exercise of its
powers of eminent domain, the required setback for such improvement shall, by operation of law and
without any further action, become the distance between the improvement and the new property line
established by such acquisition.
Section 1.05 SCREENING OUTDOOR STORAGE.
In all districts, scrap piles, junk piles, automobile salvage yards and wrecked vehicle compounds that are
within 200 feet of a public street, R-District, C-R, C-1, C-5, C-6, C-7, or C-8 District or residential use
shall be obscured from view from that public street, district, or residential use.
Commercial and industrial uses that require the open storage of building materials, sand, gravel, stone
and lumber that are either adjacent to or across an alley from any R-Districts or C-R, C-1, C-5, C-6, C-7,
or C-8 District or residential use or are within 200 feet of a public street shall also be obscured from view
from the public street, District, or residential use.
Required screening to obscure such views shall be created with either (1) a building or (2) by a wall
constructed of approved ornamental material in accordance with Title III Article 1, Section 1.06.
Section 1.06 SCREENING WALLS AND FENCING.
The regulations that are given in this section require the provision of protective screening walls and
fences for commercial and industrial uses. The purpose for requiring screening is to insure that views and
noise from businesses shall be obscured from neighboring lots zoned for residential or office use, and to
intercept wind-blown trash and litter. Such walls and fences shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in height,
constructed in compliance with the Building Code and, unless otherwise indicated, located either on the
property line or in a location approved by the Director of Planning and Development Services. It is the
legal responsibility of the owner of the property to insure that walls are installed and maintained, in good
repair, and that such maintenance and repair is assumed by and carried out, whether by the owner,
property user or other person.
Required screening walls and fences shall be made of the following types of materials:
a. Clear heart redwood, heart cypress, red cedar or 0.40 retention pressure treated Southern
Yellow Pine or other suitable outdoor materials with the appearance of wood.
b. Brick, stone or other suitable like materials (required for walls in M-1 and M-2 Districts)
c. Hard-coat stucco or tabby.
d. Chain-link fencing is permitted in front yards and yards adjacent to a street only when
located in M-districts. Other fencing, where permitted, shall be a minimum of eighty (80)
percent opaque and have openings no larger than two and one-half inches (2 ½) inches in
width.
2/2/2009 III - 8
A. Commercial and Mixed-Use Districts.
1. Non-residential Buildings and Lots:
Protective screening is required when the following types of buildings or uses are located
on lots that are either abutting to, or are located across an alley from property located in
any of the following districts: R-Districts, C-R, C-5, C-6 or C-7.
a. Lots where new and/or used motor vehicles, mobile homes, boats, recreational
vehicles, farm equipment and construction equipment are parked or stored.
b. Storage areas for building materials such as lumber, brick, sand, gravel and
stone.
c. Motor vehicle repair garages.
d. Car wash facilities.
e. Restaurants, nightclubs, lounges.
f. Grocery stores.
g. Any building that contains, or is altered to contain, three (3) or more businesses.
These regulations apply in the case of new construction, and when occupancy of existing
building changes to any of the uses mentioned above.
2. Additional Fencing Requirements for Car Wash Establishments
Additional fencing is required for car wash establishments because of the unusually large

governed by this ordinance shall bring such communications towers and antenna into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective
date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is
mandated by the controlling federal agency. Owners shall provide documentation showing
that each communication tower is in compliance with all federal requirements. Evidence of
compliance shall be submitted every twelve (12) months.
2. Security Fencing: Communication towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security
fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing
device, provided however, that such fencing shall meet all district zoning
requirements, and that such fencing shall be meet buffering and screening requirements. The
Governing Authority may waive such requirements for alternative tower structures.
3. No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower.

FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction, in which case the Director of
Planning and Development Services shall review a report provided by the applicant
indicating the available lighting alternatives, and shall approve a design that would cause the
least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
5. Finishes: So as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as
possible, towers, antennas and electrical and mechanical equipment shall either maintain a
galvanized steel finish or be painted a neutral color, or color similar to the building or
supporting structure on which it is located, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or
other applicable federal or state agency.
6. Other Structures: At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to
the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that shall blend
the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.

d. Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed
twenty (20) feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be
uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission
building or security facilities and staff/maintenance.
e. In lieu of these standards, the City/County Commission may allow use of any
alternative detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening, including
plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and
accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by
the provisions above, except as lesser requirements are desirable for adequate
visibility for security purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide
agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms. In certain
locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote
agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping
requirement may be reduced or waived by the City/County Commission.

obscure any view to the anchor from adjoining properties.
c. Other setbacks: Other associated structures, parking areas, and other use areas
associated with the transmission use other than the transmission tower shall meet the
setbacks required in the zoning district where the tower is located. For the purpose of
encouraging and accommodating shared uses, a proposed reduction of setback
requirements for a such additional structures and areas may be approved, by up to a to
fifty (50) percent reduction, in order to accommodate the placement of additional
buildings or other supporting equipment; provided that safety, access, visual impacts,
and standards for uses are met, including the mitigation of any potential adverse
effects on adjacent property.
d. Multiple towers: Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted,
provided that all setback, design and landscape requirements are met for each tower.
Structures are permitted to be located as close to each other as technically feasible,
provided that the tower failure characteristics shall not lead to multiple failures in the
2/2/2009 III - 34
event that one tower fails.
14. Tower separation requirements:
a. No free-standing communication tower shall be allowed within a one thousand
(1,000) foot radius of an existing tower within a residential area.
b. All free-standing towers constructed after the effective date of this ordinance shall
conform to the following minimum tower separation requirements:
Table III. 1.41 Tower Height and Separation Requirements
Tower Height Separation
<50 300
51-100 500
101-150 750
150+ 1000
Towers and antennas mounted on rooftops or alternative tower structures shall be exempt from
these minimum separation distances.
D. Shared use of towers encouraged: All new towers shall be designed to structurally accommodate
the maximum number of additional users technically practicable
Once a new tower is approved, additional antennas and accompanying accessory uses are
permitted to be added to it in accordance with the approved share plan, if the Governing
Authority finds that the standards of this ordinance are met.
E. Special Approval of the City/County Commission: An application for special approval of the
City/County Commission, for a use permitted under this ordinance only after special approval of
the City/County Commission, shall include a site plan from the applicant. The application shall
be handled in accordance with Title II Article 5 of this ordinance.

of an alternative tower structure shall be made in accordance with the Zoning Ordinance. An
application shall not be considered until it is complete. A complete application shall contain the
following:
1. An inventory of the applicants existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the
City of Albany/Dougherty County or within one (1) mile of the border thereof, including
specific information about the location, height and design of each tower. The Governing
Authority may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative
approvals or special-use permits under this ordinance or other organizations seeking to
locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the City of Albany/Dougherty County; provided,
however, that the Governing Authority is not, by sharing such information, in any way
representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
2/2/2009 III - 35
2. Site plan or plans to scale specifying the location of tower(s), guy anchors (if any),

4. Utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewerage, drainage and power lines
impacting the proposed tower site.
5. An environmental impact statement fully describing the effects and impacts that the
proposed tower and/or antenna shall have on the environment and surrounding area
including adjacent residential structures and districts, structures and sites of historic
significance, streetscapes, and the radiological impact on human health.
6. A certified statement, prepared by an engineer licensed to practice in the State of Georgia,
that the construction of the tower, including reception and transmission functions, shall not
interfere with the usual and customary transmission or reception of radio, television, etc.
service enjoyed by adjacent properties.
7. A description of anticipated maintenance needs, including frequency of services, personnel
needs, equipment needs and traffic, noise or safety impacts of such maintenance.
8. A report from a professional structural engineer licensed in the State of Georgia
documenting the following:
a. Tower height and design, including technical, engineering, economic and other
pertinent factors governing selection of the proposed design. A cross-section
of the tower structure shall be included.
b. Total anticipated capacity of the structure, including number and types of
antennas which can be accommodated.
c. Evidence of structural integrity of the tower structure.
d. Failure characteristics of the tower and demonstration that site and setbacks
are of adequate size to contain debris.
e. When application is made with prior approval of the Federal Communications
Commission, and evidence that the approval considered has met application
requirements imposed by this ordinance, the approval of the FCC shall
overrule any items required in Sections 1.41. E, F, G or H. However, FCC
approval shall indicate that all of the items have been considered in their
approval.
9. Written statements from FAA, FCC and any appropriate state review authority stating that
the proposed tower complies with regulations administered by that agency or that the tower
is exempt from those regulations.
10. Letter of intent to lease excess space on the tower structure and to lease additional excess
land on the tower site when the shared-use potential of the tower is absorbed, if structurally
2/2/2009 III - 36
and technically possible.
11. A reasonable pro rata charge may be made for shared use, consistent with an appropriate
sharing of construction, financing and maintenance costs. Fees may also be charged for any
structural or RF changes necessitated by such shared use. Such sharing shall be a condition
of approval, if approval is granted.
a. The applicant shall describe what range of charges is reasonably expected to
be assessed against shared users.
b. The applicant shall base charges on generally accepted accounting principles
and shall explain the elements included in the charge.
12. The applicant shall quantify the additional tower capacity anticipated, including the
approximate number of types of antennas. The applicant shall also describe any limitations
on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses, e.g. radio frequency interference,
mass height, frequency or other characteristics. The applicant shall describe the technical
options available to overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options
available to overcome those limitations were not chosen to be incorporated. The City/County
shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means.
13. Evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna
and the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna.
14. Each applicant shall make a good-faith effort to substantially demonstrate that no existing or
planned towers can accommodate the applicants proposed antenna/transmitter as described
below:
a. The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned towers of a
height roughly equal to or greater than the height of the tower proposed by the
applicant.
b. Such contact shall be made in a timely manner; that is, sufficiently before the
filing of an application for a building or special-use permit to include a response
into the application when filed.
c. Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be relevant if a timely, good faith
effort was made to obtain one. However, where an existing or planned tower is
known to have capacity for additional antennas of the sort proposed, based on the
decision regarding such tower, that application for a new tower shall not be
complete until the owner of the existing or planned tower responds. Such
response is to be required as a condition of approval.
d. The applicant shall submit to the Director of Planning and Development Services
a list of all owners contacted, the date of such contract, the form and content of
such contact, and a record of responses from each owner. The Director of
Planning and Development Services shall maintain on file, and provide on
request, such submitted lists and records of responses from each owner.
e. Once an owner demonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed by the applicant
cannot be accommodated on the owners tower as described below, the owner
2/2/2009 III - 37
need not be contacted by future applicants for antennas of the sort proposed.
15. The applicant shall request the following information from each owner contacted:
a. Identification of the site location, tax lot number, existing uses and tower height.
b. Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the antenna proposed
by the applicant without requiring structural changes to be made to the tower. To
enable the owner to respond, the applicant shall provide each such owner with the
height, length, weight and other relevant data about the proposed antenna.
c. Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the proposed antenna if
structural changes were made, not including totally rebuilding the tower. If so,
the owner shall specify in general terms what structural changes would be
required.
d. If structurally able, would shared use by such existing tower be precluded for
reasons related to RF interference? If so, the owner shall describe in general
terms what changes in either the existing or proposed antenna would be required
to accommodate the proposed tower, if any.
e. If shared use is possible, the fee an owner of an existing tower would charge for
such shared use.
16. Shared use is not precluded simply because a reasonable fee for shared use is charged, or
because of reasonable costs necessary to adapt the existing and proposed uses to a shared
tower. The City/County may consider expert testimony to determine whether the fee and
costs are reasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable.
17. Any other information that may be requested by the City/County to fully evaluate and review
the application and potential impact of a proposed tower and/or antenna.
G. APPEALS.
Appeals from any decision of the City/County Commission shall be made to the Superior Court of
Dougherty County, Georgia, within thirty (30) days of the decision.

2/2/2009 III - 38
communication towers and antennas not in compliance with the Code of Ordinances of the City of
Albany/Dougherty County or that constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance
or removed. The City may seek to have the tower or antenna removed regardless of the owners or
operators intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or
otherwise, which may have been granted.
I. ABANDONED TOWERS.
1. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall
be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of the
tower. The owner of an abandoned tower and the owner of the property where the tower is
located shall be under a duty to remove such a tower or antenna. If such antenna and/or
tower is not removed within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice from the City notifying the
owner(s) of such abandonment, the City may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a
lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The City may pursue all legal remedies
available to it to ensure that abandoned communication towers and antennas are removed.
Delay by the City in taking action shall not in any way waive the Citys right to take action.

residential.
Q. Off-Street Parking Wells. Safe access shall be provided to off-street parking wells. The access of
off-street parking wells to public streets and alleys is regulated by Article I, Section 24-3 of the
Code of the City of Albany and/or Dougherty County regulations.
R. Access to Unpaved Alleys. It is the policy of the City/County Commission that the primary
means of access to a residential structure shall be from a street or paved alley, not from an
unpaved alley. To that end, the following regulations shall apply to construction of a singlefamily
residence or two-family residence on a new lot in a new subdivision. (A new subdivision
is defined as any part of a subdivision, whose construction plans were approved in writing by the
City/County Engineer after July 1, 1980.)
1. When a single-family residence or two-family residence (duplex) is to be constructed on
a lot that is adjacent to an unpaved alley, the off-street parking provided for that
residential structure shall have direct access to a street. This shall not, however, prevent
a resident from having secondary access to an unpaved alley for occasional vehicle use.
2. Off-street parking space shall be provided to the rear of a residential structure only if
such spaces have direct access to a street or paved alley.
3. No structure or addition to any structure, such as a building, utility building, garage,
storage building, wall, fence, greenhouse, or swimming pool, shall be permitted where
the structure or addition impedes vehicular access between off-street parking spaces and
a road. An adjoining alley may provide sole vehicular access to a road only when the
entire length of the alley is paved.
4. When a single-family residence or duplex is to be constructed on a lot that is adjacent to
2/2/2009 III - 47

leading from parking pad to a street or paved alley.
Section 2.02 OFF-STREET PARKING.

and such construction shall be completed and approved by the Building Department and the
Engineering Department before actual use of the property as a parking lot. Plans for the
development of any parking lot shall be submitted as specified, and prepared at a scale of not less
than fifty (50) feet equals one (1) inch and indicating existing and proposed grades, drainage,
water mains and sewers, surfacing and base materials to be used, and the general layout of the
proposed parking lot.
2. All such parking lots shall be hard-surfaced with a pavement having asphalt or concrete or other
hard surface pavement, and shall be graded and drained so as to dispose of surface water that
might accumulate within or upon such area. No surface water from such parking area shall be
permitted to drain into adjoining private property.
3. All illumination for or on such parking lots shall be deflected away from adjacent residential areas
and shall be installed in such manner as to allow the reduction of the amount of light in other than
normal parking hours each day.
4. Side yards shall be maintained for a space of not less than ten (10) feet between the side lot lines
of adjoining residential lots and the parking area. The depth of the front yard or setback line
2/2/2009 III - 48
from the street as established for houses in any block in any given residential area shall be
continued and made applicable to parking space in such residential area and it shall be unlawful to
use the space between such setback line and the sidewalk for the parking of motor vehicles;
provided, however, that the barrier specified in Title II Section 2.01, a (5) shall be located on the
setback line as herein required.
5. Whenever such parking area adjoins residential property and/or a residential street or alley, a
protective wall or landscaping shall be erected and maintained between the required yard space
and the area to be used for parking in accordance with Title II, Section 1.05. Location of said wall
facing or landscaping a residential street shall be determined by the side yard and building setback
requirements adjoining the residential district. The said wall shall be constructed in such a

approaching a stall or window.
ARTICLE 3: NON-CONFORMING USES
Section 3.01 CONTINUANCE AND CHANGE IN USE.
The lawful use of a structure or the lawful use of land existing at the time of the effective date of this
ordinance may be continued although such use does not conform to the provisions hereof. If no
structural alterations are made anywhere on the property, a nonconforming business in a structure may be
changed to another business of the very same type, provided that the structure does not remain vacant or
the business closed for more than one year. Application for expansion of a non-conforming use shall be
made to the Director of Planning and Development Services. The use may be changed to a currently
conforming use at any time.
Section 3.02 NON-CONFORMING USE, DESCRIPTION.
Non-conforming use and non-conforming structure have different meanings, and cannot be use
interchangeably. A use is an activity, such as a residence or business that takes place on a piece of land.
A building or structure may be constructed to contain a use. A non-conforming use is a term that applies
to any activity, such as a residence or business activity, that is not a currently permitted activity, but that
existed prior to the adoption of currently permitted uses. A non-conforming building or structure applies
to buildings and structures that do not meet setback, height or other structural placement or volume
requirements, but which existed prior to current requirements.
Non-conforming uses have a legal right to remain, since zoning cannot legally be made retroactive
concerning uses. For example, a NON-CONFORMING USE could be a business, such as a grocery,
located in a single-family residential zoning district that no longer permits new commercial uses, or a
home located in an industrial district that no longer permits any new residences. Likewise, an open-air
activity that is permitted in the district, such as parking or storage, is not considered a non-conforming
use even when the lot on which the use is located does not meet other zoning district requirements such
2/2/2009 III - 50
for greenbelts, fencing, landscaping, front yard or other site requirements. Further, when a nonconforming
building or structure contains a conforming use, such as a permitted business, the structure is
non-conforming structure while the use is a conforming use. To give another example, a currently
permitted business that is located in a building that has a non-conforming front yard depth, is not a nonconforming
use, but rather a conforming use within non-conforming building. However, in the event that
such building is expanded in the future, the new addition shall be required to observe the required front
yard and other requirements as specified in these regulations.
A land use applies only to an activity, and not the lot or building or structure in which the activity is
located and, as such, a non-conforming lot or structure has no bearing on the status of a use located
within that lot or structure.
Section 3.03 CONTINUATION OF NON-CONFORMING USES.
The non-conforming use of land is permitted to be continued provided that no such non-conforming use
of land shall in any way be expanded or extended.
Section 3.04 DISCONTINUANCE OR ABANDONMENT.
Any non-conforming use of land or building, which becomes vacant and remains unoccupied for a period
of one (1) year, shall thereafter conform to the permitted use provisions of these regulations.
Section 3.05 NON-CONFORMING USE LOCATIONS.
A non-conforming use is not permitted to be expanded, extended or moved to other portions of the
building or parcel of land. If such non-conforming use or portion thereof is discontinued or changed to a
conforming use, any future use of such building or portion thereof shall be in conformity to the permitted
use regulations of the district in which such building is located.
Section 3.06 NON-CONFORMING ALTERATIONS.
No building which houses a non-conforming use shall be enlarged in such a way that improves or
expands the non-conforming use, except to make it comply with requirements of health and safety laws
or regulations; provided further, that the cost of such work shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the tax
department appraised valuation of such building or structure at the time such work is done.
Section 3.07 RESTORATION.
Any building that houses a non-conforming use, which has been destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion,
Act of God or by public enemy to an extent that the remaining value is less than fifty (50) percent or
more of its tax department appraised valuation, exclusive of the foundation at the time such damage
occurred, shall thereafter not be permitted to house any non-conforming use. If such damage is less than
fifty (50) percent of said valuation before said damage occurred, exclusive of the foundation, then such
structure is permitted to be restored to house the same non-conforming use as existed before such
damage, provided that such restoration shall be subject to the Administrative Review (AR) and approval
for a Special Use by the Director of Planning and Development Services. Said restoration shall be
2/2/2009 III - 51
commenced within one (1) year of the date of such partial destruction and shall be diligently carried on to
completion.
Section 3.08 NON-CONFORMING RESIDENCES.
When a non-conforming residence exists as the principal use of any building in the M-1 or M-2 zoning
districts, that building is permitted to be altered, expanded or enlarged, provided that the number of
dwelling units within the building is not thereby increased. Building placement restrictions established
by the Zoning Ordinance for single-family dwellings and two-family dwellings in the C-3 zoning district,
and for multiple-family dwellings in the C-R zoning district, shall apply in the case of this expansion or
alteration. Said expansion, alteration or enlargement shall also comply with all requirements of the
currently adopted Georgia Building Code, and where there is any conflict between this Ordinance and the
currently adopted Georgia Building Code, the more restrictive regulations shall apply.
The regulations given in Title III Article 1, Section 1.15 respecting accessory buildings shall also apply,
in the event an accessory building, related to the non-conforming residence, is constructed.
ARTICLE 4: ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
Section 4.01 ENFORCEMENT.
Administration of the provisions of these regulations shall be the responsibility of the Director of
Planning and Development Services, including related applications for permits and approvals.
Section 4.02 PERMITS.

accordance with the provisions of these regulations, showing that the construction proposed is in
compliance with the provisions of these regulations and with the currently adopted Georgia
Building Code.
No plumbing, electrical, drainage or other permit shall be issued until the Director of Planning
and Development Services has determined that the plans for the designated use indicate that the
structure and premises, if constructed as planned and proposed, shall conform to the provisions
of these regulations.
An existing building shall be considered altered or repaired when changes include any changes in
structural members, stairways, basic construction, type, kind or class of occupancy, light or
ventilation, means of egress and ingress, or any other changes affected by or regulated by any
other pertinent codes of the City/County Commission, except for minor repairs or changes not
2/2/2009 III - 52
involving any of the aforesaid provisions.
B. Permits for New Use of Land. A building permit shall be obtained for any new use of land,
whether presently vacant or where a change in land use is proposed.
C. Permits for New Use of Buildings or Structures. A building permit shall be obtained for any
change in use of an existing building or structure to a different class or type.
D. Special Administrative Permits. The Director of Planning and Development Services shall have
the authority to grant certain limited Administrative Permits as provided in the Zoning Ordinance
and in the Riverfront District ordinance, and shall attach conditions as appropriate to ensure
compliance with such requirements.
E Administrative Review (AR) The Director of Planning and Development Services shall have the
authority to approve certain limited uses or limited variations to code requirements, as provided
in the Zoning Ordinance and in the Riverfront District ordinance, and shall attach conditions as
appropriate to ensure compliance with relevant requirements. Such administrative review may, at
the Directors discretion, be forwarded to the Planning Commission when such uses or variations
are part of a related Planning Commission review, or are otherwise determined by the Director to
merit Planning Commission review. (See Title III Article 5. Section 5.05 C.)
Section 4.03 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
Until such time as the Director of Planning and Development Services shall have issued an
administrative approval stating that the provisions of these regulations have been complied with, it shall
be unlawful and prohibited to issue a certificate of occupancy; to use or permit the use of any land,
building or structure for which a building permit is required; and to use or permit to be used any building
or structure hereafter altered, extended, erected, repaired or moved.
A. Certificate Validity. The Certificate of Occupancy, as required by the currently adopted Georgia
Building Code for new construction or renovations to existing buildings and structures, shall also
constitute Certificates of Occupancy as required by these regulations.
B. Certificates for Existing Buildings. Certificates of Occupancy shall be issued for existing
buildings, structures or parts thereof, or existing uses of land if, after inspection, it is found that
such buildings, structures or parts thereof, or such of land, are in conformity with the provisions
of these regulations.
C. Temporary Certificates. Temporary Certificates of Occupancy may be issued for a part of a
building or structure prior to the occupation of the entire building or structure, provided that such
Temporary Certificate of Occupancy shall not remain in force more than six (6) months, nor
more than five (5) days after the building or structure is fully completed and ready for occupancy
and, provided further, that such portions of the building or structure are in conformity with the
provisions of these regulations.
2/2/2009 III - 53
D. Records of Certificates. A record of all Certificates of Occupancy shall be kept in the office of
the Director of Inspection Department.
E. Certificates for Accessory Buildings to Dwelling. Accessory buildings or structures to dwellings
shall not require a separate Certificate of Occupancy, but rather may be included in the
Certificate of Occupancy for the principal dwelling, building or structure on the same lot when
such accessory buildings or structures are completed at the same time as the principal use.
F. Application for Certificates. Certificates of Occupancy shall be applied for when the application
for a building permit is made and shall be issued within ten (10) days after the erection or
alteration of such building shall have been completed in conformity with the provisions and
requirements of the currently adopted Georgia Building Code and these regulations. If such
Certificate is refused for cause, the applicant therefore shall be notified in writing of such refusal
and the cause thereof within the (10) days.

6. STANDARDS GOVERNING THE EXERCISE OF ZONING POWER
All requests for map amendment shall be evaluated in accordance with the provisions of
any officially adopted Comprehensive Development Plan or any officially adopted
element thereof, of which the Zoning Ordinance is such an element. All such requests
shall be evaluated and determined in accordance with the following standards:
a. Whether the zoning proposal shall permit a use that is suitable in view of the use
and development of adjacent and nearby property.
b. Whether the zoning proposal shall adversely affect the existing use or usability
of adjacent or nearby property.
c. Whether the property to be affected by the zoning proposal has a reasonable
economic use as currently zoned.
d. Whether the zoning proposal shall result in a use that could cause an excessive
or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities or
schools.
e. Whether the zoning proposal is in conformity with the policy and intent of the
Future Land Use Plan, and adopted Comprehensive Plan. Examples include the
County policy on agricultural preservation and the policies regarding mobile
home development.
f. Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and
development of the property, which give supporting grounds for either approval
or disapproval of the zoning proposal.
D. FREQUENCY OF APPLICATION.
No application for a map amendment or any other zoning decision as defined by O.C.G.A. for a
parcel of land shall be made within the twelve (12) month period following the date of denial of

as provided herein, (see E and F below).
E. REAPPLICATION BY THE CITY/COUNTY COMMISSION.
The City/County Commission may file a map amendment application in its own name and may
consider such application before the expiration of the six (6) month delay period following a
denial of a previous map amendment application for the same property, or properties; only when

date of the receipt of the original application.
If an application is withdrawn and refiled, it shall be republished and posted, and a new public
hearing held.
G. CONDITIONAL APPLICATION FOR MAP AMENDMENTS.
1. PURPOSE
Contrasting land uses often result when two (2) very different zoning districts are placed
next to each other. This contrast in land uses may be avoided or reduced, while allowing
the zoning district of the second district to be changed, by limiting the permitted uses of
the second district to uses that are compatible with those permitted in the first zoning
district. Not only may the uses of the second district be limited, but specific conditions
may also be stipulated to further make the use(s) in the second district compatible with
the first. This is called Conditional Zoning.
In no case shall conditions placed on map amendments have the effect of permitting uses
that are otherwise prohibited in the zoning district in which it is located.
2. APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL ZONING MAP AMENDMENT
(CONDITIONAL ZONING)
Between the time an application for a map amendment is filed and the close of its
scheduled public hearing, the property owner or his agent may specify conditions that
further limit the use of the property that is being considered for the map amendment, he
may reduce the number or type of permitted uses; or limit the nature and/or scope of the
permitted uses. In addition, he may specify other acts which he will perform to lessen the
negative impact of the proposed uses on the surrounding neighborhood.
3. APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL ZONING MAP AMENDMENT
2/2/2009 III - 58
(CONDITIONAL ZONING) BY THE CITY/COUNTY COMMISSION
Between the time an application for a map amendment is filed and the call for the final
vote for approval or denial of the application by the City/County Commission, the Albany
Dougherty Planning Commission and/or the City/County Commission may specify
conditions under which the property shall be used if the application is approved. Such
conditions may reduce the number, size or type of permitted uses, limit the location, nature
or scope of permitted uses, restrict permitted uses to a specified activity, require or limit
parking, access, service and other vehicular areas, improve pedestrian access, restrict the
number and type of property improvements that can be made, require the property owner to
carry out specific acts or property improvements that will lessen the potential negative
impact of the proposed use on the surrounding neighborhood, and similar conditional
zoning requirements.
After the close of the public hearing, any conditions stipulated shall not be made less
restrictive than those that were presented at the time of the public hearing.
4. DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED FOR CONDITIONAL ZONING APPROVAL
a. LETTER OF INTENT AND SITE PLAN
When a property owner or his agent initiates an application for a conditional map
amendment, whether or not it is modified by stipulation with the property owner
or by the City/County Commission, the applicant initiating the request for map
amendment shall provide four (4) copies of a letter of intent and four (4) copies
of a site plan. When the City/County Commission initiates an application for a
conditional map amendment, the City/County Commission shall provide four (4)
copies of a letter of intent and four (4) copies of a site plan. The letter of intent
shall include a detailed statement specifying what uses shall be permitted to be
made of the property and how they shall be conducted.
The Site Plan shall show as a minimum: (1) the property boundaries, (2) the
location of the exterior walls of all buildings on the property, (3) location of
points of ingress and egress, (4) parking spaces and driveways if appropriate, (5)
a title, date, scale, name of author and north orientation, (6) the placement of
improvements required by the conditions. The site plan shall be drawn to scale.
b. CERTIFICATION
Upon approval by the City/County Commission, the letter of intent and site plan
shall be certified by the City/County Clerk indicating said approval. One (1)
copy of the site plan and letter of intent shall be returned to the applicant, the
second copy shall be forwarded to the Director of Planning and Development
Services, the third copy shall be retained by the City/County Clerk, and the
fourth copy shall be filed with the record of rezoning.
2/2/2009 III - 59
5. ALTERING THE CONDITIONS.
After conditional approval is granted by the City/County Commission, alteration of the
conditions as established in the certified letter of intent and site plan, including but not
limited to a change in use to any other use permitted in the subject zoning district, shall
be made by the City/County Commission only after referral to and receipt of a
recommendation from the Albany Dougherty Planning Commission, and after holding a
public hearing in accordance with established procedure.
H. MAP LABELS.
1. Zoning districts constrained by conditional map amendments shall be identified on the
map of the zoning ordinance by a lower case letter "c" placed as a suffix behind the
Zoning District Classification, e.g. R-1c or C-3c.
2. The date the conditional map amendment is approved by the City/County Commission
shall also be placed on the map of the Zoning Ordinance in such a manner that it clearly
refers to the appropriate district classification label, e.g. C-3c 12/25/99.
Section 4.05 PERFORMANCE BONDS.
The City/County Board Commission may impose a monetary requirement in the form of performance or
surety bonds, in order insure a property owners strict compliance with any permit, regulation or
condition of zoning pertaining to physical site improvements. Such imposed monetary requirement may
be a contingency to securing a zoning amendment, special approval or variance. The property owner may
be required to furnish a performance or surety bond or letter of credit or cashiers check executed by a
reputable surety company authorized to do business in the State of Georgia in an amount determined by
the City/County Commission to be reasonably necessary to insure compliance hereunder; provided,
however, that in fixing the amount of such performance of surety bond, consideration is given to the size
and scope of the proposed improvement project, current prevailing cost of rehabilitating the premises
upon default of the operator, estimated expenses to compel operator to comply to Court Decree, and such

Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon meeting
all the following specified findings of the Planning Commission.
a. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular
piece of property in question and because of its size, shape or topography, and
b. The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would

impair the purposes and intent of these regulations, provided, however, that no
variance shall be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is
prohibited by these regulations.
In exercising the foregoing powers, whenever the Planning commission grants a variance, the

requirements where, in the particular instance, such modifications shall not be
inconsistent with the purpose and intent of such requirements.
3. Permit modification of regulations related to height, or to square-foot area, as may be
necessary to secure an appropriate improvement of a lot that is of such shape or so
located with relation to surrounding development or physical characteristics that it
cannot otherwise be appropriately improved without such height or area modification.
4. Permit temporary buildings and uses for periods not to exceed six (6) months.

c. Title III Article 3, Section 3.07 Restoration of Non-Conforming Uses
C. Standards for uses: In the Planning Commissions consideration of actions for appeals, special
exceptions and variances related to or involving existing uses, or uses that are otherwise
permitted within the zoning district, it shall be first determined that all foregoing requirements
under Title III Article 5, Section 5.05 A. and 5.05 B are met and, in addition, the following use
standards related to effects and impacts of uses on adjacent property are met.
1. The proposed use shall be of such location, size and character that it shall be in harmony
with the appropriate and orderly development of the surrounding neighborhood.
2. The proposed use shall be of a location, orientation and nature that shall make safe both
vehicular and pedestrian traffic related to that use, and shall be no more hazardous or of a
nuisance to the surrounding area than is normal for the district involved; taking particular
consideration of vehicular turning movements in relation to routes of pedestrian and
vehicular traffic flow, proximity and relationship to intersections, adequacy of sight
distances, access to off-street parking, interface with pedestrian routes, and safety provisions
at pedestrian crossings with particular attention to minimizing child-vehicle contacts in
residential districts.
3. The proposed use shall have a location, size, intensity, site layout, time period and operating
hours that is designed and implemented to eliminate any possible nuisance that might be
noxious to the occupants of any other nearby permitted uses, whether by reason of dust,
noise, fumes, vibration, smoke, lights or other nuisance.
4. Within the site on which the use is located, the location and height of buildings or structures
and the location, nature and height of walls and fences shall be such that the proposed use
shall not interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land
and buildings or unreasonably affect their value.
D. Conditions: The Planning Commission, in acting on any appeal, special exception, variance, or
other authorized action, may attach any conditions to its approval that it finds necessary to
accomplish the reasonable application of the foregoing requirements for findings, standards and
other authorization. Such conditions shall be clearly stated in the minutes of the meeting at
which the conditions were attached.
E. Perpetuation of nonconforming conditions is not intended: In exercising the foregoing powers,
2/2/2009 III - 64

on abutting or nearby properties, shall not be considered legitimate grounds for the issuance of
an appeal, special exception, variance or any other authorized action by the city staff or by the
Planning Commission.
Section 5.06 NOTICE OF HEARING.
The Planning Commission in conducting any public hearing shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of
the appeal and shall give public notice thereof and post a sign on the property in question. Upon the
hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent.

a period longer than six (6) months unless such use is established within such period; provided, however,

continue in force and effect if a building permit for said erection or alteration is obtained within such
period, and such erection or alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with such
permit.
