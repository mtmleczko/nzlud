VALLEY CENTER, KANSAS - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Valley Center, Kansas 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 5, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
 
PREFACE 
The Valley Center, Kansas Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1972, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 5, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Ronald H. Rogg, city attorney. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 5, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 1334, passed September 17, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, Code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 5, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a Code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" Code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior Code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 5, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 5, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 5, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this Code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 5, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in Codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission.

If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

E.  When any contact with or damage to any underground facility occurs, the operator of such utility shall be informed immediately by the city. The city employee responsible for the excavation shall also immediately notify the public works director, who shall notify the city administrator. If the protective covering of an electrical line is penetrated or dangerous gases or fluids are escaping from a broken line, the employee immediately shall inform emergency personnel and take any other action as may be reasonably necessary to protect persons and property and to minimize hazards until arrival of the operator's personnel or public safety responders. 
City employees shall exercise such reasonable care as may be necessary for the protection of any underground facility in and near the construction area when working in close proximity to any such underground facility. Any employee or agent of the city found by competent evidence to have violated this policy shall be presumed negligent of their duty and be subject to termination or dismissal.

Such notification shall identify those provisions of the permit or this chapter which are not being met by the SWP3, and identify which provisions of the SWP3 require modification in order to meet such requirements. Within ten (10) days of such notification from the environmental compliance officer, the owner shall make the required changes to the SWP3 and shall submit to the environmental compliance officer a written certification from the owner that the requested changes have been made. 
10.  The owner shall amend the SWP3 whenever there is a change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance, which has a significant effect on the potential for the discharge of pollutants to the MS4 or to the waters of the United States, and which has not otherwise been addressed in the SWP3, or if the SWP3 proves to be ineffective in eliminating or significantly minimizing pollutants, or in otherwise achieving the general objective of controlling pollutants in stormwater discharges. 
11.  Qualified personnel (provided by the owner of the construction site) shall inspect disturbed areas that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or exit the site, at least once every seven calendar days and within twenty-four (24) hours of the end of the storm that produces one-half inch or greater of precipitation. Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system. Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall be observed to endure that they are operating correctly. Where discharge locations or points are accessible, they shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters or the MS4. Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected for evidence of off-site sediment tracking. 
12.  Based on the results of the inspections required by subsection (B)(11) of this section, the pollution prevention measures identified in the SWP3 shall be revised as appropriate. Such modifications shall provide for timely implementation of any changes to the SWP3 within ten (10) calendar days following the inspection.

17.02.02 Overlapping or Contradictory Regulations. Where the conditions imposed by the provisions of these regulations upon the use of land or structures are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provision of any other applicable law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive and impose higher standards or requirements shall govern.

A. For all purposes except single-family residential developments platted and recorded after January 1, 1992, nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to require any change in plans, construction or designated use of any land or structure in the event that: (See Section 17.02.07 for Vesting of Development Rights.)

(See Section 17.02.09 for definition of STRUCTURE.)
17.03.03 New Uses of Old Structures. If a use of any structure is hereafter changed to another, then the new use must comply with the use regulations of these regulations, unless permitted by provisions in Chapter 17.08. The mere establishment of the new use does not require an existing structure to conform to the lot size requirements or the bulk regulations.

Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 25
Districts, Zoning Maps and Boundaries.
17.03.06 Establishment of Districts. The zoning jurisdiction is hereby divided into the districts as described in Chapter 17.04. References to “residential districts” shall mean those districts in which residential uses are the main permitted use. References to “business districts” shall mean those districts in which commercial uses are the main permitted uses. References to “industrial districts” shall mean those districts in which industrial uses are the main permitted use. The “flood plain district” is considered as an overlay zone to be used in conjunction with the other districts.
17.03.07 Boundaries. In the event that uncertainties exist with respect to the intended boundaries of the various districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map(s), the following rules shall apply:
A. Where boundary lines are indicated as approximately following streets, alleys, easements, railroads, rivers, streams or bodies of water, such boundaries shall be construed as following the centerlines thereof or otherwise are construed to coincide with lot or tract lines, unless otherwise indicated.
B. Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of boundaries as stated in Section 17.03.07.A above, the district boundaries shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the zoning map, unless an exact distance is shown.
C. Where a district boundary line divides a lot or unsubdivided property in single ownership, the regulations for either portion of the lot may, at the owner’s discretion, extend to the entire lot, but not more than 25 feet beyond the boundary line of the district.
17.03.08 Zoning Maps.
A. The boundaries of the districts described in 17.04 are as indicated on the Official Zoning Map(s) which is on file with the Zoning Administrator and identified on its face as part of these regulations. The zoning map(s) with all notations, references and other matters shown thereon is as much a part of these regulations as if specifically set forth herein. (See Section 17.09.01.A8 for zoning map(s) certificate and revisions.)
B. It is the intent of these regulations that the entire area of the zoning jurisdiction, including all the land and water areas, rivers, streets, alleys and railroads and other right-of-way, be included in the districts established in these regulations. Any area not shown on the zoning map(s) as being included in any district shall be deemed to be in the most restrictive district.
17.03.09 Zoning of Right-of-Way. All streets, alleys, public ways, waterways and railroad right-of-way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zone as the property immediately abutting them. Where the centerline of a street, alley, public way, waterway or railroad right-of-way serves as a district boundary, the zoning of such areas, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to such centerline.

Supplemental Requirements.
17.03.22 Average Setback in Existing Residential Districts.
On streets where a front yard more than that required by these regulations has been maintained for existing structures on lots having a frontage of 50% or more of the total frontage on one side of that portion of the street line between two intersecting streets, there shall be maintained a front yard setback of not less than the average setback of the existing structures; provided, that these regulations shall not be interpreted to require a front yard setback of more than 50 feet.
On streets where a front yard less than that required by these regulations has been maintained for existing structures on lots having a frontage of 50% or more of the total frontage on one side of that portion of the street line between two intersecting streets, the front yard setback need not be greater than the average setback of the existing structures; provided, that these regulations shall not be interpreted to permit a front yard setback of less than 20 feet.
17.03.23 Access to Business and Industrial Districts. No land which is located in a residential district shall be used for a driveway, walkway or access purpose to any land which is located in any business or industrial district.
17.03.24 Annexed Land. All land which may hereafter be annexed shall retain its existing County zoning classification until such time as the property owner, Planning Commission or Governing Body may file an application for rezoning to a City zoning classification. If such rezoning is not initiated by the property owner, then the Planning Commission may initiate an application(s) to determine the proper zoning. Rezoning may also be considered during the process of annexation. While the Planning Commission may hold their required public hearing on a rezoning amendment or a special use prior to annexation, the zoning ordinance approving the amendment or special use cannot be effectuated until the land is first officially annexed by a separate annexation ordinance. While both ordinances may be published on the same day, the annexation ordinance must be published first if they are published on separate days. (See Appendix for Table of Comparability of Zoning Districts.)
17.03.25 Dedication of Right-of-Way and Easements. As a condition related to a rezoning amendment or a special use, the dedication of additional street right-of-way; easements for utilities, drainage, access control, fire lanes, building setback lines and other purposes; and the construction, removal or replacement of public improvements necessary to the proper development of the property, may be required either by platting or replatting the land according to the City Subdivision Regulations or, in lieu of platting, by a legal document effectuating such dedications and improvements. Such condition may be required whether the property is being divided or held in single ownership. A stated time limit not exceeding one year may be established to ensure compliance with the above conditions during which time the effectuation of the zoning amendment or special use having been approved with such conditions by the Governing Body shall be withheld from publication by the Clerk. Failure to comply with the conditions during the stated period shall result in making the zoning amendment or special use null and void. No extension of the time period may be granted without reapplication.
17.03.26 Floodplain Requirements. Within any floodplain area as delineated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, no use of land shall commence or no structure shall hereafter be constructed, structurally altered, extended, enlarged or moved under these regulations, unless it also complies with the floodplain regulations. (See Article 18, Floodplain District.)

B. Whenever a zoning lot is used for other than a residential unit as described in Section 17.03.29.A above, more than one principal structure and use may be located on the lot in common ownership, but only when the structures and uses conform to all requirements of the district in which the lot is located.
C. Whenever any structures are developed as condominiums, more than one principal structure may be located on the lot; provided, the definition of a condominium in Section 17.02.09 is met as well as the requirements of Sections 17.03.15 and 17.03.11.

The floor area contained in the portable storage containers shall be limited to no more than 10% of the floor area of the principal use, except that for principal structures with less than 3,200 square feet in size, the container may be up to 320 square feet in size. In structures with multiple tenants, no single user shall be permitted more than 10% of the floor area of its use.
2. Portable storage containers shall meet all required setbacks in the zoning district.
3. Screening from residential zoning districts is required. No openings shall face a public street or adjacent property in a residential zoning district. If the wall(s) match the predominant material and colors of the existing structure or are a neutral color that complements and appears inconspicuous against the color of the principal structure, then additional screening will not be required.

17.03.33 Restrictions on Allocation and Disposition of Required Yards or Open Space.
A. No part of the lot area, or of a yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or loading space provided in connection with any structure or use in order to comply with these regulations shall, by reason of change of ownership or otherwise, be included as part of the minimum lot area, or of a yard, or open space, or off-street parking or loading space required for any other structure or use, except as specifically provided herein.

A. Wherever a manufactured or mobile home is moved from a zoning lot within a district in which it is a permitted use, another manufactured or mobile home meeting the requirements of the district may be moved onto the lot at any time; provided, such home shall be skirted or placed on a permanent-type, enclosed perimeter foundation.
B. In the case of a lawful, nonconforming manufactured or mobile home use, if such a home is moved off a zoning lot, no replacement of a manufactured or mobile home is permitted other than a residential-design manufactured home as defined in Section 17.02.09 and only in residential districts where such home is permitted.
C. No manufactured or mobile home, or portion thereof, shall be moved onto any lot or parcel or an existing home converted for storage or any other purpose than for a residence in any district and no such home shall be temporarily or permanently located in any district not otherwise permitting such homes. These provisions do not preclude the use of prefabricated mobile structures designed for offices in business or industrial districts, but not manufactured/-mobile homes unless specifically permitted.
D. In the event of disasters, such as fires, tornados or floods, whereby expediency is an important factor, a manufactured home may be located temporarily in any district at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator with appropriate conditions attached for a stated period of time.
17.03.36 Screening and Landscaping.
A. Screening and/or landscaping shall be provided when a zoning permit is issued on all properties developed for multiple-family, Manufactured Home Park and all nonresidential uses when such uses are established on property within or adjacent to any residential districts in accordance with standards and procedures as listed below. In anticipation of a need for screening, such matters are proper subjects to be discussed and, if deemed desirable, decided at any hearing for a zoning district amendment or a special use. In addition to the requirement for screening as stated above, screening may further be required at such a hearing to preserve the value of an existing use or the potential for future development of any adjacent land or land across a right-of-way.
B. Screening shall be provided along all side or rear lot lines adjacent to such residential districts.
C. Landscaping shall be provided along a front lot line to the depth of at least 10 feet whenever such front lot line is adjacent to or across from such residential districts. No

other uses except driveways and signs as permitted by Chapter 17.07 shall be allowed in such a landscaped area.
D. Screening shall be provided on all required development sufficient to reasonably hide from ground level view all loading docks, trash receptacles, outdoor storage, outdoor display, outdoor working areas, parking spaces and similar uses from such residential districts.
E. Screening on the side or rear lot line may be reduced in height and intensity in the front yard area extending to the front lot line, i.e., the street right-of-way; however, screening shall not be required along such lot lines in that portion of the front yard which may be landscaped.
F. Whenever properties are developed adjacent to an alley, screening may be omitted at driveways deemed essential for ingress and egress to uses established on the property.
G. Screening may consist of fencing and/or landscaping provided that such screening will serve to adequately reduce:
1. The visual effects on the environment caused by adjacent nonresidential or higher density residential uses
2. Noise
3. Lighting
4. Glare
5. Blowing trash
H. All screening and landscaping shall meet the requirements of the vision triangle in Section 17.03.37. (See Section 17.02.09 for definition of VISION TRIANGLE.)
I. Landscaping along the front lot line shall involve bringing the soil surface to a smooth finished grade and installing sufficient trees, shrubs, ground cover and grass to soften building lines, provide shade and generally produce a pleasing visual effect of the premises.
J. The selection of landscape materials shall consider the "mature" growth and habit of such plants so that vegetation will not overhang or obstruct the public street or a sidewalk area in such a manner as to conflict with pedestrian and vehicular access.
K. The type of fencing should be compatible with the kind and intensity of the land use and the architectural style of the development and adjacent properties.
L. Whenever such screening is required, a screening plan for the area shall accompany the application for a zoning permit. Such plan shall be transmitted to the Planning Commission for their review and approval prior to the issuance of the zoning permit.
M. The screening plan shall be in such detail as to provide enough information to determine if the plan meets the above criteria. Such plan shall contain the location, type and height of any fence and the location, mature size and the type of any plant materials along with their common and botanical names. The sizing, grading and condition of the plant materials shall be specified according to the American Association of Nurserymen Standards.

Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 35
N. The Planning Commission may, in its discretion, temporarily or permanently waive the requirements for screenings and/or landscaping if:
1. The adjacent land use in the residential district may not necessitate nor benefit from such a requirement; or
2. The adjacent land use may already have provided adequate screening for which additional screening may be a duplication; or
3. The future land use for the adjacent area can not readily be determined at this time and that upon mutual agreement of the Planning Commission and the applicant, screening requirements may be waived and the matter reviewed at a specified date in the future. In the meanwhile, the Planning Commission shall require that either a letter of assurance or a covenant be submitted to run with the land; or a guarantee in the form of a corporate security bond, cashier’s check, escrow account or other security be submitted to ensure that such requirements will be met when a determination is made. The Planning Commission may determine the sufficiency of the assurance based on the length of time anticipated before a decision, the size and cost of the potential work involved, and the need to ensure that the requirement is met regardless of any change in ownership.
4. This section shall not prevent the Planning Commission from requiring temporary screening on all or a portion of a side or rear yard wherein a nonresidential use is proposed for development adjacent to an existing single-family dwelling and thereby a potential nuisance or hazard may be created for the homeowner.
O. All plant materials shall be healthy and/or fencing in place prior to issuance of an occupancy certificate. A temporary certificate may be issued as provided for in Section 17.03.36 without the landscaping installation; provided, written assurances are given which are satisfactory to the Zoning Administrator that the planting will take place when the proper season arrives.
P. Maintenance.
1. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain in good condition all of the required screening and landscaping improvements on his property. When it is determined by the Zoning Administrator that improvements required by Section 17.03.36 are not being maintained, it is his duty to give notice in writing to the property owner. Such notice shall specify in what manner the improvements are in need of maintenance and a date for compliance. The owner shall have not less than 30 days to comply with the notice; provided, however, that any person aggrieved by any such order and disagreeing with any of the requirements of the notice may file an appeal under Section 17.10.07 within the 30-day filing period with the Board of Zoning Appeals.
2. If the owner of the land has failed, refused or neglected to make the necessary maintenance repairs within the time of the notice or time designated by the Board, then the Zoning Administrator shall cause such maintenance to be done to the property. The cost of maintenance shall be certified by the Administrator to the Clerk, who shall cause the costs to be assessed against the property on which the maintenance repairs were made.
Q. To assist in reviewing screening and landscape plans, the Planning Commission may from time to time adopt design criteria in the form of policy statements which may include illustrations.

17.03.38 Wind Energy Conversion Systems
A. Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to provide a regulatory scheme for the construction and operation of Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS) in the City of Valley Center and the surrounding three mile jurisdiction area, subject to reasonable restrictions, which will promote the conversion of wind energy to electricity, while preserving the public health and safety.
B. Findings. Valley Center finds that wind energy is an abundant renewable and nonpolluting energy resource and that its conversion to electricity will help to reduce dependence on nonrenewable energy resources and thereby decrease the air and water pollution that results from the use of conventional energy sources. Wind energy systems also enhance the reliability and power quality of the power grid, reduce peak power demands and help diversify the state’s energy supply portfolio. It is also recognized that issues related to aesthetics, safety, noise, and effects on nearby property values are important in the siting and installation of WECS in Valley Center and the surrounding area Therefore, it is necessary to standardize and streamline the proper issuance of permits for WECS so that this clean renewable energy resource can be utilized in a cost-effective and timely manner.
C. Definitions. The following definitions should be used in the interpretation of this article:
ABANDONED means, without limitation to have ceased to be maintained, discarded, left deserted, or control of a WECS being given up.

Valley Center Zoning Ordinance PUD Planned Unit Development District
64 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
17.04.12 PUD Planned Unit Development District. The purpose of the Planned Unit Development District, herein referred to as PUD is to:
? encourage innovation in residential, commercial and industrial development by permitting greater variety and flexibility in type, design and layout of buildings;
? encourage a more efficient use of land reflecting changes in the technology of land development;
? encourage development which incorporates the best features of modern design, while conserving the value of land;
? provide a procedure which relates the type, design and layout of residential, commercial and industrial development to the particular site and the particular demand for housing at the time of development in a manner consistent with the preservation of property values;
? require all residential development on property of over 20 acres; and commercial or industrial development on property of over two acres to establish a PUD.
The PUD District operates as an overlay zone in conjunction with all of the other districts in that it is necessary for an area to concurrently be zoned for one or more of the other districts in addition to the PUD District designation; however, such other districts may differ in one or more respects when utilized for the PUD District.
A. General Provisions.
1. The Governing Body may by ordinance approve the establishment of a PUD District on any parcel or tract of land which is suitable for and of sufficient size to be planned and developed, or redeveloped, as a unit and in a manner consistent with the intent and purpose of these regulations and with the Comprehensive Plan.
2. A PUD District may be established for a residential development or for a general development. A development shall be deemed to be a residential development when it is limited to dwelling units in detached, attached or clustered, or multiple-storied structures, or any combination thereof; and nonresidential uses of a religious, cultural, recreational and business character that are primarily designed and intended to serve the residents of the residential development. A development shall be deemed to be a general development when it contains major business and/or industrial structures and uses exclusively, or when it blends residential structures or dwelling units in a unified plan with business and/or industrial structures and uses.
3. As a convenience for all references and filing purposes, the specific name of the proposed development shall precede all references to it being a "planned unit development district", a "preliminary planned unit development plan,” or a “final planned unit development plan”. All amendments thereto shall be denoted by adding the word "amended" following the name of the development and before any reference to its status as a district or plan. The letters "PUD" shall serve as an acceptable abbreviation for the words "planned unit development".
B. Standards and Criteria for Planned Unit Developments.
1. For all planned developments:
a. A development plan that is not inconsistent with the standards set out in this section or with such general policies or specific rules and regulations for PUD Districts as may be adopted from time to time by the Governing Body or the Planning Commission and placed on public record in the office of the City Clerk shall prima facie be deemed to have qualified for preliminary approval. No such policies, rules or regulations shall be revised or added to so as to be applicable to a specific proposal for a PUD after an application for preliminary approval of a
PUD Planned Unit Development District Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 65
specific PUD plan has been filed. A PUD plan shall not be inconsistent with the following general standards for use of land, and the use, type, bulk, design and location of buildings, the density or intensity of use, the common open space, the public facilities and the development by geographic division of the site:
1) The PUD will not substantially injure or damage the use, value and enjoyment of surrounding property nor hinder or prevent the development of surrounding property in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan.
2) The site will be accessible from public roads that are adequate to carry the traffic that will be imposed upon them by the proposed development and the streets and driveways on the site of the proposed development will be adequate to serve the residents or occupants of the proposed development. Traffic control signals will be provided without expense to the City when it is determined that such signals are required to prevent traffic hazards or congestion in adjacent streets.
3) The PUD will not impose an undue burden on public services and facilities such as fire and police protection.
4) The entire tract or parcel of land to be occupied by the PUD shall be held by a single landowner, or if there are two or more landowners, the application for such PUD shall be filed jointly by all such landowners; however, the holder of a contract to purchase or other person having an enforceable proprietary interest in such land shall also be deemed a landowner for purposes of these regulations.
5) The PUD plan shall contain such proposed covenants, easements and other provisions relating to the bulk, location and density of residential buildings, nonresidential uses and structures, and public facilities as are necessary for the welfare of the PUD and are not inconsistent with the best interests of the area. Such covenants, easements and other provisions, if part of the PUD plan as finally approved, may be modified, removed or released only with the consent of the Governing Body after a public hearing before and recommendations by the Planning Commission as provided in Section 17.04. 12.C. All such covenants shall specifically provide for enforcement by the City in addition to the landowners within the development.
6) The Planning Commission may designate divisible geographic sections of the entire parcel to be developed as a unit, and shall, in such case, specify reasonable periods within which development of each such unit must be commenced. In the case of residential PUD plans and general PUD plans which contain residential buildings, the Planning Commission may permit in each unit deviations from the number of dwelling units per acre established for the entire PUD; provided, that such deviation shall be adjusted for in other sections of the PUD so that the number of dwelling units per acre authorized for the entire PUD is not affected. The period of time specified in the schedule of development submitted by the applicant for the completion of the entire PUD and the commencement date for each section thereof may be modified from time to time by the Planning Commission to be reasonably required to assure performance in accordance with the PUD plan and to protect the public interest in the event of abandonment of said plan before completion.
7) For all business and industrial uses proposed for development within the plan, the standards and extent of uses shall not exceed the least restrictive requirements for the specific use as provided for in the business and
Valley Center Zoning Ordinance PUD Planned Unit Development District
66 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
industrial districts of these zoning regulations unless they meet the provisions of Sections 17.04.12.B.1a(12) and 17.04.12.C(9).
8) The location and arrangement of structures, parking areas, walks, lighting and appurtenant facilities shall be compatible with the surrounding land uses, and any part of a PUD not used for structures, parking and loading areas, or access ways, shall be landscaped or otherwise improved.
9) When business or industrial structures or uses in a PUD District abut a residential district or residential buildings in the same development, screening shall be provided. In no event shall a business or industrial structure in a PUD District be located nearer than 100 feet to a residential building.
10) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of these regulations, when a shopping center is developed as a PUD District, such shopping center shall have 300 square feet of space devoted to off-street parking for each 100 square feet of floor area in the structures located in the planned shopping center development. Such off-street parking facilities shall otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 17.05.01.A of these regulations.
11) The specifications for the width and surfacing of streets, alleys, ways for public utilities, for curbs, gutters, sidewalks, public parks and playgrounds, school grounds, storm water drainage, water supply and distribution, sanitary sewers and sewage collection and treatment adopted in the Subdivision Regulations of the City as amended from time to time, may, within the limits hereinafter specified, be waived or modified by the Planning Commission where the Commission finds that such specifications are not required in the interests of the residents or occupants of the PUD and that the waiver or modification of such specifications for PUD plans would not be inconsistent with the interests of the City. The Commission shall require guarantees for required public improvements and the filing of comparable engineering and survey data on final development plans.
12) Any modifications of the zoning or other regulations that would otherwise be applicable to the site shall be warranted by the design of the PUD plan, and the amenities incorporated in it, and shall not be inconsistent with the interest of the public generally.
1. Standards for Residential Planned Developments and General Planned Developments Containing Residential Buildings:
a. Any PUD plan that does not propose to increase the number of dwelling units per acre that would otherwise be permitted on the property under the maximum zoning regulations otherwise applicable thereto in the districts which permit residences shall be prima facie qualified for preliminary approval insofar as residential density is concerned. A PUD plan may provide for a greater number of dwelling units per acre than would be permitted by these district regulations otherwise applicable to the site, but if the number of dwelling units per acre exceeds by more than 10% of that permitted by the Zoning Regulations otherwise applicable to the site, the developer has the burden to show that such excess will not have an undue and adverse impact on existing public facilities and on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property. The Planning Commission, in determining the reasonableness of a proposed increase in the number of dwelling units per acre, shall recognize that increased density may be compensated for by additional private amenities and by increased efficiency in
PUD Planned Unit Development District Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 67
public services to be achieved by: (1) the amount, location and proposed use of common open spaces; and (2) the location, design and type of dwelling units. The Planning Commission shall also consider that the physical characteristics of the site may make increased densities appropriate in the particular location. In addition to establishing a maximum density, the plan shall specify either the minimum number of dwelling units and commercial or industrial uses or the minimum acreage allowances for each specific PUD District.
b. When common open space is provided in a PUD plan, the amount and location of such common open space shall be consistent with the declared function of the common open space as set forth in the application for a PUD District. The PUD plan shall include such provisions for the ownership and maintenance of the common open space as are reasonably necessary to ensure its continuity, care, conservation and maintenance, and to ensure that remedial measures will be available to the City if the common open space is permitted to deteriorate or is not maintained in a condition consistent with the best interest of the PUD or of the City. If the City finds it necessary to carry out the obligations required to maintain the open space in order to avoid having it become a public nuisance, the costs shall be assessed against the properties within the development and shall become a tax lien on said properties.
c. When a PUD includes common open space, such common open space shall never be used for the construction of any structure, nor shall such open space ever be computed as a part of the required minimum lot area, or any required yard, of any other structure. Adequate safeguards, including recorded covenants, shall be provided to prevent subsequent development of, and the future construction of structures on, such open space.
d. The total ground area occupied by buildings and structures shall not exceed 35% of the total ground area of the PUD unless previous development in the neighborhood has a greater lot coverage, in which case the PUD plan may increase the lot coverage of buildings and structures to correspond with the bulk of the other structures in the neighborhood.
e. Nonresidential uses of a religious, educational or recreational nature shall be designed or intended primarily for the use of the residents of the PUD.
f. Nonresidential uses of a business character shall be designed or intended to serve principally the residents of the PUD. No structure designed or intended to be used, in part or in whole, for business purposes shall be constructed prior to the construction of not less than 30% of the dwelling units proposed in the PUD plan.
C. Preliminary PUD Plan Contents. An application for a PUD shall constitute the filing of an application for a PUD District and shall be processed in the same manner prescribed for amending these Zoning Regulations. The same requirements for notice to property owners, advertisement of public hearing, protest petitions, and adoption by the Governing Body shall be required as in conventional zoning. The applicant shall prepare and submit a preliminary PUD plan for review and recommendation by the Planning Commission which shall contain the following information and documents:
1. A site plan showing the location, arrangement, bulk, type and use of all existing and proposed structures, the proposed traffic circulation pattern within the development, the areas to be developed for parking, the points of ingress and egress, including access streets where required, the relationship of abutting land uses and zoning districts, proposed lots and blocks, if any, and proposed public or common open
Valley Center Zoning Ordinance PUD Planned Unit Development District
68 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
space, if any, including parks, playgrounds, school sites and recreational facilities.
2. Applicable information as required for a preliminary plat pursuant to provisions in the Subdivision Regulations of the City.
3. A statement of the anticipated residential density (when applicable), the proposed total gross floor area, and the percentage of the development which is to be occupied by structures.
4. Preliminary sketches and/or description of the proposed screening and landscaping features.
5. When a PUD is to be constructed in units, a schedule for the development of such units shall be submitted. No such unit shall have a residential density that exceeds by more than 20% the proposed residential density of the entire PUD. When a PUD provides for common open space, the total area of common open space provided at any stage of development shall, at minimum, bear the same relationship to the total open space to be provided in the entire PUD as the units completed or under development bear to the entire PUD.
6. Evidence that the applicant has sufficient control over the tract to effectuate the proposed plan, including a statement of all the ownership and beneficial interests in the tract of land and the proposed development.
7. When it deems it to be necessary, the Planning Commission may require a traffic survey setting out and analyzing the effect that the PUD will have upon traffic in the streets and thoroughfare adjacent to and in the vicinity of the proposed development.
8. A statement of objectives showing the relationship of the PUD to the Comprehensive Plan with respect to land use for various purposes, density of population, direction of growth, location and function of streets and other public facilities, and common open space for recreation or visual benefit or both, and such other factors as the City may find relevant in making a finding whether a PUD shall be authorized as being in general conformity to the Comprehensive Plan.
9. In the case of general planned developments, a statement identifying the principal types of business and/or industrial uses that are to be included in the proposed development.
10. When a PUD includes provisions for common open space, or recreational facilities, a statement describing the provision that is to be made for the care and maintenance of such open space or recreational facilities. If it is proposed that such open space be owned and/or maintained by any entity other than a governmental authority, copies of the proposed articles of incorporation and bylaws of such entity shall be submitted.
11. Copies of the restrictive covenants that are to be recorded with respect to property included in the PUD District.
D. Action on Preliminary PUD Plan.
1. Hearing, Findings and Recommendation of Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall, within 60 days after a preliminary development plan is filed with it, hold a public hearing on the plan after giving the notice required by Section 17.11.01D for hearings on amendments. Such public hearing shall consider all aspects of the preliminary PUD plan including all proposed units of development. Within 30 days after the last public hearing on such plan, the Commission shall prepare and transmit to the Governing Body and to the applicant specific findings of fact with respect to the extent to which the preliminary PUD plan complies with the standards set out in Sections 17.04.12.B and C, together with its recommendations
PUD Planned Unit Development District Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 69
to the Governing Body with respect to the action to be taken on the PUD plan. The Commission may recommend approval, disapproval or approval with amendments, conditions or restrictions. Copies of the findings and recommendations of the Planning Commission shall be made available to any other interested persons.
2. Action by the Governing Body. After a 14-day period following the public hearing in which to receive protest petitions as provided by Section 17.11.04, the Governing Body shall under the adoption procedures of Section 17.11.05 consider the approval or disapproval of the preliminary PUD plan after it receives the findings and recommendations of the Planning Commission thereon. If the preliminary PUD is disapproved, the applicant shall be furnished with a written statement of the reasons for disapproval of the plan. If the preliminary PUD is to be approved, the Governing Body shall, after receiving from the applicant any acceptance required by Section 17.04.12.D3, adopt an ordinance approving the preliminary PUD plan, and establishing a PUD District for the parcel or tract of land included in the preliminary PUD plan.
3. Restrictions and Conditions. The Governing Body may alter the preliminary PUD plan according to the procedures of Section 17.11.05(2) or (3) and impose such restrictions and conditions on the PUD as it may deem necessary to insure that the development will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of these regulations and with the Comprehensive Plan. When the Governing Body alters the preliminary PUD plan, the applicant shall have 30 days within which to file an acceptance of such alterations, restrictions or conditions. When an acceptance is required by this section, no ordinance approving a preliminary PUD plan and establishing a PUD District shall be effectuated until such acceptance has been filed with the City Clerk.
4. Form of Ordinance. An ordinance approving a PUD and establishing a PUD District shall specify the Zoning Regulations and restrictions that will, pursuant to the PUD plan, apply in the PUD District and shall describe the boundaries of such district or set such boundaries out on a map that is incorporated and published as a part of such ordinance. Such ordinance shall also specify the conditions and restrictions that have been imposed by the Governing Body on the PUD, and the extent to which the otherwise applicable district regulations have been modified. When the Planning Commission has designated divisible geographic sections of the development that may be developed as a unit, the ordinance shall authorize the Planning Commission to modify the schedule of development to the extent set out in Section 17.04.12.B.1a (6).
E. Status of Preliminary PUD Plan after Approval.
1. Within 15 days after the adoption of an ordinance approving a preliminary PUD plan and establishing a PUD District, a copy of such ordinance shall be filed by the City Clerk with the Zoning Administrator and a similar copy mailed to the applicant. When approval of a preliminary plan has been granted, the same shall be noted on the Official Zoning Maps.
2. After being notified of the approval of a preliminary PUD plan by the Governing Body, the applicant shall within 15 days file with the County Register of Deeds a statement that such a plan has been filed with the City and has been approved and that such PUD is applicable to certain specified legally described land and that copies of said plan are on file in the office of the City Clerk. Such statement recorded with the Register of Deeds shall also specify the nature of the plan, the proposed density or intensity of land uses and other pertinent information sufficient
Valley Center Zoning Ordinance PUD Planned Unit Development District
70 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
to notify any prospective purchasers or users of land of the existence of such a plan. The recorded statement shall specify that the preliminary PUD plan shall become binding upon all successors and assigns unless amended in conformance with these regulations.
3. Preliminary approval of a PUD plan shall not qualify such a plan for recording. A PUD plan which has been given preliminary approval as submitted or which has been given preliminary approval with alterations, conditions and restrictions, which have been accepted by the applicant (and provided that the applicant has not defaulted nor violated any of the conditions of the preliminary approval), shall not be modified or revoked nor otherwise impaired by action of the City pending an application or applications for approval of a final PUD plan without the consent of the applicant; provided, that an application for final approval is filed, or in the case of unit developments, provided applications are filed, within the time or times specified in the ordinance granting approval of the preliminary plan. If no time is specified in such ordinance, then an application for approval of the final PUD plan, or all units thereof, shall be filed within three years.
4. In the event that a PUD plan is given preliminary approval and thereafter, but prior to approval of a final PUD plan, the applicant shall: (1) choose to abandon said plan and shall so notify the Planning Commission in writing; or (2) shall fail to file an application, or applications, for approval of a final plan, it shall be deemed to be revoked. When a preliminary plan is revoked, all that portion of the preliminary plan for which final approval has not been given shall be subject to those provisions of the Zoning Regulations and other local ordinances, that were applicable thereto immediately prior to the approval of the preliminary plan, as they may be amended from time to time. The Governing Body shall forthwith adopt an ordinance repealing the PUD District for that portion of the development that has not received final approval and re-establishing the zoning and other regulatory provisions that would otherwise be applicable. When a PUD plan is revoked, such revocation shall be noted on the Official Zoning Maps.
F. Final PUD Plan Contents and Approval.
1. An application for approval of a final PUD plan may be filed for all the land included in a planned development or for a unit thereof. Such application shall be filed by the applicant with the Zoning Administrator within the specified time in Section 17.04.12.E3, and shall be in substantial compliance with the preliminary PUD plan as approved. The application shall include:
a. A detailed site plan showing the physical layout and design of all streets, easements, rights-of-way, lots, blocks and common open space including statements, where applicable, on the residential densities, the types and uses of structures, the maximum gross floor area, the percentage of the development to be occupied by structures, the height of structures and signs, the building setback lines, and the units within which construction would be scheduled.
b. Applicable information as required for a final plat pursuant to the provisions in the City Subdivision Regulations including such waivers and modifications as may have been agreed to in the preliminary PUD plan, including:
c. Plans for landscaping and screening.
d. All certifications of approval required by the City Subdivision Regulations for a final plat with the modification that the words "final PUD plan and plat" shall be utilized wherever the word "plat" appears in the wording.
e. A statement of dedication for easements or right-of-ways and a copy of
PUD Planned Unit Development District Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 71
restrictive covenants.
f. Proof of the establishment and activation of any entity that is to be responsible for the management and maintenance of any common open space and copy of any restrictive covenants.
g. No lot, parcel, or tract or dwelling unit in such development shall be conveyed or leased prior to the recording of the final PUD.
h. Such guarantees and agreements that are required by the provisions and procedures of the Subdivision Regulations regarding final plats.
2. A PUD plan submitted for final approval shall be deemed to be in substantial compliance with the preliminary plan, as approved; provided, that any modification by the developer of the preliminary plan, as approved, does not: (1) vary the proposed gross residential density or intensity of use by more than 5%; or (2) involve a reduction of the area set aside for common open space; nor (3) increase by more than 10% the floor area proposed for nonresidential use; nor (4) increase by more than 5% the total ground area covered by buildings or a substantial change in their height. A public hearing shall not be held to consider modifications in the location and design of streets or facilities for water and for disposal of storm water and sanitary sewerage.
3. Although a public hearing shall not be held on an application for approval of a final PUD plan when said plan as submitted for final approval is in substantial compliance with the preliminary plan, as approved, the burden shall nevertheless be upon the applicant to show the Planning Commission good cause for any variation between the preliminary plan, as approved, and the final plan as submitted. In the event a public hearing is not required for final approval, and the application for final approval has been filed, together with all drawings, specifications and other documents required in support thereof, the Commission shall make recommendations on such final plan; provided, however, that, in the event the final plan as submitted contains variations from the preliminary plan as approved, but remains in substantial compli-ance with the preliminary plan, as approved, the Commission may, after a meeting with the applicant, refuse to recommend approval of the final plan and shall so advise the applicant in writing of such refusal, setting out the reasons why one or more of said variations are not in the public interest. In the event of such refusal, the applicant may re-file his application for final approval without the variations objected to by the Commission at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for final approval. If the time for applying for final approval shall have expired at the time when the Commission advised the applicant that the variations were not in the public interest, then the applicant shall have 60 additional days within which to refile his application for final approval without the said variation. If the applicant shall fail to refile within said period, he shall be deemed to have refused to accept such requirements and final approval shall be deemed to have been denied.
4. In the event the final PUD plan, as submitted for approval, is not in substantial compliance with the preliminary plan as approved, the Planning Commission shall so notify the applicant in writing, setting out the particular ways in which the final plan is not in substantial compliance with the preliminary plan as approved. The applicant may make such changes in the final plan as are necessary to bring it into compliance with the preliminary plan, as provided for in Section 17.04.12.E3, or he may file within 45 days a written appeal with the Commission that it hold a public hearing on his application for final approval. In the event the applicant shall fail to take either of these alternate actions within said time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the plan. Such public hearing shall be held, notice thereof shall be
Valley Center Zoning Ordinance PUD Planned Unit Development District
72 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
given, and the hearing shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in Sections 17.11.01.D, E and F of these regulations. After the conclusion of such public hearing, the Commission shall either recommend approval or disapproval of the final plan. The recommendations on the final plan, shall, in cases arising under this paragraph, be in the form and contain the findings required for a recommendation on an application for approval of a preliminary development plan as set out in Sections 17.04.12.B and C.
5. After a final PUD plan, or any unit thereof, has been submitted for consideration by either the procedures prescribed in Sections 17.04.12.E3 or 4, the plan shall be considered for final approval by the Governing Body within 30 days. A final PUD plan, or any part thereof, which has been given final approval by the Governing Body, shall be filed of record with the County Register of Deeds within 60 days following the satisfying of all conditions precedent and conditioned upon such approval. A copy of the recorded final plan shall also be filed with the Zoning Administrator before any building and/or zoning permits are issued or development takes place in accordance therewith. In the event the Governing Body fails to act, either by approval or by disapproval within the time prescribed, the final plan shall be deemed to be approved. Pending completion within a reasonable time of said PUD, or of any unit thereof, which has been finally approved, no modification of the provisions of said plan, or unit thereof, as finally approved, shall be made except with the consent of the applicant.
6. In the event that a plan or unit thereof is given final approval and thereafter the applicant shall abandon said plan or the section thereof and shall so notify the City in writing, or in the event the applicant shall fail to commence the PUD within 18 months after final approval, it shall terminate and shall be deemed null and void unless such time period is extended by the Governing Body upon written application by the applicant.
G. Modification of the PUD Plan. To further the mutual interest of the residents and owners of the PUD and of the public in the preservation of the integrity of the plan, as finally approved and to insure that modifications, if any, in the plan shall not impair the reasonable reliance of the residents and owners upon the provisions of the plan, nor result in changes that would adversely affect the public interest, the enforcement and modification of the provisions of the plan as finally approved, whether recorded by plan, covenant, easement or otherwise, shall be subject to the following provisions:
1. The provisions of the final plan relating to:
a. The use of land and the use, bulk and location of buildings and structures;
b. The quality and location of common open space; and
c. The intensity of use or the density of residential units shall run in favor of the City and shall be enforceable in law or in equity by the City, without limitation on any powers or regulation otherwise granted the City by law.
2. Modification of the plan by the City. All those provisions of the plan authorized to be enforced by the City under Section 17.04.12.G.1 may be modified, removed or released by the City (except grants or easements relating to the service or equipment of a public utility unless expressly consented to by the public utility), subject to the following conditions:
a. No such modification, removal or release of the provisions of the plan by the City shall affect the rights of the residents and owners of the PUD to maintain and enforce those provisions, at law or equity, as provided in Section 17.04.12.G.2.
PUD Planned Unit Development District Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 73
b. No modification, removal or release of the provisions of the plan by the City shall be permitted except upon a finding by the City, following a public hearing called and held in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, that the same is consistent with the efficient development and preservation of the entire PUD, does not adversely affect either the enjoyment of land abutting upon or across a street from the PUD or the public interest and is not granted solely to confer a special benefit upon any person.
H. Enforcement.
1. Withholding of Building Permits Any previously approved Planned Unit Development Plan that does not comply with conditions that were part of the City Council Ordinance changing the zoning to PUD is not a legal building site. Hence, no Building Permits shall be issued until the PUD property owner is caused to comply with conditions of the adopted Zoning Map amendment Ordinance.
2. Enforcement of Approved PUD Any construction with or without a building permit which is in conflict or inconsistent with the provisions of the approved PUD Site Plan or conditions of the adopted PUD Ordinance shall be voided and structures ordered removed from the PUD zoned property.
3. Penalties Any person, firm, partnership or corporation convicted of a misdemeanor pursuant to a violation of an approved PUD Site Plan and conditions of the adopted PUD Ordinance may be punishable by a fine not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or by imprisonment in the County Jail for a period not more than six (6) months, or by such fine and imprisonment. The imposition of any sentence or fine shall not exempt the offender from compliance with the requirements of the approved PUD Site Plan or conditions of the adopted PUD Ordinance. Each day a violation of these regulations continues to exist may constitute a separate offense.
Valley Center Zoning Ordinance P-O Protective Overlay District
74 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
17.04.13 P-O Protective Overlay District.
This district may be applied as an overlay district in combination with any underlying zoning district except the PUD Planned Unit Development district. By limiting specific uses or requiring more restrictive development standards to individual projects or specific properties, this district is intended to:
? Ensure compatibility among incompatible or potentially incompatible land uses.
? Ease the transition from one zoning district to another.
? Address sites or land uses with special requirements.
? Guide development of unusual situations or unique circumstances.
Development standards include, but are not limited to, lot sizes, bulk requirements, use limitations, off-street parking and loading provisions, accessory structures and uses, sign standards, miscellaneous requirements of and screening and landscape requirements of Chapter 17.03.
A. Use and Development Standards. This district can be used to modify and restrict the use and development standards of an underlying zoning district. All requirements of this district are in addition to and supplement all other applicable standards and requirements of these regulations. Restrictions and conditions imposed by this district shall be limited to the following:
1. Prohibiting otherwise permitted or special or conditional uses and accessory uses; or making an otherwise permitted use a special or conditional use;
2. Decreasing the number or average density of dwelling units that may be constructed on the site;
3. Increasing minimum lot size or lot width;
4. Increasing minimum setback requirements in any yard;
5. Restrictions on access to abutting properties and streets, including specific design features; and
6. Any other development standards required or authorized by these regulations.
B. Method of Adoption. Modifications and restrictions imposed through this district are considered part of this zoning text and accompanying map. All property included in the district shall be identified on the Official Zoning Maps by adding the letters "P-O" and a number to the base zoning district symbol. The number shall be assigned when the application is filed and numbers shall run consecutively beginning with number 1. The effectuating ordinance for zoning or rezoning property to the P-O district shall specifically state the modifications or restrictions imposed pursuant to Section 17.04.13.A. Such modifications and restrictions imposed shall be considered part of the text of these regulations and a violation of them shall be a violation of these regulations. The modifications and restrictions shall continue in full force and effect until revised in accordance with the same amendment procedures as for the approval of the original P-O District.
C. Effect of P-O District Designation. When the P-O District zoning designation is applied in combination with an underlying zoning district, it shall always be considered to result in a more restrictive designation than if the district did not have the P-O classification. In the event that the P-O designation was not originally requested as part of the rezoning application, but is added instead during the public hearing process, re-notification and re-advertisement of the requested zoning amendment shall not be required.

Off-Street Parking and Loading Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 79
CHAPTER 17.05: OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
17.05.01 Off-Street Parking. In any applicable zoning district, all structures built and all uses established hereafter shall provide accessory off-street parking in accordance with the following regulations. When an existing structure or use is expanded, accessory off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with the following regulations for the area or capacity of such expansion. Plans showing the layout and design of all off-street parking spaces and loading areas must be submitted and approved by the Zoning Administrator before a zoning permit is issued for such spaces or areas.
A. General Provisions.
1. Utilization: Accessory off-street parking facilities provided for the uses hereinafter listed shall be solely for the parking of motor vehicles in operating condition of patrons, occupants or employees of such uses. Such parking facilities or any vacant lot shall not be used to display or store motor vehicles including recreational vehicles and utility trailers for sale other than where permitted specifically in a district. Such provision shall not prevent the display of a small temporary for sale sign not exceeding two square feet in size on a personal vehicle when parked periodically on a driveway or an identifiable parking area on a zoning lot of a residence or a business location. (See Section 17.02.09 for definition of STORAGE, OUTDOOR.)
2. Parking space dimension: An off-street parking space shall be at least 9 feet in width and at least 19 feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps or columns, unless special parking is designated for variable sizes of vehicles.
3. Access: Each off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space. Aisle space for 90 degree parking shall be no less than 24 feet in width; when used with 60 degree angle parking, at least 12 feet width with one-way traffic, 22 feet width with two-way traffic; when used with parallel parking or where there is no parking, at least 10 feet wide for one-way traffic.
4. Parking Spaces backing out into Public Street: No parking space shall be designed to exit or back directly onto a public street or use the public right-of-way for parking space, unless specifically approved by the Governing Body. Such arrangements are to be discouraged, except in unusual circumstances wherein the traffic safety of the public can still be protected.
5. Open and enclosed parking: Off-street parking spaces open to the sky may be located in any yard, except that in residential districts no such spaces shall be located in a front yard setback other than for multiple-family dwellings. Principal buildings with private garages and carports integrated into or attached to the buildings which contain or shelter off-street parking spaces shall be subject to the yard setback requirements applicable in the district wherein the buildings are located. Detached garages and carports which contain or shelter off-street parking spaces shall be subject to the provisions of the accessory uses contained in Section 17.06.01 and, in particular, the bulk regulations of Section 17.06.01.C. (See Section 17.03.30 for canopies.)
a. Parking on areas other than a driveway: Permanent or seasonal parking of a vehicle (as defined in 17.02.09 Definitions) on any part of a property not hard surfaced (as defined in 17.02.09 Definitions) is prohibited. If additional off-street parking is needed in the front yard of a property, a hard surface for no more than one additional car width can be added and utilized off an existing driveway approach, and if needed, the driveway approach can be widened to no more than 30 feet on a street. Additional parking width exceeding the above allowance
Valley Center Zoning Ordinance Off-Street Parking and Loading
80 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
in the front yard may be requested by applying for a variance reviewed by the Board of Appeals, however, not more than 35 percent of a front yard of a single family lot can be used for parking under any circumstances. If any rear or side yard parking is used for vehicles, they must be parked on a hard surface. No single family residential lot may have more than 25% of its entire yard area hard surfaced.
b. Design: Off-street parking spaces shall comply with such design standards relating to curb cuts and curb length, stall depth, driveway width, island width, barriers, and the location of ingress and egress as may be established from time to time by the City.
c. Off-street parking spaces may be open or enclosed in a building or structure.
d. Parking on driveways for single and two-family dwellings and all types of manufactured and mobile homes is considered to be permitted temporary parking and required parking spaces on such lots are not to be in the front yard setback. All parking spaces must be in an identifiable area where all spaces are contained thereon. (See Section 17.05.01.A.5c for screening.)
e. Surfacing: All driveways shall be graded and paved with an asphalt, asphaltic concrete, concrete or other comparable hard-surfaced, all weather, dustless material which shall be maintained in good condition; provided, however, graveled parking areas are permitted in the industrial districts and for manufactured and mobile homes in related parks and extra parking spaces for churches beyond the required number. For detached garages and carports the driveways shall meet the above standards for the front yard setback. For the rest of the distance to the detached garage or carport gravel is allowed as the driveway surface.
f. Screening: Screening for parking spaces and loading areas is incorporated into the general screening and landscaping provisions of Section 17.03.36.
g. Lighting: Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking spaces shall be shaded so that direct light is not cast upon property located in a residential district and so that glare is not a problem to traffic on any public street.
h. Repair and service: No motor vehicle repair work or service of any kind shall be permitted in association with any off-street parking spaces or structures, except as incidental repairs to a personal vehicle. (See Section 17.02.09 for definition of SALVAGE YARD.)
i. Computation: When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by these regulations results in a requirement of a fractional space, the fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded, and a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.
j. Collective provisions: Off-street parking facilities for separate uses may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so furnished is not less than the sum of the separate requirements for each such use; provided, that wherever there is a common plan of parking for land in single ownership that the amount of required parking shall consider the joint use of such space whenever large places of assembly are present which vary in their times of use and season of the year to the end that all parking is contained on the site or on accessory parking lots except for infrequent periods of peak use. The off-street parking spaces required by Section 17.05.02 may be increased; however, where it is anticipated that peak parking periods will be a consistently reoccurring problem. All regulations must be adhered to which cover the location of accessory parking spaces in relation to the use served.
k. Location: All parking spaces required to serve structures or uses shall be
Off-Street Parking and Loading Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 81
located on the same zoning lot as the structure or use served unless a conditional use permit is obtained under Section 17.05.03.
l. Employee parking: Parking spaces required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees on duty or residing, or both, on the premises at any one time.
m. Handicapped parking: Parking spaces according to the number of spaces and their designated signage shall be provided for persons with a disability in conformance to the standards of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as incorporated into state statutes. (See K.S.A. 8-1,128 and 42 USCA 12101 et seq.)
6. Plans and approval required: Plans showing the layout and design of all off-street parking spaces and loading areas, whether required spaces or not, shall be submitted and approved by the Zoning Administrator prior to issuance of a zoning permit for the parking lot itself or as part of an application for a larger related project. Before approving any parking layout, the Zoning Administrator shall determine that the spaces provided are usable and meet standard design criteria as well as all parking requirements of these regulations. Parking spaces shall be clearly indicated or otherwise marked to designate the individual spaces.

E. Home Occupation Authorization by Conditional Use. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these regulations and, in particular, Section 17.06.03.A through D, an application may be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a conditional use as an exception to allow a home occupation in an agricultural or suburban residential district which would permit a broader range of home occupations and less restrictions than otherwise required, so long as in the opinion of the Board under stated conditions that the effect upon adjacent areas is minimized to the extent feasible and the public interest served. The intent of such a provision is to provide for a wider range of home occupational activities while at the same time protecting adjacent properties from the intrusion of incompatible uses and uses of too great an intensity.

CHAPTER 17.07: SIGNS (Updated April 18, 2019)
17.07.01 Purpose. The primary purpose and intent of this Code is to establish a comprehensive system to regulate signage in a legal and reasonable manner that promotes economic vitality, public safety, and ensures compliance with constitutionally protected First Amendment rights. The Code seeks to reduce subjectivity often encountered in the regulation of signage that is either based on aesthetics or lacking in substantiation by providing a set of quantitative and researched-based criteria to support restriction on signage that take into account minimum scientific requirements for providing signage that meets generally accepted safety standards for visibility, legibility and conspicuity. These regulations balance the need to protect the public safety and welfare, the need for a well maintained and attractive community, and the need for adequate identification, communication and advertising. The regulations for signage have the following specific objectives:
A. To ensure that signs are designed, constructed, installed and maintained according to minimum standards to safeguard life, health, property, and public welfare;
B. To allow and promote positive conditions for sign communication;
C. To reflect and support the desired ambience and development patterns of the various zones, overlay zones, and plan districts and promote an attractive environment;
D. To allow for adequate and effective signs whose dimensional characteristics further the interests of public safety and the needs of the motorist, where signs are viewed from a street or roadway; and
E. To ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed right of free expression is protected.
All legally established signs existing at the time of adoption of this code, and all signs displayed hereafter, which are located on property within the corporate limits of the City of Valley Center (“City”), now or hereafter established, shall be subject to the provisions of this code.
17.07.02 General Provisions
A. Message Neutrality. This sign Code is created to establish a framework for a comprehensive and balanced system of content and viewpoint neutral regulation of Signs to facilitate communication between people while protecting the First Amendment rights of individuals and businesses and preserving and improving the quality of the city’s environment by avoiding visual cluster harmful to traffic and pedestrian safety, property values, business opportunities and community appearance. It is the City’s policy to regulate signs in a constitutional manner, which is content neutral as to noncommercial signs and viewpoint neutral as to commercial signs. To the extent that any provisions of these regulations are content-based, they are intended to further compelling governmental interests, including but not limited to:
1. To allow the City and other governmental entities and utilities to erect or post traffic signs, signals, directional signs, and other warnings to protect vehicular and pedestrians without being subject to regulation, and/or
2. To allow property owners to post public interest signs to protect the safety of others, such as “no trespassing”, “home security system”, “roofer at work on property”, “neighborhood watch”, or “beware of dog”, and those legal notices required by court order or directive, all without being subject to regulation.
B. Regulatory and Administrative Interpretations. Interpretations of this Sign Code are to be made initially by the Zoning Administrator. All interpretations of this Code are
Signs Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 93
to be exercised in light of message neutrality and message substitution policies. Where a particular type of sign is proposed, and the type is neither expressly allowed nor prohibited by this Sign Code, or when a sign does not qualify as a “structure” as defined in the building code as adopted by the City, then the Zoning Administrator, as applicable, shall approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the application based on the most similar sign type, using physical and structural similarity, that is expressly regulated by this Sign Code, in light of the policies stated in this Sign Code.
C. Message Substitutions. Subject to the private property owner’s consent, a Constitutionally protected noncommercial message of any category or content may be substituted, in whole or in part, for any allowed commercial message or any other protected noncommercial message, provided that the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any favoring of commercial speech over non-commercial speech, or favoring of any particular protected noncommercial message over any other protected noncommercial message. Message substitution is a continuing right which may be exercised any number of times. The substitution right applies to the sign owner and to any other message sponsor displaying any image on the sign with the owner’s consent.
D. Rules for Non-Communicative Aspects of Signs. All rules and regulations concerning the non-communicative aspects of signs, such as location, size, height, illumination, spacing, orientation, etc., shall be enforceable independently of any permit or approval process.
E. On-Site/Off-Site Distinction. Within this Code, the distinction between on-site (or on premise point-of-sale) and off-site (or off-premise non-point-of-sale) applies only to commercial speech messages.
F. Owner Consent. No sign may be displayed on real or tangible personal property without the consent of the legal owner of the property on which the sign is mounted or displayed.
G. Sign Rights and Duties. All of the rights, duties and obligations relating to all sign structures which are attached to real property, real or personal, and arising from this Code, attach to and travel with the land or other property on which that sign is mounted or displayed.
H. Safety Codes. In addition to the requirements of this Code, all signs displayed in the City must comply with all requirements for public safety including all applicable safety codes, such as, but not limited to, building, plumbing, electrical, mechanical, and fire codes. No sign may be illuminated via an extension cord providing electric power from a source separate from the sign structure.
I. Other Law. All signs displayed in the City must comply with the requirements of this Code and the requirements of all other applicable law.
J. Obscene Matter. It shall be unlawful for any person to display upon any sign or other advertising structure or work of art any material (words, scenes or graphics) that are
Valley Center Zoning Ordinance Signs
94 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
obscene, indecent, immoral or harmful to minors as defined within the meaning of K.S.A. 21-6401, as amended.
K. Permit Requirement. It is illegal to display any sign within the limits of the City without a sign permit, unless the particular sign is expressly exempted from the permit requirement by a section of this Code.
L. Severance. If any section, sentence, clause, phrase, word, portion or provision of this Code is held invalid or, unconstitutional, or unenforceable, by any court of competent jurisdiction, that holding shall not affect, impair or invalidate any other section, sentence, clause, phrase, word, portion or provision of this Code and shall be given effect without the invalid portion. In adopting this Code, the Governing Body affirmatively declares that it would have approved and adopted the Code even without any portion that may be held invalid or unenforceable.
M. Indemnification. The City of Valley Center, its officers, agents, and employees shall be held harmless against any and all claims resulting from the erection, alteration, relocation, construction, or maintenance of any signs legally allowed or permitted by this Sign Code.

Nonconforming Lots, Structures and Uses Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 105
CHAPTER 17.08.00: NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES & USES
17.08.01 Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to (1) provide for the regulation of nonconforming lots, buildings, structures and uses; and (2) specify those circumstances and conditions under which such nonconformities shall be permitted to continue. The right to continue a nonconforming lot, building, structure or use shall not be affected by a change in ownership or operator of the structure or use unless such ownership or operator is a condition attached to an approval for a special or conditional use. Definitions of such nonconformities are as follow: (See Section 17.08.08 for Registration of Nonconformities and Exemptions.)
A. Nonconforming Lot of Record. A zoning lot which is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the creation of a lot of such size and width at such location would not have been prohibited by any zoning regulations and such lot now neither complies with the lot area requirements or the width for any permitted uses in the zoning district in which it is located.
B. Nonconforming Structure. An existing building or structure which does not comply with the maximum lot coverage and height or the minimum yard requirements which are applicable to new structures in the zoning district in which it is located.
C. Nonconforming Use. An existing use of a structure or land which does not comply with the use regulations applicable to new uses in the zoning district in which it is located.
D. Nonconformity. A nonconforming lot, use or structure that does not comply with currently applicable regulations, but that complied with zoning regulations in effect at the time it was legally established. (See Sections 17.08.01.A, B and C.)
17.08.02 Nonconforming Lots of Record.
A. In Any Residential District.
1. Notwithstanding the regulations imposed by any other provision of these regulations, a single-family detached dwelling or any type of manufactured or mobile home which is a permitted use and complies with the restrictions in 17.08.02.A2 may be located on a lot(s) in the same ownership that is not less than 50 feet in width with public water supply and sewerage and that consists entirely of a tract of land that:
a. Has less than the prescribed minimum lot area, width or depth, or all three; and
b. Is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the creation of a lot of such size and width at such location would not have been prohibited by any zoning regulations.
2. Construction permitted by Section 17.08.02.A1 shall comply with all of the regulations except lot area, width and depth applicable to a single-family detached dwelling or any type of manufactured or mobile home in the zoning district in which the lot in question is located; provided, however, that the following side yard requirements shall apply in place of the side yard requirements otherwise applicable:
a. The structure shall be placed on the lot so as to provide a yard on each side of the dwelling.
b. The sum of the widths of the two side yards on each lot shall be not less than the smaller of:
1) 20% of the width of the lot, or
2) The minimum total for both side yards prescribed by the bulk regulations for the zoning district.
Valley Center Zoning Ordinance Nonconforming Lots, Structures and Uses
106 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
c. In any case, neither side yard resulting from the methods permitted in Section 17.08.02.A.2b shall be less than five feet wide.
d. When a yard is also considered to be a front yard on a corner lot, one of the front yards comprising part of the lot width may be reduced to 15 feet; provided, that a driveway to a parking space must maintain a length of at least 20 feet from the front lot line.
B. In Districts Other than Residential Districts:
1. Notwithstanding the regulations imposed by any other provision of these regulations, a structure designed for any permitted use may be erected on a lot of the type described in Section 17.08.02.A1.
2. Construction permitted by Section 17.08.02.B1 shall comply with all of the regulations except minimum lot area, width and depth applicable in the zoning district in which the lot in question is located; provided, that the width of any side yard must not be less than that derived by applying the following formula (wherein the width of any side yard required = w):
Actual lot width X Minimum side yard required by district regulations
w = ---------------------------------------------------
Minimum lot width required by district regulations
17.08.03 Nonconforming Structures.
A. Authority to Continue. Any structure which is devoted to a use which is permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, but which is located on a lot which does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements and/or the applicable bulk regulations, may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions in Sections 17.08.03.B through 17.08.03.D.
B. Enlargement, Repair or Alterations. Any such structure described in Section 17.08.03.A may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or structurally altered; provided, however, that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair or alteration shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity of all or any part of such structure, except that as to structures located on a lot that does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements, the side yard requirements shall be determined by Sections 17.08.02.A2 or 17.08.02.B2, whichever is applicable.
C. Damage. In the event that any structure described in Section 17.08.03.A is damaged, by any means except flooding, to the extent of more than 50% of its fair market value, such structure shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located; provided, that structures located on a lot that does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements shall not in any event be required to provide a side yard that exceeds the yard requirements in Sections 17.08.02.A2 or B2, whichever is applicable. When a structure is damaged to the extent of 50% or less of its fair market value, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a zoning permit is obtained and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial destruction and is diligently pursued to completion. If the applicant is aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Administrator in approving the percent of damage to the value of the structure based on data submitted by the applicant, an appeal may be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a determination. (See Section
Nonconforming Lots, Structures and Uses Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 107
17.08.06 for Nonconforming Nonresidential Structures and Uses)
D. Moving. No structure described in Section 17.08.03.A shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being moved. (See Section 17.03.28 for Moving Structures.)
17.08.04 Nonconforming Uses.
A. Authority to Continue. Any lawfully existing nonconforming use of part or all of a structure or any lawfully existing nonconforming use of land, not involving a structure or only involving a structure which is accessory to such use of land, may be continued, so long as otherwise lawful, subject to the regulations contained in Sections 17.08.04.B through 17.08.04.J.
B. Ordinary Repair and Maintenance.
1. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may be performed on any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use; provided, however, that this subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of Sections 17.08.04.C through I of these regulations.
2. Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of a structure in accordance with an order of a public official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition provided that such restoration will not be in violation of Section 17.08.04.F of these regulations.
C. Structural Alteration. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be structurally altered unless the entire structure and use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
D. Extension.
1. Extension of a nonconforming use is permitted within a nonconforming structure to any portion of the floor area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations or on the effective date of the original City Zoning Regulations or a subsequent amendment heretofore that caused such use to become nonconforming; provided, however, that no structural alterations shall be made unless such changes, and the use thereof, conform to the regulations of the district in which the structure is located.
2. Extension of a nonconforming use of a part of a structure is not permitted if all or substantially all of the structure is designed or intended for a use which is permitted in the district in which the structure is located, nor shall the use be changed to any other nonconforming use.
3. Extension of a nonconforming use is not permitted to any structure or land area other than the one actually occupied or used by such nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations or on the effective date of the original City Zoning Regulations or a subsequent amendment heretofore that caused such use to become nonconforming.
Valley Center Zoning Ordinance Nonconforming Lots, Structures and Uses
108 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
E. Enlargement. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.
F. Damage. In the event that any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is damaged, by any means except flooding, to the extent of more than 50% of its fair market value, such structure shall not be restored unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. When such damage is 50% or less of the fair market value, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a zoning permit is obtained, and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial damage and is diligently pursued to completion. If the applicant is aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Administrator in approving the percent of damage to the value of the structure based on data submitted by the applicant, an appeal may be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a determination. (See Section 17.08.06 for Nonconforming Nonresidential Structures and Uses.
G. Moving. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved. No nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless such use shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved. (See Section 17.03.28 for Moving Structures.).
H. Change in Use. If no structural alterations are made other than those necessary to repair or maintain the structure as described in Section 17.08.04.B1, a nonconforming use of a structure may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or of a similar type of use or more restrictive use. Similarly, a nonconforming use of land not involving a structure or involving only an accessory structure may also be changed. When a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restrictive use or to any permitted use, it shall not thereafter be changed back to a less restrictive use or to a nonconforming use. In determining whether a change in use is the same, similar or more restrictive, the Zoning Administrator shall consider the changes in environmental factors such as outdoor storage, loading, traffic, parking, noise, lighting, air pollution, hours of operation, screening and other factors, as well as the provisions available in Section 17.08.06. (See Section 17.09.02.A for Zoning Permits and Section 17.09.02.B for Occupancy Certificates.).
I. Abandonment.
1. When a nonconforming use of land, not involving a structure, or involving only a structure which is accessory to the nonconforming use of land, is abandoned for a period of six consecutive months, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such land shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such land is located.
2. When a nonconforming use of a part or all of a structure which was designed and intended for any use which is permitted in the zoning district in which such structure is located, is abandoned for a period of 12 consecutive months, such use shall not
Nonconforming Lots, Structures and Uses Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 109
thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such structure shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such structure is located.
3. When a nonconforming use of a part or all of a structure which was not designed and intended for any use which is permitted in the zoning district in which such structure is located, is abandoned for a period of 12 consecutive months, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such structure shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such structure is located.
J. Nonconforming Accessory Uses. No use which is accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue after such principal use shall cease or terminate.
17.08.05 Nonconforming Residential Structures. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 17.08.04.C, D and E, any structure which is devoted to a residential use and which is located in a business or industrial district, may be structurally altered, extended, expanded and enlarged; provided, that after any such alteration, extension, expansion or enlargement, such structure shall not be used to accommodate a greater number of dwelling or lodging units than such structure accommodated prior to any such work unless specifically permitted by the district.
17.08.06 Nonconforming Nonresidential Structures and Uses. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these regulations and, in particular, Sections 17.09.03.B and C and 17.09.04.C, D, E and F, nonconforming nonresidential structures and uses that existed on the day prior to the effective date of these regulations, may apply on a one time basis only to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a conditional use to structurally alter, enlarge or reconstruct after damage, or make extensions to structures or uses including the use of additional land when properly zoned for the use, so long as in the opinion of the Board under stated conditions that the effect upon adjacent areas is protected to the extent feasible and the public interest served. (See Section 17.10.08.C6 for Authorized Variances.)
17.08.07 Status of Existing Conditional and Special Uses and Exceptions.
A. The following procedures are to be followed to determine the status of existing conditional and special uses and exceptions after their reclassification as lawful, permitted, special or conditional uses in these regulations to avoid nonconformities and to provide equitable conversions of such uses:
1. Where a use existed prior to the effective date of these regulations and was previously permitted only as a conditional or special use or as an exception approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals, such uses shall not be deemed to be nonconforming, but shall, without further action, be deemed to be a lawful special or conditional use as now classified with the same conditions applicable as originally established, unless reclassified now as a permitted use.
2. Where a use existed prior to the effective date of these regulations and any prior regulations and was or is now classified as a special use or as a conditional use, it shall be considered to be a lawful, conforming special or conditional use. Enlargement, extension or alterations to existing structures or land improvements for expansion of such lawful uses may be made within the area of the zoning lot which was actually used for such uses on the effective date of these regulations and shall be subject to all requirements set forth in these regulations as a permitted use.

17.08.08 Registration of Nonconformities and Exemptions. (See Sections 17.08.01 for Nonconformities and 17.03.01 for Exemptions.)
A. Purpose. Registration of nonconformities and exemptions, among other purposes, is to provide a property owner with a record of their nonconformity or exemption which may be in effect for many years. Such a record is very desirable since most nonconformities or exemptions are established in the past and the availability of personal witnesses and written documentation to confirm their status becomes more difficult due to the passage of time. This is particularly important since the person claiming the nonconformity or exemption has the burden to prove their claim by the preponderance of the evidence. Registration can be especially useful to property owners who may have a nonconformity or exemption created by changing their zoning status from the unincorporated area of Sedgwick County to the City Zoning Regulations.
B. Rights Conditioned. A lawfully established nonconformity including exemptions is a vested right protected by due process which is sometimes referred to as being 'grandfathered-in'. In order to establish such a right, it is essential that it be created or commenced prior to the enactment of the regulations which restricted its establishment. A nonconformity or exemption which violated the zoning regulations at its inception has no lawful right to continue. Once the validity of the nonconformity or exemption has been determined, it has the right to be sold, inherited, transferred or assigned unless restricted by a condition attached to a special or conditional use. Certain limitations, however, may be placed on the expansion, repair, maintenance and continuance of such nonconformities or exemption as may be determined by the provisions of Chapter 17.08 in these regulations. For example, continuance may be subjected to abandonment or limited amortization of certain uses.
C. Registration Process. The Zoning Administrator shall establish a process for registration of nonconformities and exemptions and a system for making determinations thereof and keeping records of the same. While there shall be no deadline for registration, property owners anticipating the need for registration should do so at their earliest convenience.
D. Registration Determination. The Zoning Administrator shall determine the qualifications of the lot, use or structure for registration as to its legal, nonconforming status. Such determination in writing shall be based on the evidence submitted by the property owner requesting the registration.
E. Appeal. An aggrieved party may appeal the Zoning Administrator’s determination whether to register or not register the nonconformity or exemption to the Board of Zoning Appeals. (See Section 17.10.07 pertaining to Appeals.)

A. Zoning Permits.
1. Unless a zoning permit shall first have been obtained from the Zoning Administrator, the construction, reconstruction, moving or structural alteration of any building or structure or the improvement of land prior to its use or the use of any land or structure being changed to any other use, shall not be commenced. For permits required on accessory uses, temporary uses, home occupations, plans for parking and loading space and signs, see Sections 17.05, 17.06 and 17.07. Such permits shall not be issued by any other official, employee, department, board or agency of the City, except as provided for as a temporary permit in Section 17.06.02. Any zoning permit issued in conflict with the provisions of these regulations shall be null and void. (See Section 17.08.04H for Change in Use.)
2. Except for a continuation of an existing use or occupancy, accessory structures or uses, or additions to existing structures or uses, permits must also meet the requirements of the City Subdivision regulations and, thus, shall not be issued on land which is not shown on a recorded plat or replat, or a lot split or exempted from the platting requirements. If platting or replatting is not required, all of the public improvements necessary to carry out the requested permit nevertheless may be required, including dedications in lieu of platting for easements and to widen right-of-way.
*The City may issue zoning permits and occupancy certificates concurrently with the process of issuing building and occupancy permits under City building codes.
3. No principal or accessory building or structure or use, or portion thereof, shall be permitted to locate on or project over any platted or recorded public easement or over any known utility installation, unless (1) as a sign permitted by Section 17.07.03.K or (2) as an accessory structure or use which is moveable, relocatable or poses no significant problem to the maintenance of existing public improvement installations or to such future installations. Ground level extensions such as concrete slabs or other permanent-type materials are not permitted in or on a public easement except as extensions of parking spaces, driveways or sidewalks for which a zoning permit has been or is being issued. In any event, when such structures or uses are permitted to be located on or project over such easements, the property owner assumes the risk and liability for any reconstruction or replacement necessary including fences if any maintenance or other improvements are required by the City or a utility provider.
4. A zoning permit is not initially required for grading and/or excavating a proposed construction site unless it exceeds one acre or the site is located in the Flood Plain and would result in an increase in flood levels. (See Floodplain Regulations in Article 18.) Any grading or excavating over one acre also will be required to file for a Notice of Intent (NOI) with the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and
Board of Zoning Appeals Valley Center Zoning Ordinance

a. A drawing or copy of the recorded plat, in duplicate, of the piece or parcel of land, lot(s), block(s), parts or portions thereof, drawn to scale showing the actual dimensions of the zoning lot(s), including any easements thereon.
b. A drawing, in duplicate, drawn as a plot plan to scale and in such form as may, from time to time, be prescribed by the Zoning Administrator, showing the location, ground area, height and bulk of (1) all present and proposed structures, (2) drives, parking spaces and loading areas, (3) building setback lines in relation to lot lines, (4) waste disposal areas, (5) use to be made of such present and proposed structures on the land, and (6) other information as may be required for the proper administration of these regulations such as a drawing to indicate the height, gross surface area(s) and lighting of a sign to accompany the required drawing otherwise described in this subsection.
*One copy of such drawings shall be retained by the Zoning Administrator as a public record.
6. Issuance. A zoning permit shall be either issued or disapproved by the Zoning Administrator within 10 days after the receipt of an application thereof or within such further period as may be agreed to by the applicant. When the Zoning Administrator refuses to issue a zoning permit, he shall advise the applicant in writing of the reasons or the disapproval.
7. Period of Validity. A zoning permit shall become null and void 180 days after the date on which it is issued, unless within said period construction, reconstruction, moving or structural alteration of a structure is commenced or a use is commenced. If the construction or work is abandoned or suspended for any 180-day period after such a permit is issued, then application must be made to the Zoning Administrator for an extension of time to continue the project. The Zoning Administrator may grant reasonable extensions of time provided no changes have been made in any applicable regulations. If such changes have occurred, application must be made for a new permit based on the provisions of the new or amended regulations in order to continue the project, unless Section 17.02.07 applies pertaining to vesting of single-family residential developments. (See Section 17.02.06 for Effect of Existing Permits.)
B. Occupancy Certificates. No structure or addition thereto constructed, reconstructed, moved or altered after the effective date of these regulations shall be occupied or used for any purpose; and no land vacant on the effective date of these regulations shall be used for any purpose; and no use of any land or structure shall be changed to any other use, unless an occupancy certificate shall first have been obtained from the Zoning Administrator certifying that the proposed use or occupancy complies with all the provisions of these regulations. (See Section 17.08.04.H for Change in Use.)
1. Application. Every application for a zoning permit shall be deemed to be an application for an occupancy certificate. Every occupancy certificate shall be in such form and contain such information as the Administrator shall provide by general rule.
2. Issuance.
a. No occupancy certificate for a structure or addition thereto constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered or for the new or changed use of any structure or land shall be issued after the effective date of these regulations until such work has been completed and the premises inspected and certified by the Zoning Administrator to be in full and complete compliance with the plans and
Valley Center Zoning Ordinance Board of Zoning Appeals
114 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
specifications upon which the zoning permit was issued including the requirements for utilities, streets and other public improvements in the City Subdivision Regulations which must either be installed or guaranteed. Direct access must be available from the frontage of each zoning lot to an opened public street or otherwise the improvement of the street must be guaranteed by such methods as stated in the Subdivision Regulations.
b. An occupancy certificate shall be issued or written notice shall be given to the applicant stating the reasons why a certificate cannot be issued within 10 days after the receipt of an application therefore or after the Zoning Administrator is notified in writing that the structures or premises are ready for occupancy or use.
c. Pending the issuance of a permanent occupancy certificate, a temporary occupancy certificate may be issued to be valid for a period not to exceed six months from its date, when extenuating circumstances not under the control of the owner occur. The owner may request that a temporary occupancy permit be issued. Such circumstances may include, but not limited to, extreme weather conditions preventing completion of on-site improvements, delay of installation or incomplete public improvements that could possibly cause damage or removal of on-site improvements, or other similar circumstances that could be deemed to interfere with the completion of all required improvements. A request for a temporary occupancy permit shall be accompanied by a performance guarantee and a schedule for completion of all required improvements to the site.
d. A written grant of right of entry on the premises shall be executed by the owner at the time of and in conjunction with the filing of the performance guarantee. The performance guarantee may consist of a performance bond or escrow accounts in the amount equal to estimated costs of improvements to be guaranteed, as evidence by bona fide bids or contracts, and may include contingency factors for inflation and cost overruns in an amount equal to 25% more than the estimated cost.
e. If the required improvements shall not have been installed in accordance with the performance guarantee, the obligator and surety, if any, shall be liable thereon to the City for the cost of the improvements not installed. In addition to all equitable remedies to enforce such guarantee, the proceeds of the security or guarantee may be claimed and used by the City to secure completion of the improvements.

D. Standards.
1. The Board may grant a variance upon specific written findings of fact based upon the particular evidence presented to it at the hearing that all the conditions required by K.S.A. 12-759(e) have been met which are listed below:
a. That the variance requested arises from such condition which is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found in the same zoning district, and is not created by an action or actions of the property owner or the applicant.
b. That granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents.
c. That strict application of the provisions of these regulations from which a variance is requested will constitute unnecessary hardship upon the property owner represented in the application.
d. That the variance desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity or general welfare.
e. That granting the variance desired will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of these regulations.
2. In determining whether the evidence supports the conclusions required by Section 17.10.08.D1, the Board shall consider the extent to which the evidence demonstrates that:
a. The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical condition of the specific property involved would result in a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship upon or for the owner, lessee or occupant, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the provisions of these regulations were literally enforced.
b. The request for a variance is not based exclusively upon a desire of the owner, lessee, occupant or applicant to make more money out of the property.
c. The granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the subject property is located.
d. The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion on public streets or roads, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
E. Conditions and Restrictions. In granting a variance, the Board may impose such conditions upon the premises benefitted by the variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards set out in Section 17.10.08.D which would reduce or minimize any potentially injurious effect of such variance upon other property in the neighborhood and to carry out the general purpose and intent of these regulations, including methods for guaranteeing performance such as are provided for in Section 17.10.09.D. Failure to comply with any of the conditions for a variance which are later attached to a zoning permit shall constitute a violation of these regulations. Upon a finding by the Board of such a violation, the resolution granting the variance may be declared null and void.
Board of Zoning Appeals Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 123
F. Decisions and Records. The Board shall render a written decision containing specific findings of fact in the form of a resolution on an application for a variance without unreasonable delay after the close of a hearing, but in all cases within 45 days after the close of the hearing. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain complete records of all actions of the Board with respect to applications for variances in order to properly issue permits.
G. Period of Validity. No variance granted by the Board shall be valid for a period longer than 180 days from the date on which the Board grants the variance, unless within such 180-day period a zoning permit is obtained and the variance requested is started. The Board may grant extensions not exceeding 180 days each, upon written application, without further notice or hearing.
17.10.09 Conditional Uses. The Board may grant as an exception to the provisions of these regulations, the establishment of only those conditional uses that are expressly authorized to be permitted in a particular zoning district or in one or more zoning districts. No such conditional use shall be granted unless it complies with all of the applicable provisions of these regulations.
A. Application. An application for a conditional use shall:
1. be filed with the Zoning Administrator,
2. provide the legal description of the property involved with the conditional use,
3. be accompanied by an ownership list as required by Section 17.10.04 and the filing fee,
4. contain the following information as well as such additional information as may be prescribed by rule of the Board:
a. A statement or diagram showing compliance with any special conditions or requirements imposed upon the particular conditional use by the applicable district regulations or Section 17.10.09.D if applicable;
b. A statement as to why the proposed conditional use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood;
c. A statement as to how the proposed conditional use is to be designed, arranged and operated in order to permit the development and use of neighboring property in accordance with the applicable district regulations; and
d. Present data in support of the standards specified in Section 17.10.09.C.
B. Hearing and Notice. A hearing on the application for such a conditional use as an exception shall be held and notice thereof given as specified under Sections 17.10.04 and 05 and which are consistent with the general procedures and records required by Section 17.10.02.
C. Standards. The Board may grant a conditional use when it makes specific written findings of fact based upon the particular evidence presented to it at the hearing which support conclusions that:
1. The proposed conditional use complies with all applicable regulations, including lot size requirements, bulk regulations, use limitations and performance standards; unless a concurrent application is in process for a variance.
2. The proposed conditional use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood.
3. The location and size of the conditional use, the nature and intensity of the operation involved in or conducted in connection with it, and the location of the site with respect to streets giving access to it are such that the conditional use will not dominate the immediate neighborhood so as to prevent development and use of
Valley Center Zoning Ordinance Board of Zoning Appeals
124 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
neighboring property in accordance with the applicable zoning district regulations. In determining whether the conditional use will so dominate the immediate neighborhood, consideration shall be given to the location, nature, size and height of buildings, structures, walls and fences on the site and the nature and extent of landscaping and screening on the site.
4. Off-street parking and loading areas will be provided in accordance with the standards set forth in Chapter 17.05 of these regulations. Such areas will be screened from adjoining residential uses and located so as to protect such residential uses from injurious effects.
5. Adequate utility, drainage and other such necessary facilities have been installed or will be provided by platting, dedications and/or guarantees.
6. Adequate access roads, entrance and exit drives and/or access control is available or will be provided by platting, dedications and/or guarantees and shall be so designed to prevent traffic hazards and to minimize traffic congestion in public streets and roads.
D. Conditions. In granting a conditional use, the Board may attach such conditions upon the premises and/or the applicant benefitted by the conditional use as may be necessary to comply with the standards set out in Section 17.10.09.C in order to reduce or minimize any potentially injurious affect upon other property in the neighborhood and to carry out the general purpose and intent of these regulations. Such conditions may include, but not be limited to, further restrictions on bulk regulations; time of operation and ownership limitations; screening, landscaping and fencing; provision of utilities, drainage and other public improvements; additional access or access control; off-street parking and loading requirements; and platting, dedications and/or guarantees. In addition to the guarantees referred to below for parking and/or screening, covenants which run with the land or the property to guarantee that conditions will be carried out at a future date may be filed with the County Register of Deeds. Failure to comply with any of the conditions for a conditional use which are later attached to a zoning permit shall constitute a violation of these regulations. Upon a finding by the Board of such a violation, the resolution granting the conditional use may be declared null and void.
E. Securities. In lieu of actual construction of required off-street parking or the initial provisions for screening, the Board may accept, in the name of the City, a corporate surety bond, cashier's check, escrow account or other like security in an amount to be fixed by the Board and conditioned upon actual completion of such improvement within a specified time. Such securities shall be filed with the Clerk. The Governing Body may enforce such securities by all equitable means.
F. Decisions and Records. The Board shall render a written decision containing specific findings of fact in the form of a resolution on an application for a conditional use without unreasonable delay after the close of a hearing, but in all cases within 45 days after the close of the hearing. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain complete records of all actions of the Board with respect to applications for conditional uses in order to properly issue permits.
G. Period of Validity. No conditional use granted by the Board shall be valid for a period longer than 180 days from the date on which the Board grants the conditional use, unless within such period a zoning permit is obtained and the conditional use requested is started.

Amendments and Special Uses Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 125
CHAPTER 17.11: AMENDMENTS
17.11.01 General Provisions for Amendments and Special Uses. These regulations and the districts created under the authority of these regulations may be amended from time to time by the Planning Commission following a public hearing and the approval by the Governing Body. No such amendment shall be adopted except in accordance with the procedures of Chapter 17.11. Special use applications are not amendments, but are processed for the hearings in the same manner. (See Section 17.11.02. for special uses.)
A. Proposal. Amendments or special uses may be proposed: (1) by the Governing Body, (2) by the Planning Commission or (3) upon application by, or on behalf of the owner of the property affected, but only in accordance with the procedure set forth in Section 17.11.02.B. When the Governing Body proposes an amendment or special use, it shall transmit its proposal to the Planning Commission for a public hearing and recommendation thereon. (See Section 17.11.02.D3 for special notice of hearing procedure for Governing Body and Planning Commission applications.)
B. Application. When the owner of the property affected proposes an amendment to any of these regulations or to any zoning district created thereby or applies for a special use, an application shall:
1. be filed with the Zoning Administrator who refers it to the Planning Commission for a hearing,
2. be in such form and contain such information as shall be prescribed from time to time by the Commission, and
3. in all instances contain the following information:
a. The applicant's name, address and telephone number;
b. The precise wording of any proposed amendment to the text of these regulations or the exact description of the special use requested.
c. In the event that the proposed amendment would change the zoning district classification or add a special use to any specific property:
1) The name, address and telephone number of the owner of the property and, if any, the agent representing the owner;
2) The legal description of the property and a general description such as a street address sufficient to identify the property;
3) The present and proposed zoning district classifications and existing uses of the property and structures thereon;
4) The dimensions of the property and the zoning lot area stated in square feet or acres or fractions thereof; and
5) For land inside the city limits, a certified ownership list of the names, addresses and zip codes of the owners of record of real property located within 200 feet of the exterior boundary of the area described in the application both within the city limits and extending outside the city limits when necessary.
6) If such area is located adjacent to but within the city limits, the ownership list, in addition to the 200 feet inside the city limits, shall provide similar information extending to 1,000 feet into the unincorporated area. If such area is located outside the city limits, the ownership list shall extend for 1,000 feet in the unincorporated area and, if the latter extends into the city limits, then such owners for 200 feet inside the city must also be included on the list.
Valley Center Zoning Ordinance Amendments and Special Uses
126 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
C. Public Hearing. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on each proposed amendment that is filed with, referred to, or initiated by the Commission. The Commission shall select a reasonable time and place for such public hearing, and it shall hold such hearing within 45 days from the date on which the proposed amendment is received or initiated. An applicant for an amendment may waive the requirement that such hearing be held within 45 days.
D. Notice of Hearing. One of the following three procedures shall be selected to provide proper notice for a public hearing for any zoning amendment application:
1. Public notice of a hearing by the Planning Commission on a proposed amendment shall be published once in the official newspaper by the Zoning Administrator. At least 20 days shall elapse between the date of such publication and the date set for such hearing. Such notice shall state the date, time and place of the hearing and shall contain a statement regarding the proposed changes in regulations or the zoning classification or zoning district boundaries of any property. If the proposed amendment would change the zoning classification of any specific property or the boundaries of any zoning district, such notice shall contain the legal description or a general description sufficient to identify the property under consideration. If a general description is used, the notice shall include a statement that a complete legal description is available for public inspection and where such description is available.
2. In addition to such publication notice, the Zoning Administrator shall mail a written notice of the hearing containing information similar to the published notice thereof to the applicant and to the owners of record of all real property within the area to be altered or changed and to all owners of record of real property located within 200 feet of the exterior boundary of the area described in the amendment application both within the city limits and extending outside the city limits when necessary. If such area is located adjacent to but within the city limits, the area of notification shall, in addition to the 200 feet inside the city limits, be extended to 1,000 feet in the unincorporated area. For such property, when the distance of such notice extends outside the City and into an adjacent or nearby city limits, such notice shall be given for 200 feet inside the other city limits. If such area is located outside the city limits, the area of notification shall extend for 1,000 feet and, if such notification extends into the city limits, then 200 feet inside the city limits must also be included. The notice to property owners including the applicant shall be mailed so that 20 days shall elapse between the mailing date and the hearing date. When the notice has been properly addressed and deposited in the mail, failure of a party to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken by the Commission or the Governing Body.
3. Whenever five or more owners of record of real property owning 10 or more contiguous or noncontiguous lots, tracts or parcels of the same zoning classification initiate a rezoning of their property from a less restrictive to a more restrictive zoning classification, such amendment shall require notice by publication only and hearing in like manner as required by Section 17.11.02.C. Such zoning amendment shall not require written notice and shall not be subject to the protest petition provision of Section 17.11.05.
4. Whenever the Governing Body or the Planning Commission initiates a rezoning from a less restrictive to a more restrictive zoning classification of 10 or more contiguous or noncontiguous lots, tracts or parcels of the same zoning classification having five or more owners of record of real property, such amendment shall require notice by
Amendments and Special Uses Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 127
publication and hearing in like manner as that required by Section 17.11.01C. In addition, written notice shall be required to be mailed to only owners of record of real properties to be rezoned and only such owners shall be eligible to initiate a protest petition under Section 17.11.04.
5. The Commission may give such additional notice to other persons as it may from time to time provide by its rules. Such rules may include requirements for additional notice to be provided for by the posting of signs on the land to be considered in the amendment application.
E. Conduct of Hearing.
1. All hearings that these regulations require the Planning Commission to conduct for amendments to changes in the text of the regulations or the zoning classifications or in district boundaries shall be open public meetings according to K.S.A. 75-4317 et seq., the Open Meetings Act. When a proposed amendment will affect the zoning classification or district boundary of specific property, however, the Commission acts in a quasi-judicial capacity and, thus, may upon proper motion proceed to deliberate in closed session according to K.S.A. 75-4318(a). No binding action can be taken in such a session and all voting must be conducted in an open meeting.
2. Any interested person or party may appear and be heard at the hearing in person, by agent or by attorney.
3. The hearing shall be conducted and a record of the proceedings shall be preserved in such a manner and according to such procedures as the Commission may from time to time prescribe by rule or bylaws which are not in conflict with these regulations or applicable State statutes.
4. The Commission shall keep minutes of the proceedings showing evidence presented at hearings, findings of fact by the Commission, motions made and the vote of each member upon any question or recommendation. If a member is absent, abstains or disqualified, such fact shall be indicated.
5. The Commission may request a report on any proposed amendment from any governmental official or agency, or any other person, firm or corporation. If such a report is made, a copy thereof shall be made available to the applicant and any other interested person prior to or at the public hearing.
6. The Commission may make recommendations on proposed amendments to specific properties which affect only a portion of the land described in the hearing notice or which give all or any part of the land described a zoning classification of lesser change than that set forth in the notice. A recommendation for a zoning classification of lesser change than that set forth in the notice shall not be valid, however, without republication and, where necessary, re-mailing of notices, unless the Commission shall have previously established a table or publication available to the public which designates what zoning classifications are lesser changes authorized within the published zoning classifications. (See Appendix for Table of Comparability for Zoning Districts.)
7. For action on zoning amendments, a quorum of the Commission must be more than one-half of the membership as established by ordinance. A majority vote of the members of the Commission present and voting at the hearing shall be required to recommend approval or disapproval of the amendment to the Governing Body. If the Commission fails to make a recommendation on a rezoning request, the Commission shall be deemed to have made a recommendation of disapproval.
8. A hearing may be adjourned from time to time upon a motion to continue in the future at some stated date, time and place. At the conclusion of a hearing, the
Valley Center Zoning Ordinance Amendments and Special Uses
128 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
Commission shall prepare its findings and the factors on which to base its recommendation and vote.
9. If a meeting is called or a hearing is on the agenda and no quorum is present, the members in attendance may agree to hold the hearing at another meeting in the future at a stated date, time and place or at the next regular meeting for which, when announced at the present scheduled meeting, no further public notice need be given to continue the hearing.
F. Report by Planning Commission. Within 14 days after the close of the public portion of the hearing and voting on a proposed amendment or special use, the Planning Commission shall submit a report to the Governing Body. A copy of this report shall also be filed with the Clerk and the Zoning Administrator and such copies shall be kept available for public inspection. A copy of the report shall also be mailed to the applicant. Such report shall contain a recommendation as to whether the proposed amendment or special use should be approved or disapproved and specific written determinations on the items listed in Sections 17.11.01G or 17.11.01H and on such other items as the Commission may consider relevant. The report submitted to the Governing Body shall be accompanied by a summary of the hearing as required by K.S.A. 12-756(b). In lieu of a report, the above information may be contained in the minutes of the meeting and submitted to the Governing Body.
G. Amendments to Text. When a proposed amendment would result in a change in the text of these regulations, but would not result in a change of zoning classification of any specific property, the report of the Planning Commission shall contain a statement as to the nature and effect of such proposed amendment and determinations as to the following items:
1. Whether such change is consistent with the intent and purposes of these regulations; and
2. Whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of changed or changing conditions in the zoning districts affected and, if so, the nature of such changed or changing conditions.
H. Review Criteria for Amendments or Special Uses. When a proposed amendment would result in a change of the zoning district classification of any specific property, the report of the Planning Commission, accompanied by a summary of the hearing, shall contain statements as to (1) the present and proposed district classifications, (2) the applicant's reasons for seeking such reclassification, and (3) a statement of the factors where relevant upon which the recommendation of the Commission is based using the following factors as guidelines:*
1. What is the character of the subject property and the surrounding neighborhood in relation to existing uses and their condition?
2. What is the current zoning of the subject property and that of the surrounding neighborhood in relationship to the requested change?
3. Is the length of time that the subject property has remained undeveloped or vacant as zoned a factor in the consideration?
4. Would the request correct an error in the application of these regulations?
*NOTE: All the factors stated in the decision of Golden v. City of Overland Park, 224 Kan. 591, 584 P. 2d 130 (1978) are included in this list. In using these factors as guidelines for special uses, modifications may be made in the questions especially to substitute the words "special use" for "change in zoning."
Amendments and Special Uses Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 129
5. Is the request caused by changed or changing conditions in the area of the subject property and, if so, what is the nature and significance of such changed or changing conditions?
6. Do adequate sewage disposal and water supply and all other necessary public facilities including street access exist or can they be provided to serve the uses that would be permitted on the subject property?
7. Would the subject property need to be platted or replatted or in lieu of dedications made for rights-of-way, easements, access control or building setback lines?
8. Would a screening plan be necessary for existing and/or potential uses of the subject property?
9. Is the suitable vacant land or buildings available or not available for development that currently has the same zoning?
10. If the request is for business or industrial uses, are such uses needed to provide more services or employment opportunities?
11. Is the subject property suitable for the uses in the current zoning to which it has been restricted?
12. To what extent would the removal of the restrictions, i.e., the approval of the zoning request detrimentally affect other property in the neighborhood?
13. Would the request be consistent with the purpose of the zoning district classification and the intent and purpose of these regulations?
14. Is the request in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan and does it further enhance the implementation of the Plan?
15. What is the nature of the support or opposition of the request?
16. Is there any information or are there recommendations on this request available from professional persons or persons with related expertise which would be helpful in its evaluation?
17. By comparison, does the relative gain to the public health, safety and general welfare outweigh the loss in value or the hardship imposed upon the applicant by not approving the request?
Of those factors considered as relevant to the requested change in zoning district classification or boundary or special use, not all factors need to be given equal consideration by the Commission in deciding upon its recommendation.
17.11.02 Special Uses.
A. Because of particular factors associated with their activities, certain uses which might have an adverse effect upon nearby properties or upon the character and future development of a district are not permitted outright in districts, but are allowed as "special uses" when their proposed location is supplemented by additional conditions such as to make the use considered compatible with the surrounding property, the neighborhood and the zoning district.
B. In granting a special use, the minimum requirements of approval for all similar types of permitted uses in the same district must be met, unless otherwise reduced by a specific reference in these regulations.
C. The requirements may be made more stringent if there is a potentially injurious effect which may be anticipated upon other property and the neighborhood or contrary to the welfare and convenience of the public. Such additional conditions may include, but are not limited to, requirements affecting the lot size or yard dimensions; changing street width; the extent and location of entrance or exit drives; controlling the size, location and
Valley Center Zoning Ordinance Amendments and Special Uses
130 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
number of signs; the period and time of operation; lot coverage and height of buildings; screening, fencing and/or landscaping to protect the surrounding property; establishing environmental standards for air and water pollution, noise, vibration, lighting and other such conditions; protection from flooding; and additional improvements such as street construction, sidewalks, utilities and storm drainage, if necessary, including platting and/or dedications. Such conditions may be placed upon the property which is the subject of the special use application or upon the applicant or both.
D. Although the official zoning map is not amended, the procedure for approval of a special use shall otherwise be the same as for an amendment to change a zoning district classification or boundary which is set forth in Section 17.11. 01 of this Section including the provisions for filing protest petitions in Section 17.11.04, provided that any additional requirements which are further imposed upon the special use shall be made a part of the effectuating ordinance.
E. Applications for a special use shall be accompanied by a site plan of the proposed development. Concurrent applications may be processed for changing zoning district classifications as amendments and approving special uses on the same property wherein joint notices are advertised and mailed and hearing held; however, separate motions, review criteria and effectuating ordinances are necessary. Concurrent applications may be processed for changing zoning district classifications as amendments and approving special uses on the same property.
17.11.03 Project Review.
A. In the event that certain public improvements, facilities or utilities of a type embraced within the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan are classified as special uses or are the subject of a change in zoning district classification or boundary, the consideration of such uses by the Planning Commission in conjunction with a zoning application may also constitute their project review of such proposed use if concurrently processed under procedures required by K.S.A. 12-748, as amended; provided, that a statement of findings is included in the Commission's approval or disapproval as to whether such proposed use is or is not in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan.
B. In case the Commission finds that the proposed use is not in conformance to the Plan and states in writing the manner in which it is not in conformance, then the Governing Body shall not proceed with construction of such a proposed use unless the Governing Body by a majority vote overrides the disapproval of the Commission and the Plan shall be deemed to have been amended and the Commission shall make the necessary changes in the Plan to reflect the vote of the Governing Body.
17.11.04 Filing of Protest.
A. Whether or not the Planning Commission approves or disapproves a zoning change, if a written protest petition against a proposed amendment for a specific property or a special use shall be filed in the office of the Clerk within 14 days after the date of the conclusion of the hearing by the Commission which is signed and an accurate legal description of their property provided by the owners of record of 20% or more of any real property proposed to be altered or changed, excluding streets or public ways, or by the owners of record of 20% or more of the real property within the total area required in the official area of notification by Section 17.11.01.D, excluding streets and public ways and specific statutorily excluded property as described below; then the effectuating
Amendments and Special Uses Valley Center Zoning Ordinance
Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014 131
ordinance shall not be passed except by at least a 3/4 vote of all the members of the City Council.
B. Property statutorily excluded from determining the sufficiency of a protest petition when calculating the total real property within the notification area is that which was:
1. requested by the owner of the specific property for rezoning or a special use; or
2. the owner of the specific property requested for rezoning or a special use who does not oppose in writing such rezoning or special use. (See Sections 17.11.01.D 2 and D3 for protest petition exceptions for rezoning from a lesser restrictive to a more restrictive zoning classification.)
17.11.05 Adoption of Amendments or Special Uses by the Governing Body.
A. When the Planning Commission in its report submits a recommendation of approval or disapproval of a proposed amendment or special use including the basis therefore, the Governing Body may:
1. Adopt such recommendation by an effectuating ordinance,
2. override the Commission's recommendation by a 2/3 majority vote of the membership of the City Council, or
3. return such recommendation to the Commission with a statement specifying the basis for the Governing Body's failure to approve or disapprove.
B. If the Governing Body returns the Commission's recommendation, the Commission, after considering the same, may resubmit its original recommendation giving the reasons therefore or submit a new or amended recommendation. Upon the receipt of such recommendation, the Governing Body, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendation by the effectuating ordinance or it need take no further action thereon. If the Commission fails to deliver its recommendation to the Governing Body following the Commission's next regular meeting after receipt of the Governing Body's report, the Governing Body shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the Commission as a resubmission of the original recommendation and proceed accordingly.
C. In considering its decision under each of the above set of circumstances, the Governing Body shall take into account the guidelines in Section 17.11.01H which are relevant to the proposed amendment or special use and, having reviewed the Commission's findings of fact and the factors upon which their recommendation is based, the Governing Body either adopts the Commission's findings and factors by reference or records their own findings of fact and the factors upon which their decision is based.
D. The proposed amendment or special use shall become effective upon publication for either of them of the respective adopting ordinance. If such an amendment affects the classification or boundaries of any zoning district, the respective ordinance shall legally describe the classification or boundaries as amended, shall order the Official Zoning Map to be changed to reflect such amendment, and shall reincorporate such map as amended.
17.11.06 Annual Review. In order to maintain these regulations including the Official Zoning Map(s), the Planning Commission shall annually hold a public review at their first regular meeting in January to consider amendments, if any, to these regulations. Preceding such a review, the Governing Body and other affected governmental agencies and interested parties
Valley Center Zoning Ordinance Amendments and Special Uses
132 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
should be notified of the intent to review and their ideas requested. In preparation for such a review, the Zoning Administrator shall maintain a master copy of the current zoning regulations on which are recorded comments and ideas brought to the attention of the Administrator during the preceding year in order to maintain the intent and purpose of these regulations under changing conditions and to implement the Comprehensive Plan. Information on any relevant changes in state statutes shall be compiled for the review.
17.11.07 Judicial Review. As provided by K.S.A. 12-760, as amended, any ordinance, regulation, amendment, special use or other zoning decision provided for or authorized by these regulations shall be reasonable and any person aggrieved thereby may have the reasonableness of any decision determined by bringing an action against the City within 30 days after a final decision is made by the City. In the event that an amendment to these regulations or a special use is approved by the Governing Body, the 30-day period commences when the effectuating ordinance is published. Such action shall be brought in the Sedgwick County District Court.

CHAPTER 17.12.00: SITE PLAN REVIEW
17.12.01 Site Plan Approval Purpose.

Valley Center Zoning Ordinance Appendix: Table of Comparability for Zoning Districts
138 Adopted Zoning Regulations: September 18, 2014
APPENDIX: TABLE OF COMPARABILITY FOR ZONING DISTRICTS
In accordance with provisions provided for in K.S.A. 12-757(b) and in Section 17.11.01.E6 of the Zoning Regulations of the City of Valley Center, Kansas, the Valley Center City Planning Commission hereby establishes a "Table of Comparability for Zoning Districts" as listed below. This table designates the zoning districts which are considered to be "lesser changes" due to their more restrictive characteristics as set forth in the Zoning Regulations.
When considering zoning district amendments, the Planning Commission and the Governing Body may recommend and approve a lesser change in zoning districts for the property already advertised for a public hearing without re-publication of a notice or re-distribution of notices to property owners when such change is more restrictive than the district which is applied for as shown on the table below; provided, however, that such recommendation and approval shall not be for a lesser classification than the existing zoning district. If the applicant at the Governing Body meeting at which a zoning amendment is being considered desires to amend the application and/or the Governing Body desires to consider a "lesser" zoning change, then such a proposed change shall be returned to the Planning Commission for reconsideration and further recommendation to the Governing Body without further publication or notice as provided for in K.S.A. 12-757(c) and in Section 17.11.05 of the Zoning Regulations.
MOST RESTRICTIVE TO LEAST RESTRICTIVE
A-1
Agricultural District
RR-1
Suburban Residential District
R-1A
Single-Family Residential District
R-1B
Single-Family Residential District
R-2
Two-Family Residential District
R-3
Multiple-Family Residential District
C-2
General Business District
I
Industrial District
Because of the uniqueness and special purpose for which the MH-1 Manufactured Home Park, C-1 Central Business, PUD Planned Unit Development, P-O Protective Overlay, and Downtown Overlay districts serve, these districts are excluded from the Table of Comparability.
Although the notification for a "Special Use" is processed in the same manner as a zoning district amendment, it is not an actual change in zoning districts and, therefore, the Table of Comparability does not apply and reapplication is necessary for consideration of a different "Use" even if in the same zone. Part of the property considered for a Special Use, however, may be withdrawn by the applicant or a lesser amount recommended for approval without renotification.
EXAMPLE: If an application is advertised for a public hearing requesting a change from R-1A Single-Family Residential District to I Industrial District, the Planning Commission may recommend the lesser, i.e., more restrictive C-2 Business District without republication or mailing of new notices.
If an application, however, is advertised for a public hearing requesting a change from the existing C-1 Business District to the I-1 Industrial District, the recommending of the lesser R-3 Multiple-Family Residential District shall not be valid without re-publication and the mailing of new notices.

covenant which provides that a homeowners or lot owners association will hold title to the reserve and
therefore be responsible for the reserve's maintenance. The restrictive covenant may provide for
ownership and maintenance to be tied to the ownership of an adjacent lot. Ownership and
maintenance is not assigned to an individual, partnership or corporation except in the case of a reserve

ARTICLE 4. PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY AND FINAL PLATS
100 Submittal of Sketch Plan. The subdivider may, if deemed desirable, submit a sketch plan in order to
receive the pre-plat comments of the Subdivision Committee and/or the Planning Commission which
may prove helpful in designing the preliminary plat. Three copies of the sketch plan should be submitted
to the Subdivision Administrator in a simple format sufficient to convey the location of proposed streets
and utilities, the general layout of lots, and to note any particular design situations which could benefit
from an early discussion of the problems. One copy of the sketch plan shall be returned to the
subdivider with notations marked as to the comments resulting from such a review process. No fee shall
be charged for the sketch plan review.
101 Filing of Preliminary Plat. An application shall be filed with the Subdivision Administrator at least 30
days prior to the next regular meeting of the Planning Commission and such number of copies of the
preliminary plat as may be determined necessary by the Administrator for proper review by affected and
interested governmental and public and private organizations plus a computer disk in AutoCAD that is
compatible with ESRI GIS or comparable software of the plat information and any accompanying
drawings including the drainage plan. Such plat shall not be accepted for filing until the fee as provided
for in Section 3-109 has been paid by the subdivider to the Clerk. The preliminary plat shall contain the
information as set out in Section 5-100 of these regulations. (See Section 2-102 for definition of a
REPLAT under the heading of PLAT.)
102 Distribution and Review of Preliminary Plat. After the filing of the preliminary plat, the Subdivision
Administrator shall distribute copies to affected and interested governmental and public and private
organizations as appropriate. Organizations receiving copies shall have 15 days to review the
preliminary plat and to make their comments and recommendations to the Planning Commission. A lack
of response in 15 days shall, at the discretion of the Planning Commission, signify approval, unless
during this period a written request for an extension of one time only not to exceed 15 days is submitted
to the Planning Commission.
103 Action by the Planning Commission on Preliminary Plat. The Planning Commission shall review the
preliminary plat and consider the comments and recommendations of the organizations to whom the
preliminary plat had been submitted for review. If deemed desirable, the Commission may mail notices
or copies of agendas to interested parties and conduct a public hearing for the purpose of receiving
information supporting or opposing the preliminary plat.
A. The Planning Commission shall determine whether the preliminary plat generally meets the design
standards and requirements of these regulations, the Comprehensive Plan, the applicable zoning
regulations and other applicable provisions of the ordinances of the City.
B. If satisfied, the Planning Commission shall approve the preliminary plat with or without conditions
and so notify the subdivider in writing.
C. If the Planning Commission determines that the preliminary plat does not satisfy the foregoing
conditions, it may suggest modifications so as to satisfy such conditions and in such event:
1. The subdivider may amend the preliminary plat so as to incorporate such modifications and
4-2
resubmit the plat to the Commission, which shall then grant its approval if such amendments
satisfactorily incorporate the suggested modifications; or
2. The subdivider may reject the suggested modifications or, within the time allowed for
Commission action, may refrain from taking any action thereon. In either event, the
preliminary plat shall be deemed to have been disapproved and the Commission shall
thereupon furnish the subdivider with a written statement setting forth the reasons for
disapproval of the preliminary plat.
D. If the Planning Commission determines that the preliminary plat does not satisfy the conditions of
these regulations and that modifications would be too extensive or impractical, it shall disapprove
the preliminary plat and immediately notify the subdivider in writing of its action, all within 60 days.
104 Failure of Planning Commission to Act on Preliminary Plat. If the Planning Commission fails to
approve or disapprove a preliminary plat within 60 days after the date such plat is filed with the
Subdivision Administrator or from the date the subdivider has filed the last item of required data,
whichever date is later, then such preliminary plat shall be deemed to have been approved, unless the
subdivider shall have consented in writing to extend or waive such time limitation.
105 Effect of Approval of Preliminary Plat.
A. Approval of the preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the subdivision by the Planning
Commission, but shall signify in general the acceptability of the proposed subdivision.
B. Such approval shall be considered permission to submit the final plat accompanied by the
information required by Section 5-101R.
C. Such approval shall be effective for no more than 12 months from the date approval was granted,
unless, upon application from the subdivider, the Planning Commission grants an extension of time
beyond such period. If a final plat for the entire subdivision or a unit thereof has not been filed with
the Subdivision Administrator within such period, or any extensions granted thereto, the preliminary
plat must be resubmitted to the Commission as if such plat had never been approved, except that
no additional fee shall be charged for such resubmittal if there are no substantive changes from the
previous preliminary plat approval.
106 Filing of Final Plat. An application for final plat approval, together with a sufficient number of copies as
determined by the Subdivision Administrator for proper review plus a computer disk in AutoCAD that is
compatible with ESRI GIS or comparable software of the plat information and any accompanying
drawings including the drainage plan shall be filed with the Administrator at least 20 days prior to the next
regular meeting of the Planning Commission and within 12 months after the date that the preliminary
plat has been approved. The Administrator shall transmit the final plat to the Commission and to other
affected and interested governmental and public and private organizations as desirable for any further
recommendations. The final plat shall contain the information as set out in Section 5-101 of these
4-3
regulations. (See Section 2-102 for definition of a REPLAT under the heading of PLAT.)
107 Planning Commission Action on the Final Plat. The Planning Commission shall, within 60 days after
the first meeting of the Commission following the date that the plat with all required data is filed with the
Subdivision Administrator, review and approve the final plat by a majority vote of the members present
and voting if:
A. It is substantially the same as the approved preliminary plat; or
B. There has been compliance with all conditions which may have been attached to the approval of
the preliminary plat; and
C. It complies with all of the provisions contained in these regulations and of other applicable
regulations or laws.
108 Failure of Planning Commission to Act on Final Plat. If the Planning Commission fails to approve or
disapprove the final plat within the 60 days designated by state law for its consideration as stated in
Section 4-107, it shall be deemed to have been approved and a certificate shall be issued by the
Secretary upon demand, unless the subdivider shall have consented in writing to extend or waive such
time limitation. (See K.S.A. 12-752[b].)
109 Submittal to Governing Body of Final Plat. Before a final plat is recorded, it shall be submitted to the
Governing Body for its acceptance of dedications for street rights-of-way and other public ways, drainage
and utility easements, and any land dedicated for public use and accompanied by guarantees for the
installation of required improvements according to Section 7-104.
110 Governing Body Action on Final Plat. The Governing Body shall either accept or not accept the
dedication of any land for public purposes by a majority vote within 30 days after the first meeting of the
Governing Body following the date of the submission of the plat to the Clerk. The Governing Body may
defer action for an additional 30 days for the purpose of allowing for modifications to comply with the
requirements established by the Governing Body. If the Governing Body defers action on the plat or
declines to accept the dedications thereto, it shall advise the Planning Commission and the subdivider in
writing of the reasons therefor. Acceptance of the dedications on the plat shall be shown over the
signature of the Mayor and attested to by the Clerk.
111 Acceptance of Dedications by County. All final plats outside the City shall also be submitted by the
subdivider to the appropriate County official for presentation to the Board of County Commissioners for
their acceptance of dedications for street rights-of-way and other public ways, drainage and utility
easements, and any land dedicated for public use and accompanied by guarantees for the installation of
required improvements according to Section 7-104.
112 Recording of Final Plat. The final plat with all required signatures and in the exact form as accepted by
the Governing Body shall be recorded by the subdivider with the County Register of Deeds. The
subdivider shall pay the recording fee and any outstanding real estate taxes and special assessments.
4-4
Approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission and acceptance by the Governing Body shall be
null and void if (1) the plat is not acceptable for recording in the office of the Register of Deeds; or (2) is
not recorded within 60 days after final acceptance by the Governing Body; or (3) is not recorded within
15 days after final acceptance by the applicable County Governing Body under the preconstruction
procedures of Section 7-104C. The subdivider shall submit to the Subdivision Administrator such
number of copies of the recorded plat as is necessary for record keeping purposes of the City and other
affected governmental agencies plus a computer disk of the plat information and any final drawings
accompanying the plat in AutoCAD that is compatible with ESRI GIS or compatible software. (See
Section 5-101R1 for title report and Section 10-100C for Vacation of Unrecorded Plat.)
113 Unit Developments. The foregoing provisions of these regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, an
approved preliminary plat may be submitted for final approval in separate geographic units rather than as
a whole, provided the following conditions are met:
A. Each unit of a plat of subdivision shall contain an area of sufficient size based on physical
conditions and ability to install improvements economically.
B. The approval of the Planning Commission as to the feasibility of such development, in separate
units, including the feasibility of the proposed sequence of development, shall be secured.
C. A final plat of at least one unit shall be filed within 12 months from the date of approval of the
preliminary plat, and final plats of all such units shall be filed within five years from the date that the
preliminary plat was approved. The Planning Commission on application of the subdivider, may,
from time to time, grant extensions of time within which to submit such final plats, provided that
each such extension shall be for no more than one year.
D. All steps required for the approval of final plats, including the recording thereof, shall be adhered to
with respect to each unit so submitted.
E. A replat of all or a portion of a recorded final plat may be submitted at any time.
114 Approval of Plats for Small Tracts.
A. Authorization. Any other provision of these regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, if a
proposed plat of subdivision or resubdivision complies with the requirements of Section 4-114B,
then the Planning Commission may approve a final plat of such subdivision or resubdivision when
neither a sketch plan nor a preliminary plat has been filed by the subdivider and a preliminary plat
has not been approved by the Planning Commission.
B. Requirements. In order to qualify for approval in the manner provided in Section 4-114A, a
proposed plat of subdivision shall comply with the following requirements:
1. The proposed plat of subdivision shall include not more than five acres if a residential plat,
nor more than five acres for any other type of plat, unless approved for a larger acreage by
the Planning Commission.
4-5
2. The proposed plat of subdivision shall create not more than five lots, tracts or parcels of land,
unless approved for a larger number by the Planning Commission.
3. No public street or easement of access, e.g., a utility or drainage easement, is sought to be
dedicated or is contemplated or projected through (as opposed to adjacent to) the lot, tract or
parcel proposed to be subdivided or resubdivided.
4. The proposed plat of subdivision shall be in the form required by Section 5-101 and shall
contain all the data, information and certificates required on final plats as well as the
supplemental information.
5. Submission of the fees as required by Section 3-109.
C. Procedures.
1. Final plats filed for approval pursuant to Section 4-114 shall be filed with the Subdivision
Administrator who may submit such plat for review and recommendations to affected and
interested governmental agencies and public and private utility providers as deemed
desirable. The Administrator may require the subdivider to submit topographic information
whenever the property proposed to be subdivided or resubdivided is traversed by or is
adjacent to a known watercourse, including intermittent streams or is subject to flooding as
defined in Section 6-104.
2. The approval of final plats by the Planning Commission pursuant to Section 4-114 shall be
subject to the same procedural provisions of a final plat, except insofar as the said sections
require prior approval of, or compliance with, an approved preliminary plat.

Whenever the subdivider's agreement and any restrictive covenants are recorded prior to or
concurrently with the final plat, the book and page numbers where they are recorded shall be
noted on the plat for reference purposes.
10. Subdivisions which lie outside the city limits for which requests have been made for the
extension of one or more City utility services shall agree to a waiver of protest of potential
future annexation by a statement reading "Owners of lands within this subdivision do hereby
bind themselves to waive any protest to annexation by the City of Valley Center, Kansas,"
which shall be shown on the final plat and included in restrictive covenants of the subdivision.
When such an agreement is contained in such restrictive covenants and filed by
the City with the County Register of Deeds within 30 days after being executed by all
parties, it shall be deemed to be sufficient consent to annexation under K.S.A. 12-520, as
amended, to bind the owner(s) of the land to be subdivided and any successors in interest.
(See Section 5-101R3 for restrictive covenants.)
5-14
11. Provision for all other certifications, approvals and acceptances which are now, or which
may hereafter be, required by any statute, ordinance or regulation. The form of these
certifications may be modified as necessary by the City's legal counsel to meet statutory or
other requirements.
R. The following additional information shall be submitted with the final plat:
1. A title report by an abstract or a title insurance company, or an attorney's opinion of title,
showing the owner of the land and all other persons who have an interest therein and
describing any encumbrances on the plat, including such items as rights-of-way,
easements, pipelines, leases, mineral rights, mortgages, real estate taxes, special
assessments and other encumbrances affecting the ownership. (See Section 5-101 Q 8 on
payment of real estate taxes and special assessments before recording.)
2. When deemed necessary by the Subdivision Administrator, a final drainage plan based on the
standards and policies set by the City as determined by the designated City Engineer
including a four-corner grading plan for each zoning lot plus minimum pad elevations if
located in a flood prone area. The plat shall also include a statement to the effect that such
drainage plan has been developed for the subdivision including a four-corner lot grading
plan and that all drainage easements, rights-of-way or reserves shall remain at the
established grades and unobstructed to allow for the conveyance of storm water. The
statement shall further note that such plan has been filed with the Subdivision Administrator
at City Hall. Any modifications of the established grades on the drainage plan shall be
prepared by the subdivider's engineer, submitted for approval by the designated City
Engineer and filed with the original drainage plan on file at City Hall.
3. A copy, if any, of restrictive covenants applicable to the subdivision. As a service to the
subdivider, such restrictions may be reviewed by the Planning Commission and other
officials to determine if any potential conflicts exist with the City's laws. If the condition
exists for outside the City utility service as described in Section 5-101 Q 10, then restrictive
covenants must be submitted for review of the annexation waiver provisions.

ARTICLE 6. DESIGN STANDARDS
100 Scope. All subdivision of land subject to these regulations shall conform to the minimum design
standards of this Article according to the classifications of urban and rural type subdivisions as defined
in Article 7-100.
101 Comprehensive Development Plan. Subdivisions shall conform with the intent of the Comprehensive
Plan.
102 Land for Public Facility Sites. Public agencies using the Comprehensive Plan as a guide may use
the following procedure for acquiring sites for public facilities which does not preclude voluntary
dedication and mutual negotiations for land or the use of the condemnation laws of the State: (See
Section 2-102 for definition of RESERVE.)
A. The subdivider offers to sell to the appropriate public body, agency or authority, lands, sites and
locations for parks, recreational areas, schools, fire stations or other public facilities. As soon as
the preliminary plat has been received and reviewed, the Planning Commission shall give 45
days notice to the public body, agency or authority that it appears that lands should be considered
for public acquisition. If within that 45 days the body receiving notice fails to act or submits a
negative report on acquisition, then the subdivision and design thereof shall be treated as if no
such request for land had been made.
B. If the organization receiving notice replies in writing that they desire to acquire land within the
subdivision, they shall have an additional 45 days after making such reply to make arrangements
for such land acquisition.
C. The time allocated for making the above determination may be extended with the mutual consent
of the subdivider and the organization involved.
103 Land for Open Space. The following conditions may be required as part of the approval of any
subdivision plat: (See Section 2-102 for definition of RESERVE and WETLAND.)
A. That the subdivider provide appropriate dedication of land or easements for the preservation of
open space areas within a subdivision. Such open space may be needed to preserve areas
containing natural watercourses, drainage ways, areas subject to periodic flooding, wetlands,
substantial woodland, rugged topography and wildlife habitat; to maintain water quality and quantity;
and to protect land from soil erosion. In general, such land is not normally considered as
buildable land and should not be developed in order to maintain the quality of the environment.
6-2
104 Land Subject to Flooding.
A. Whenever a subdivision of land including platting for manufactured home parks and other
developments on one-lot plats is located on flood prone land identified on a Flood Insurance Rate
Map(s) (F.I.R.M.) prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the following
requirements shall apply: (See City Zoning Regulations for flood plain districts.) (See Section
5-101 O for minimum pad elevations.)
1. Show on the preliminary and final plats the boundary lines and elevations for both floodway, if
any, and 100-year flood level; and
2. Assure that (a) all such subdivisions are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage,
(b) all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, water, gas and electrical systems are
located, elevated and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and (c) adequate
drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
105 Land Subject to Excessive Erosion by Wind or Water. On land subject to excessive soil movement
by the forces of wind and/or water and that may cause environmental health hazards, necessary
preventive measures shall be a part of the subdivision plat. Conservation standards applicable to subdivisions
shall be adhered to which are used by the Sedgwick County Conservation District.
106 Access. All lots located in any subdivision must contain at least 35 feet of frontage in the City and at
least 60 feet outside the City for driveways directly connected to an opened public street other than an
alley and not across the land of others. Flag lots are not permitted, unless warranted by an unusual
shape of the land or the ownership of property. (See Section 2-102 for definition of FLAG LOT.)
107 Streets-Layout and Design.
A. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the
intent of the Comprehensive Plan, and shall be considered in their relation to existing and
planned streets, to reasonable circulation of traffic within the subdivision and adjoining lands; to
topographical conditions, to the run-off of storm water; to public convenience and safety; and in
their appropriate relations to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
B. Where such is not shown on a Comprehensive Plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision
shall either:
1. Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets in surrounding areas;
or
6-3
2. Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the Planning Commission to
meet a particular situation where topographic or other conditions make continuance or
conformance to existing streets impracticable.
C. Local streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
D. If a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed limited access highway, arterial street or
railroad right-of-way, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse
frontage lots with access control provisions along the rear property line and screening, deep lots
with rear service alleys or such other design as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential
properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
E. Reserve strips controlling access of streets shall be prohibited except where their control is
placed with the applicable Governing Body under acceptable conditions.
F. Street right-of-way requirements for other than arterials shall be determined by the total
aggregate needs for the functional components for the particular system being considered. The
total aggregates shall be in increments of even feet, even numbers only. The components
involved shall be as follows depending upon the urban or rural type of characteristics of the street
needed based on land use, traffic and density:
1. Moving or traffic lanes may be variable from nine to 12 feet depending on function, e.g., low
density residential, cul-de-sac residential, collector, industrial, etc., and on design speed of
the roadway. A moving lane may utilize a portion of the surface of certain types of curb
construction.
2. Parking lanes for on-street storage of vehicles shall be at least eight feet in width. For
computation purposes, up to two feet for curb or shoulder may be included as part of the
parking lane.
3. Curbs shall be considered to require two feet irrespective of construction type.
4. Shoulders for rural type roadways shall be not less than three feet in width.
5. Parking strips for streets shall be at least 14 1/2 feet in width from the back of curb to the
right-of-way line. This area shall be used for the installation of utilities, street signs, street
lights, traffic control devices, fire hydrants, sidewalks, driveways, street furniture, street trees
from an approved City list and to provide a transition area in grades, if necessary, between
the roadway and the property adjacent to the right-of-way. Border strips for rural type roads
shall be variable in width based on drainage needs.
6-4
6. Based on the above general criteria, street rights-of-way and roadways shall be calculated
from the following guidelines:
R-O-W for Roadway
Street Width
In feet* In feet
URBAN AREA
a. Collector including Commercial,
Industrial or Multiple-Family 70 40**
Areas.
b. Local Residential including
Cul-de-sacs and Single and 64 30-34**
Two-Family Areas.
c. Local Marginal Access Street
(two moving lanes with no
parking on one side plus a 50 24-28**
parking strip between curb
and the main road right-of-way).
d. Alleys for Residential, if
necessary, and Commercial 20 20
Areas.
-----------------
** Face of curb to face of curb.
RURAL AREA
a. Collector including Industrial
or Commercial Areas (Two moving
lanes, six-foot shoulders, 80 47
ditches and borders.)
b. Local Residential (Two moving
lanes, three-foot shoulders, 70 31
ditches and borders.)
-----------------
These widths may be modified by the Planning Commission on a showing that special
conditions exist such as drainage and utility requirements, safe and efficient traffic and
pedestrian movement, intersection design, etc. In applying these standards, workable street
systems must be established. When a pattern of widths based on function for a given area
has been established, the pattern shall be followed until another system can be established or
ties into a collector or arterial system. Access control and acceleration and deceleration lanes
6-5
may be required to properly handle traffic flow and to protect the carrying capacity of the street.
-----------------
* Note: For arterial standards, see Sections 6-107 G and H.
6-6
G. Arterial right-of-way widths shall be as shown in the Comprehensive Plan and where not shown
thereon shall be 120 feet, except that for heavy traffic 150 feet of right-of-way may be required
within 250 feet from the intersection of the center lines of an arterial street with any other arterial
or collector street and taper to 120 feet at a distance of 350 feet from the intersection centerline.
H. For streets and roadways on the Functional Classification System of the County, prevailing
design standards shall apply.
I. Wherever possible, there shall be an inside tangent at least 100 feet in length introduced between
reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
J. Streets shall be laid out so as to provide for horizontal sight distances on all curves depending
upon design speed. These distances shall be:
Arterial Streets: 500 feet
Collector Streets: 300 feet
Local Streets: 200 feet
The sight distance shall be measured within street rights-of-way from a height of four and
one-half feet above the proposed pavement surface in the right-hand lane of the roadway.
K. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall
intersect any other street at less than 80 degrees.
L. Street jogs are to be avoided on arterial and collector streets. On local streets, center line offsets
of less than 150 feet should be avoided.
M. Roadway grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed the following with due allowance for
reasonable vertical curves:
Roadway Type Percent Grade
Arterial 3%
Collector 4%
Local 5%
Marginal Access 5%
N. No roadway grade shall be less than 0.50 of one percent, unless approved by the applicable
engineer. Greater percentages of grade may be required where necessary to provide adequate
drainage.
6-7
O. Roadway pavement at intersections shall be rounded by the following minimum radii:
Minimum
Type of Roadway Intersection Width Curb Radii
Local Residential Local Residential 20 feet
Local Residential Collector 30 feet
Local Residential Arterial 30 feet
Commercial/Industrial Commercial/Industrial
Collector or Arterial Collector or Arterial 50 feet
P. Half-streets shall be avoided, except for arterial streets and collector streets where applicable, or
where they are essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the
other requirements of these regulations; or, when the Planning Commission finds that it will be
practicable to require the dedication of the other half of the street when the adjoining property is
subdivided. Whenever a half-street, or portion thereof, exists and is adjacent to a tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. No construction of the
roadway shall occur until the full right-of-way is provided.
Q. The length of cul-de-sacs and the dimensions of the turn-around shall be determined as follows:
1. Cul-de-sacs in single-family areas should not generally be longer than seven times the
average lot width or 600 feet, whichever is less. In multiple-family residential areas, such
streets shall not exceed 300 feet.
2. In urban type subdivisions, they shall have a turn-diameter of at least 70 feet and a street
property line diameter of at least 100 feet, or shall have an alternate turn-around area such
as hammerheads, etc., as providing service equal to the foregoing requirement.
3. For rural type subdivisions, a minimum street property line diameter of 120 feet or more may
be required for fire protection and other equipment.
R. Subdividers are encouraged to consider projects designed to maximize solar access when not in
conflict with existing contours or drainage. When the long axis of individual structures is parallel
to the street, streets should be oriented as nearly as possible in an east/west direction. If the long
axis of structures is perpendicular to the street, north/south street orientation is preferable for
solar access purposes.
108 Alleys.
A. Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial areas, except that the Planning Commission
may waive this requirement where other definite and assured provision is made for service
access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking spaces consistent and adequate for the
uses proposed. Alleys in residential districts are to be discouraged.
B. When provided, the minimum right-of-way of an alley shall be 20 feet.
6-8
C. Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, a
turning radius shall be provided to permit safe vehicular movement.
D. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, such alleys shall be
provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the dead-end.
109 Blocks and Pedestrian Ways.
A. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to:
1. Provision of adequate building sites suitable for the special needs of the type of use
contemplated.
2. Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions, off-street parking and loading, etc.
3. Need for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic.
4. Limitations and opportunities of topography.
B. A block should not exceed 1,340 feet in length, unless the previous layout or topographic
conditions justify a modification. In general, blocks shall not be less than 400 feet unless
necessary because of existing street patterns.
C. All blocks shall be so designed so as to provide two tiers of lots, unless a different arrangement is
required in order to comply with or be permitted by other sections of these regulations.
D. Blocks may be irregular in shape, provided they are harmonious with the overall pattern of blocks
in the proposed subdivision.
E. In extra long blocks, a public pedestrian way may be required to provide access to public or
private facilities such as schools or parks. (See Section 2-102 for definition of PEDESTRIAN
WAY [CROSSWALK].)
110 Lots.
A. The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation, and the minimum building setback lines, if any
desired, shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development
and use contemplated. (See Section 6-106 for flag lots.)
B. Lot dimensions shall conform to the minimum requirements of applicable zoning regulations and
sanitary codes, unless higher standards are established in accordance with this subsection:
1. All subdivisions in the City shall be connected to public water supply and sewage disposal
systems as well as subdivisions in the surrounding jurisdiction wherever the latter is
6-9
deemed feasible by the Governing Body.*
2. If a proposed residential subdivision is serviced with public water supply, but intends to use a
community sewer system (cluster system) the minimum lot area requirement shall be
12,500 square feet in the City or unincorporated area.
3. If a proposed residential subdivision is serviced with a public water supply, but intends to use
an alternative wastewater treatment system and tile field for a sewage disposal system, the
minimum lot area requirement shall be 80,000 square feet in the unincorporated area
only.**
4. If a proposed residential subdivision in the unincorporated areas is serviced by on-lot well for
water supply, and intends to use a community sewer system (cluster system), the minimum
lot area requirement shall be 43,560 square feet in the unincorporated area.
5. If a proposed residential subdivision in the unincorporated area is serviced by neither a public
water supply or a public sewage disposal system and intends to use an on-lot well for water
supply and an alternative wastewater treatment system for sewage disposal, the minimum
lot area requirement shall be 80,000 square feet.**
6. Notwithstanding the provisions of these regulations in Sections 6-110B2 and 3, it is the intent
of these regulations to encourage the installation of public water supplies and public sewage
disposal systems wherever feasible. In order to determine such feasibility, the Planning
Commission may require the subdivider to provide certain basic engineering data and cost
estimates on which to base such a decision. Furthermore, if on-lot water supply and
sewage disposal installations are used, additional lot area may be required if the area to be
subdivided has a high water table, is periodically flooded with water or if the soil conditions
prove to be unsuitable based on percolations test which may be required of the subdivider.
When the alternative wastewater treatment system is used for sewage disposal, the edge of
the alternative wastewater treatment system must not be less than 300 feet from any existing
off-premises dwelling or 100 feet from the nearest property line.**
C. In those areas where there may be municipal-type water and/or sanitary sewer facilities
anticipated in the foreseeable future, but which are not yet available, the Planning Commission
may require that lots be so designed and arranged that they may readily be converted to urban
type building sites without replatting. When such a condition prevails, land should be subdivided
into lots so that by combining lots, a building site is created initially with an area of not less than
that required for on-lot wells and/or sewage treatment systems. The creation of such a building
site through use of multiple groups of lots shall be contingent upon the establishment for record of
restrictive covenants satisfactory to the legal counsel of the Planning Commission, providing that
no more than one dwelling unit shall be built on
------------------------
* NOTE: All public sanitary sewer systems and sewage treatment plants are further subject to the regulations of the
Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
** NOTE: In calculating the size of the zoning lot, the land in an adjacent right-of-way may be included if it is part of the legal
description of the lot.
6-10
such an aggregate group of lots until such time as municipal-type water and sewer service is
available.
D. As a general guideline, the maximum depth of all residential lots shall not exceed two and
one-half times the width thereof. For all other types of lots, the depth shall not exceed three times
the width.
E. In the City, the area of the street right-of-way shall not be included and calculated in the size of
the lot with respect to minimum lot size requirements of these regulations or of any zoning regulations
applicable to the property. The area of the adjacent street right-of-way may be included and
calculated for lots in the unincorporated area; however, if it is part of the legal description of the
lot. Lots shall be required to have more than the minimum area dimensions provided for in this
section where such greater area or dimensions are required to meet the yard requirements of the
zoning regulations.
F. There shall be no double frontage lots for individual dwellings (e.g., single and two-family units),
except where the lots abut upon a limited access highway or arterial street or where the
topography of the land prevents reasonable subdivision in small units. Double frontage lots shall
not have vehicular access between such lots and an abutting limited access highway or arterial
street.
G. Reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except where such are essential to provide a separation
of residential development from limited access highways and arterial streets or to overcome
specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
H. Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width, if necessary, to permit appropriate building
setback from and orientation to both streets.
I. Side lines of lots shall be at right angles or radial to the street line or substantially so.
111 Easements.
A. Utility easements shall be provided where necessary and centered on rear or side lot lines. Such
easements shall be at least 20 feet wide along rear lot lines and 10 feet wide along side lot lines,
except that easements for street lighting purposes shall not in any event be required to exceed 10
feet. Side lot easements, when needed for other than street lighting purposes such as drainage,
may exceed 10 feet.
B. Drainage Easements. If a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way or channel or
a detention pond is constructed, then a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way shall be
provided. Such easement or right-of-way shall conform substantially to the lines of such
watercourse and location of a detention pond and shall be of such width or construction, or both,
as may be necessary to assure adequate storm water drainage and for access for maintenance
thereof. All drainage easements shall be vegetated with perennial
6-11
grasses or otherwise stabilized to prevent soil erosion and sediment movement by wind or water
by best management practices. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection
therewith. (See Section 2-102 for definition of DETENTION POND.)
In rural-type subdivisions, a triangular drainage and utility easement may be required at the
corners of intersecting street rights-of-way. Where street rights-of-way intersect at 90 degrees,
the limit of such easement would be defined by a line drawn between two points located on the
right-of-way lines which are 25 feet back each way from the corner. All drainage easements will
be vegetated with adapted perennial grasses or otherwise stabilized to prevent soil erosion and
sediment movement by wind or water by best management practices.
C. Vision triangle easements may be required on any corner lot to provide an open and usable
vision path for drivers of vehicles approaching the intersection. The extent of vision triangle
easements shall be based on the type of intersection (3-way, four, protected, unprotected, etc.);
the type of street (local, collector, arterial, commercial or industrial); topography; proposed street
grades (if any); and the design speeds contemplated for such roadways. (See Section 2-102 for
definition of VISION TRIANGLE.)
D. Wherever a lot or group of lots side or back on to an existing high pressure oil or gas transmission
line, a building setback easement shall be established on each side of such line to the minimum
safe standards as provided by the applicable oil or gas company to the subdivider or to such
standards as may be adopted by the City, state or federal governments, whichever provides the
most setback distance. The easement shall be provided on that part of the lot which abuts the oil
or gas line and no principal buildings or structures shall be located or constructed within such an
easement.
E. A screening easement may be required to provide for fencing and/or an adequate area for the
mature growth of landscaping with appropriate maintenance. (See Section 2-102 for definition of
SCREENING.)
112 Commercial and Industrial Subdivisions.
A. Streets. Notwithstanding the other provisions of these regulations, the minimum width of streets
adjacent to areas designed, proposed or zoned for commercial or industrial use may be
increased by the Planning Commission to such extent as may be deemed necessary to assure
the free flow of through traffic without interference from parked or parking motor vehicles.
B. Blocks and lots intended for commercial or industrial use shall be designed specifically for such
purpose with adequate space set aside for off-street parking and loading.
C. Marginal Access Street. When lots or blocks in a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision
front on any limited access highway or arterial street, the subdivider may be required to dedicate
and improve a marginal access street to provide ingress and egress to and from such lots or
blocks.
7-1
ARTICLE 7. INSTALLATION OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
100 Subdivision Types. For the purposes of these regulations, subdivisions shall be classified as follows:
A. Urban Type Subdivisions.
1. All subdivisions located wholly within the corporate limits of the City.
2. All subdivisions located partially within, adjoining or touching the corporate limits of the City.
3. All subdivisions adjoining or touching the boundary of a tract of land for which annexation
proceedings have commenced by the City or the owner has a pending request to be
annexed.
4. All subdivisions adjoining or touching another subdivision which has previously received final
plat approval by the City and adjoins or touches the corporate limits of the City.
5. All subdivisions which have or intend to have both municipal type water supply and sewage
disposal systems, or are subdividing all or portions of the subdivision for commercial or
industrial purposes, or for public or semi-public purposes which are directly related to an
urban type residential subdivision. (Note: Service by a rural water district could be
considered a "municipal type" if the particular size of pipes in that location permitted adequate
quantity and pressure commensurate with urban needs.)
B. Rural Type Subdivisions. All other subdivisions required to be platted by these regulations not
otherwise classified as the urban type as described in Section 7-100A.
101 Engineering and Governmental Jurisdiction. In setting certain standards and specifications,
approving engineering drawings, inspecting improvements, recommending acceptance of
improvements, preparing petition forms and establishing the amount of surety for guaranteeing the
installation of such improvements; the engineer designated by the City, the County Engineer, or utility
provider representative shall be designated as responsible for the improvements within their respective
jurisdictions. The term "applicable" Governing Body may mean either the City Council for urban type
subdivisions in the City, or the township trustees or County Board of Commissioners for urban and rural
type subdivisions in the unincorporated area. "The" Governing Body refers to the City only.
Coordination to achieve cooperation among the governing bodies is the responsibility of the City and, in
particular, the Subdivision Administrator.
102 Required Improvements. As a condition to final plat approval, the subdivider of a proposed
subdivision shall be responsible to install or, in cooperation with governmental bodies and utility
companies, cause to be installed the following necessary facilities and improvements as listed below.
The design and installation of such facilities and improvements shall include such sizing of pipes and
extensions of streets as may be deemed desirable within the subdivision to facilitate development of
adjacent land. All requirements are applicable to both urban and rural- type subdivisions as defined in
7-2
Section 7-100 unless specifically described otherwise.
A. All streets, alleys, curbs, gutters and street drainage facilities in urban type subdivisions shall be
constructed in accordance with established City standards. All urban type streets shall be constructed
of concrete, asphalt or asphaltic concrete and no gravel or sanded roadways shall be
constructed. All roadways in rural type subdivisions shall be constructed in accordance with
standards established by the County Engineer with gravel or sanded surface and no other
materials such as oiled surface, macadam or similar materials shall be used. If other than gravel
or sanded surface materials are particularly required, urban construction standards as described
above shall apply. To accommodate any future improvements in both urban and rural areas, the
entire right-of-way of collector and local streets and roadways shall be graded to match the level
of the road surface. All stumps, trees that cannot be saved, boulders and similar items shall be
removed from such right-of-way. In the unincorporated area, streets and roadways are subject to
final acceptance by the applicable township trustee or the County.
B. A storm drainage system shall be provided, separate and independent of the sanitary sewer
system, meeting all of the specifications and requirements of the City in urban type subdivisions
or the County Engineer in rural types. Such storm drainage system shall be connected to any
existing storm sewer system, where available, or if such connection is not available, other
adequate means for the discharge of such storm water including the use of detention ponds shall
be provided by the subdivider into the nearest major water channel. If it is determined that
adequate drainage can be accomplished by a natural drainage way across private property, a
drainage easement may be required; however, any initial channelization is the responsibility of
the subdivider and continued maintenance the responsibility of the adjacent property owner(s).
C. Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with standards set by the City in urban type
subdivisions under the following conditions: (Also, see Section 6-109E for pedestrian ways.)
1. Sidewalks shall be required on at least one side of the street when needed to service
pedestrian traffic flow leading to schools, parks, shopping areas or places of public
assembly and where heavy traffic would warrant sidewalks for safety purposes. Sidewalks
shall also be required in residential areas where the lot frontage is less than 150 feet. Sidewalks
shall be required to extend or complete connecting links in the sidewalk system.
Location of sidewalks will be per the Sidewalk Master Plan. 2. In
general, sidewalks shall be constructed with the inside edge of the sidewalk on the property
line, except in the central business district.
3. All sidewalks shall provide handicap access in conformity with K.S.A. 58-1301 et seq. and the
federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 USCA 12101, as may be amended.
D. Street signs of such location, type and size as shall be approved by the applicable Governing
Body, giving due regard to the prevailing type, size and pattern of location utilized throughout the
area.
E. Wherever a municipal-type water supply system or its equivalent is required to be constructed by
these regulations, such construction shall be in accordance with the standards and requirements
set by the applicable agency supplying the water. In all other areas, a water supply shall be
7-3
provided which meets the standards of the County Sanitary Code. In those areas where there is
a municipal type water supply system, mains shall be of such size as to support the use of fire
hydrants as required by Section 7-102F.
F. Fire hydrants of the type and quality specified by City standards, but not less than the minimum
standards of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), shall be provided wherever there
shall be constructed a municipal type water supply system. Such hydrants shall be subject to the
inspection and approval of the applicable Fire Chief.
G. Sanitary Sewer Systems.
1. Wherever sanitary sewers are to be installed as required by these regulations, such sewers
are to be constructed in accordance with standards set by the City subject to the regulations
of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
2. Wherever alternative onsite wastewater treatment system, or community sewer system
(cluster system) are to be used for sewage disposal on individual lots, the determination of
the suitability of the lot(s) and the standards for installation and inspection of such facilities
shall be governed by the County Sanitary Code.
H. Underground wiring in residential subdivisions, unless found to be unfeasible, is required for
electric power, street lights and telephone service in urban type subdivision, except:
1. For lines rated over 12,000 volts;
2. Appurtenance serving such lines which may be mounted on the ground, such as transformers,
transformer pads, telephone service pedestals and street light poles; or
3. For those proposed subdivisions or replats of existing subdivisions located in areas which
presently have an overhead type utility distribution system.
All such installation shall be under contract with the applicable utility provider. Cable television, if
installed, shall be placed underground in accordance with the above requirements. Where telephone,
electric, street lights and gas lines are placed underground
7-4
entirely throughout a subdivision, conduits or cables shall be placed within easements or
dedicated public ways in a manner which will not conflict with other underground services.
Further, all transformer boxes shall be located so as not to be unsightly or hazardous to the
public.
Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring underground installation of lines beyond the
boundaries of the area contained in the preliminary plat.
All utility lines for telephone and electric service, when carried on overhead poles in other than the
above urban type subdivision, shall be placed in rear lot line easements or designated side lot line
easements.
I. If screening of public or private areas is to be required, a screening plan of landscaping and/or
fencing shall be prepared and approved by the Planning Commission and such screening
installed. (See Section 2-102 for definition of SCREENING.)
J. Monuments as shown on the final plat shall be placed at all central points such as block corners,
angle points, points of curves in streets and as may be required by the applicable engineer.
Monuments shall be made of iron pipe or solid steel rods, e.g., rebars which are not less than 1/2
inch in outside diameter and not less than 24 inches in length and capped with a plastic or metal
top which identifies the registration number of the surveyor. All monuments shall be securely
placed and set in such a manner that the top of the monument shall be at or nine inches below
grade ground level depending upon whether cultivation of the land is anticipated. Bench marks
may also be required of such material, size and length as may be approved by the applicable
engineer. (See Section 2-102 for definitions of BENCH MARK and MONUMENT and Sections
5-101 D and E for monuments and bench mark(s) to be shown on the final plat.)
K. Whenever existing sanitary or storm water sewers, water lines, drainage channels, culverts,
underground or overhead electric and communication lines, gas lines, pipe lines, transmission
lines are required to be relocated due to the subdivision or construction of improvements required
as a condition of approval of the subdivision and in the event such was not known at the time of
subdivision approval for any reason, the costs of such relocation shall be the sole responsibility of
the subdivider.
L. Where required, applicable measures will be taken during construction to minimize soil erosion
and sedimentation by wind or water. Conservation standards shall be adhered to which have
been adopted by the County Conservation District.
M. An access roadway permit is required to be obtained from the County Fire Department in the
unincorporated area of the County and a similar permit from the City Fire Department in the city
limits whenever a facility, building or portion of a building is constructed more than 150 feet from
the nearest street or road right-of-way line. Such a permit is required under the International Fire
7-5
Code to provide appropriate access for fire fighting apparatus. Information regarding specifications
for the access drive relative to width, driving surface, vertical clearance, turnaround,
bridges and floodplain access may be obtained from the Fire Department.
103 Exceptions for Existing Improvements.
A. Where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision or concerns an area presently having any or
all required improvements as set out in Section 7-102 and where such improvements meet the
requirements of said section and are in good condition as determined by the applicable
Governing Body, no further provision need be made by the subdivider to duplicate such
improvements. Where such existing improvements, however, do not meet the requirements, the
subdivider shall provide for the repair, correction or replacement of such improvements so that all
improvements will then meet the aforesaid requirements.
B. Where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision or concerns an area presently abutting or
containing any existing public street of less than the minimum required right-of-way width or
roadway width, land shall be dedicated in so far as is possible so as to provide for a minimum
street right-of-way width and an additional roadway pavement meeting the minimum standards as
set by these regulations. The applicable Governing Body shall determine what adjustment to
make where the aforesaid widenings merge with existing streets which are of smaller width at the
boundary of such proposed subdivision. The minimum right-of-way and roadway width required
by these regulations may be reduced to match an existing roadway system if the extension of
such roadway is already improved at each end of the roadway in the subdivision.
104 Agreement and Guarantees for Installation of Required Improvements. Except for monuments,
one of the following methods shall be used by the subdivider to guarantee that improvements required
by these regulations can or will be installed in accordance with approved plans and specifications. This
does not preclude the possibility that the applicable Governing Body may, at its discretion and in
recognition of its financial position, share in the cost of improvements, especially oversized improvements
which may benefit other related areas or the municipality-at-large: (See Section 2-102 for
definition of HOMEOWNERS’ ASSOCIATION.)
A. Fiscal sureties may be offered and the following shall apply: (See Section 2-102 for definition of
SUBDIVIDER'S AGREEMENT.)
1. The subdivider shall enter into a "Subdivider's Agreement" with the applicable Governing
Body under which the subdivider agrees to install such required improvements. Such
agreement shall be conditioned upon the acceptances of the final plat by the applicable
Governing Body and filed with the applicable Clerk.
2. Simultaneously with the execution of the Subdivider's Agreement provided for in Section
7-104A1, the subdivider shall furnish a corporate completion bond by a firm authorized to do
7-6
business in Kansas with good and sufficient sureties thereon or a cashier's check, escrow
account or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the applicable Governing Body, in the
amount of the estimated cost as approved by the official responsible for setting and
enforcing the applicable design and construction standards of the installation of the required
improvements. Such financial guarantee shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the
final plat and further conditioned upon the actual completion and satisfactory installation of
such required improvements within two years from the date that the final plat is accepted by
the Governing Body.
3. Simultaneously with the execution of the Subdivider's Agreement provided for in Section
7-104A1, if the subdivider furnishes a corporate completion bond, he or she shall also
deposit in escrow with the applicable Governing Body cash in the amount of 15% of the
cost of all improvements to be made in accordance with the plans and specifications for
required improvements or an equivalent amount in the form of a maintenance bond or other
securities that may be deemed sufficient by the applicable Governing Body. If a subdivider
furnishes a cashier's check, escrow account or irrevocable letter of credit, 15% of the
amount of such guarantees shall be returned by, or held as a deposit in escrow after, the
final completion of such improvements. The subdivider shall agree that such deposit in
escrow may be held by the applicable Governing Body for a period of 18 months after such
improvements are completed for the purpose of:
a. Guaranteeing and securing the correction of any defect in material or workmanship
furnished for such improvements, latent in character, and not discernible at the time of
final inspection or acceptance by the applicable Governing Body; and
b. Guarantee against any damage to such improvements by reason of the settling of the
ground, base or foundation thereof.
Such escrow agreement shall provide that, as such defects have so developed, that the
deposit may be applied by the applicable Governing Body for any amounts incurred
correcting such defects; and that the balance of such deposit, if any, held at the end of such
18-month period shall be returned by the applicable Governing Body to the depositor, or
paid to the order of the depositor without payment of interest.
B. Petitions to the applicable Governing Body may be submitted as a means of guaranteeing to
such Governing Body the authority to install improvements at such time as they deem
appropriate. Petitions may be submitted only when the following conditions exist:
1. The petitions must be valid as may be provided for under Kansas law.
2. The petitions must be approved by the applicable Governing Body concurrently with the
acceptance of the final plat.
3. The initiating resolution for such improvement must be adopted by the applicable Governing
Body concurrently with the petition approval or as soon thereafter as may be provided by
law. The cost of the publication of said resolution shall be born by the subdivider.
7-7
4. A certificate signed by the petitioner must be recorded with the County Register of Deeds
stating that such petitions have been filed and approved by the applicable Governing Body
and that certain land within the plat as described will be liable in the future for special
assessment for the required improvements authorized.
C. For streets and related drainage only in rural type subdivisions, preconstruction of improvements
as an alternative method of guaranteeing their installation may be used if approved by the County
Governing Body. In this event, the subdivider may request such Governing Body to hold the final
plat acceptance until such time as an inspection certifies that the required improvements have
been properly constructed. Such a preconstruction procedure shall be temporarily conditioned on
subsequent acceptance of the final plat and a time limit for actual construction mutually agreed
upon. Maintenance guarantees may also be required if deemed desirable. (See Section
7-104A3 for maintenance guarantee methods.)
D. The subdivider shall, prior to the acceptance of the final plat, submit a letter from the utility
provider(s) involved stating that satisfactory arrangements have been made by the subdivider
guaranteeing the installation of their respective services.
E. Monuments and bench marks shall be installed and their installation certified by a licensed land
surveyor on the final plat before such plat is recorded with the County Register of Deeds. (See
Section 5-101 Q 1 for Land Surveyor's Certificate.)
7-8
105 Off-site Improvements. The applicable Governing Body may, upon making a finding of necessity,
require the subdivider to install or upgrade off-site improvements located outside the perimeter of a
subdivision if such need is substantially created by a proposed subdivision. Such off-site improvements
should be within dedicated rights-of-way or easements and serve a public purpose. The financing and
guaranteeing of such improvements shall be administered as if they were the same as on-site improvements
under Section 7-104. The applicable Governing Body may require such subdivision to
participate in the following facilities and improvements, or any other off-site improvements as
recommended by the Planning Commission, if the need is created by a proposed subdivision:
A. Drainage improvements;
B. Pedestrian ways and sidewalks;
C. Screening;
D. Special grading requirements;
E. Street improvements; or
F. Traffic control devices.
7-9
8-1
ARTICLE 8. IMPROVEMENT PROCEDURES
100 Submittal of Petitions. If petitions are proposed to meet the requirements of Article 7, the subdivider
shall so indicate at the time of submittal of the preliminary plat. If the petition method is authorized by
the applicable Governing Body, petitions shall accompany the final plat for approval by such Governing
Body.
101 Final Improvement Plans. When the use of petitions has not been requested by the subdivider or
authorized by the applicable Governing Body and a letter(s) of satisfactory arrangements from a utility
provider(s) are not being utilized to guarantee improvements (See Section 7-104D for letter from utility),
the subdivider shall have prepared by an engineer (which may be contracted for privately or with any
governmental agency or utility), engineering drawings for proposed required improvements containing
the data and information specified in Section 8-101A. Such drawings shall be certified by a licensed
engineer and shall be submitted to the applicable reviewing official in duplicate at least 20 days prior to
the date that approval is requested.
A. Content. The engineering drawings shall contain the following data plus additional information
deemed necessary by the applicable engineer:
1. Plans, details, specifications and cost estimates for roadway, alley and sidewalk construction;
including plans, profile indicating existing topography and elevation including curb and
sidewalk elevation when required, intersection control elevation and paving geometrics for
each street with a typical cross section of the roadway. The profiles of grade lines shall be
shown to a scale of one inch equals 100 feet horizontal, and one inch equals 10 feet
vertical; or to a scale approved by the applicable engineer. This information shall be shown
on standard plan and profile sheets unless otherwise required by the engineer and use
topographic information cited in Section 5-100B3.
2. Plans, profiles, details, specifications and cost estimates of proposed storm drainage
improvements.
3. Plans, profiles, details, specifications and cost estimates of proposed water distribution system,
water supply facilities and fire hydrants.
4. Plans, profiles, details, specifications and cost estimates of proposed sanitary sewage system.
5. All plans for other utilities such as for electric, gas and telephone shall be prepared by or at the
direction of the utility providing the service.
8-2
B. Review. The applicable engineer, official or agency responsible for determining specifications
and standards shall review all engineering drawings in order to determine whether such drawings
are consistent with the approved final plat and comply with the design standards. If such
drawings are consistent and so comply, the reviewing official shall forward to the applicable
Governing Body a notice to that effect. In the event that the drawings do not so comply, the
reviewing official shall notify the subdivider of the specific manner in which such drawings do not
comply, and he may then correct such drawings. If such drawings are not corrected, the
reviewing official shall forward to such Governing Body a notice as to the items of nonconformity
or noncompliance.
102 Construction of Improvements. No improvements shall be constructed nor shall any work
preliminary thereto be done, except as provided for under a preconstruction agreement in rural-type
subdivisions, until such time as the engineering construction drawings shall have been approved and
there shall have been compliance with all of the requirements relating to the Subdivider's Agreement
and such guarantees as are specified in Section 7-104 of these regulations.
A. Inspection. All improvements constructed or erected shall be subject to inspection by the
applicable engineer or official responsible for setting and enforcing the applicable design and
construction standards of the required improvements. The cost attributable to all inspections
required by these regulations shall be charged to and paid by the subdivider. In so far as is
possible, the subdivider shall give at least 48 hours notification to such official prior to the performance
of any inspection work.
B. Inspection Procedures. After notice is received as specified in Section 8-102A above, the
applicable engineer or official designated may conduct an on-site inspection to determine that the
work complies with the approved engineering plans and specifications. If in the opinion of such
engineer or official, the work does not comply with such final drawings, he shall have authority to
order that all such work shall be terminated until such time as necessary steps are taken to
correct any defects or deficiencies. Upon the correction of such defects or deficiencies, the
subdivider shall again notify the applicable engineer or official as provided in Section 8-102A that
the work is again ready for inspection.
C. Final Inspection. Upon completion of all improvements within the area covered by the final plat,
the subdivider shall notify the applicable engineer or official designated in Section 8-102A above,
who shall thereupon conduct a final inspection of all improvements installed. If such final
inspection indicates that there are any defects or deficiencies in such improvements as installed,
or if there are any deviations in such improvements as installed from the final engineering plans
and specifications, he shall notify the subdivider in writing and the subdivider shall, at his sole cost
and expense, correct such defects or deviations within six months of the date of notification.
When such defects, deficiencies or deviations have been corrected, the
8-3
subdivider shall notify the official that the improvements are again ready for final inspection. After
the final inspection is made and before acceptance of the improvement by the applicable
Governing Body, the subdivider shall file a statement with the engineer or official which is
executed by the subdivider, certifying that all obligations incurred in the construction of the
improvement involved have been properly paid and settled.
103 Acceptance of Improvements. If a final inspection indicates that all improvements as installed
contain no unacceptable defects, deficiencies or deviations, within 15 days from the submission of the
subdivider's statement of obligation paid, the applicable engineer or official designated shall certify to
the applicable Governing Body and utility provider(s) that all improvements have been installed in
conformity with the engineering plans and specifications accompanying the final plat. Upon the receipt
by the applicable Governing Body of such notification and in conformity with the requirements of these
regulations and all other applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations, such Governing Body shall
thereupon by resolution or utility by letter formally accept such improvements. The improvements shall
become the property of such Governing Body or utility provider involved. Prior to this final action,
however, neither the acceptance of the final plat, any subsequent annexation to the City or irrespective
of any act(s) of employees, such actions shall not constitute their formal acceptance of improvements.

ARTICLE 9. PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF LOT SPLITS
100 Application Procedure. The Planning Commission is hereby authorized to approve or disapprove lot
splits. An application with the required fee for a lot split approval shall be submitted to the Subdivision
Administrator by the owner of the landat least 15 days prior to the next regular meeting of the Planning
Commission. (See Section 3-109 for Fees.) Four copies of a drawing to scale of the lots involved if
there are no structures on the lot shall accompany the application or four copies of a survey if there are
structures on the lot showing the precise location of structures thereon. Each drawing or survey shall
show the location, dimensions and legal description of the proposed split; the square footage contained
in each portion of the original lot; all existing easements including public reservations such as building
setback lines or access control and a certificate of approval as worded in Section 9-101C.
Written notices shall be distributed by the Administrator to all owners of land adjacent to the property
proposed to be split including such owners across the street or other public way. The application for a
lot split must be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of all persons to receive notices.
Such owners shall have 10 days from the date of mailing the notification to inform the Administrator of
any protest or concerns they may have on the lot split. The 10 day waiting period may be waived upon
presentation of a written statement of no objection from those to be notified.
101 Approval Guidelines. Approval or disapproval of lot splits shall be made based on the following
guidelines:
A. A lot split shall not be approved unless all the following requirements have or can be satisfied:
1. A new street or alley is needed or proposed.
2. A vacation of streets, alleys, setback lines, access control or easements is required and has
not been satisfied.
3. Such action will result in significant increases in service requirements, e.g., utilities, drainage,
sidewalks, traffic control, streets, etc. or will interfere with maintaining existing service levels,
e.g., additional curb cuts, repaving, etc.
4. There is less street right-of-way than required by these regulations or the Comprehensive Plan
unless such dedication can be made by separate instrument.
5. All easement requirements have not been satisfied.
6. Such split will result in a lot without direct access from its frontage to an opened public street.
(See Section 6-106 for Access.)
7. A substandard sized lot will be created or an existing structure will not be able to meet all yard
requirements according to applicable zoning regulations or sanitary code.
8. The lot is subject to periodic flooding which cannot be feasibly corrected by fill.
9. The lot has been previously split without replatting.
9-2
B. The Planning Commission may make such additional requirements as deemed necessary to
carry out the intent and purpose of existing land development regulations and applicable
Governing Body policy. Requirements may include, but not be limited to, the installation of public
facilities, water supply and sewage disposal and/or the dedication of right-of-way and easements.
C. The Planning Commission shall, in writing, either approve with or without conditions or disapprove
the lot split within 45 days of application. If approved, and after all conditions have been met, the
Chairperson of the Planning Commission shall sign the following certificate of approval as
required on the lot split drawing or survey. Acknowledgement of the certificate may be made by a
notary public or by the County Clerk, Register of Deeds, Mayor or Clerk. (See K.S.A. 58-2211, as
amended.)

ARTICLE 10. VACATIONS AND CORRECTIONS
100 Vacation of Unrecorded Plat.
A. Upon written request of the subdivider to the Planning Commission, a preliminary or final plat may
be withdrawn from consideration either before or after approval by the Commission. Upon
approval of the request by a motion of the Commission, the Subdivision Administrator is
automatically directed to remove the case file from the City records.
B. Upon written request of the subdivider to the Clerk, a final plat for which dedications, if any, have
been accepted by the applicable Governing Body may be vacated by motion of such Governing
Body; provided, that (1) the plat has not been recorded; (2) no lots have been sold or transferred;
and (3) no improvements have been installed. After the plat is vacated, the Administrator shall
see that all fiscal sureties are returned to the subdivider except for those expenditures which have
been incurred by the City or County in administrative, legal or engineering costs prior to the date
of the request for vacation. Upon the return of such sureties, the Administrator is automatically
directed to remove the case file including any petitions from the City records.
C. Upon determining from the County Register of Deeds that a final plat has not been recorded
within 60 days from its final acceptance by the Governing Body or within 15 days after a final
acceptance by the County Governing Body under the preconstruction procedures of Section
7-104C, the Administrator shall notify the subdivider that the plat is null and void and that the
case file will be removed from the City records within 30 days unless a reapplication for platting is
received during that time. (See Section 4-112 for Recording of Final Plat.)
101 Vacation of Recorded Plat.
A. (Inside the City or in the extraterritorial subdivision jurisdiction area.) Recorded plats may be
vacated by either replatting according to Section 10-101A1 below or directly vacated according to
Section 10-101A2:
1. According to K.S.A. 12-512b, any recorded plat or part thereof or street, alley or other public
reservation, including, without limitation, easements, dedicated building setback lines and
access control, whether established by instrument, condemnation or earlier plats, shall be
vacated both as to use and as to title without any further proceedings upon the filing and
recording with the County Register of Deeds in accordance with K.S.A. 12-403, any plat or
replat duly executed in accordance with these regulations which embraces the same lands
as those heretofore embraced by the earlier plat or part thereof or street, alley or other
public reservation. Streets, alleys or other public reservations which may be vacated shall
revert, as provided for in K.S.A. 12-506, to
10-2
abutting property owners according to their frontage thereon; provided, that such land to be
reverted was derived directly or indirectly from the owner of the land from which such street,
alley or public reservation was originally platted. The proper completion of the Owner's
Certificate and Dedication as required by Section 5-101 Q 2 shall constitute appropriate
notice to all persons having property rights or interests affected by the above platting or
replatting.
2. Recorded plats may also be vacated without replatting. The procedure is the same as
provided for in Section 10-103.
102 Correction of Platting Errors.
A. According to K.S.A. 12-420, procedures are provided to correct certain platting errors. If, after
recording a final plat, an error is found in distances, angles, bearings, subdivision or street names,
block or lot numbers, the computation of dimension or elevation or other details of the plat, except
in connection with the outer boundaries of the plat, and if the property described in that part of the
plat containing the error is under the ownership of the person who caused the plat to be prepared,
the applicable City or County Engineer, after substantiation of the existence of the error, may file
an affidavit with the County Register of Deeds that the error was made. The affidavit shall
describe the nature and extent of the error and the appropriate correction. The Register of Deeds
shall record the affidavit and shall place in the margin of the recorded plat a notation that the
affidavit has been filed, the date of filing and the book and page where it is recorded. The filing of
the affidavit shall correct any such errors, but shall have no effect on the validity of the plat or any
property interest recorded by reference thereto. A copy of the recorded affidavit shall be filed with
the Subdivision Administrator. The County will bill the person requesting the correction for
engineering costs and recording fees.
103 Vacation of Streets, Alleys, Easements and Plats.
A. (Inside the City only.) According to K.S.A. 12-504 and 505, the following procedures are provided
to vacate streets, alleys or other public reservations such as, but not limited to public easements,
dedicated building setback lines, access control, or a part thereof, and including all or parts of
recorded plats:*
1. Petitions for vacations received from the Governing Body, the owner of platted land or the
owner of land adjoining on both sides of any street, alley, easement or other public
reservation may be filed with the Clerk and transmitted to the Subdivision Administrator for
processing. All nongovernmental petitioners will be billed a processing fee. (See Section
3-109 for Fees.)
* Note: The same statutory procedure may be used to exclude a portion of land from the boundaries of the City, i.e., the
land could also be "deannexed".
The Planning Commission shall give public notice of a hearing on a proposed vacation by
10-3
publication once in the official city newspaper by the Subdivision Administrator. At least 20
days shall elapse between the date of such publication and the date set for such hearing.
Such notice shall state (1) the nature of the vacation petition, (2) the legal description of
the property and (3) the date, time and place for the hearing before the Planning
Commission. The notice may contain the information that the hearing may be adjourned
from time to time upon a motion to continue in the future at some stated date, time and
place. Furthermore, the Commission by rule shall mail a notice at least 20 days before the
hearing to all affected utility providers; all owners of land proposed for vacation; all
landowners abutting a street, alley or easement including any segment remaining open; and
owners on the opposite side of the street from vacations of setbacks and access control.
The petitioner(s) shall provide a list of such landowners as required by the Subdivision
Administrator, including names, addresses and zip codes. Such notice to providers and
landowners shall be mailed so that at least 20 days shall elapse between the mailing date
and the hearing date.
2. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing to consider a recommendation to the
Governing Body as to whether the vacation should be approved or disapproved and with or
without conditions attached. At the hearing, the Planning Commission shall hear such
testimony as may be presented or as may be required in order to fully understand the true
nature of the petition and the propriety of recommending the same. If the Planning
Commission determines from the testimony presented that:
a. due and legal notice has been given;
b. no private rights will be injured or endangered;
c. the public will suffer no loss or inconvenience; and
d. in justice to the petitioner(s) the vacation should be granted;
then the Planning Commission shall recommend that such vacation be approved and
entered at length in the minutes. Such recommendation may provide for the reservation to
the City and/or the owners of any lesser property rights for public utilities, rights-of-way and
easements for public service facilities originally located in such vacated land or planned for
the future. The recommendation may be conditioned upon the petitioner's responsibility to
remove or relocate all underground or surface utilities or paving in or on the vacated land.
The petition shall not be recommended by the Planning Commission nor granted by the
Governing Body if a written objection is filed with the Clerk, at or before the hearing, by any
owner who would be a proper party to the petition, but has not joined therein. Furthermore,
when only a portion of a street, alley or public reservation is proposed to be vacated, the
petition shall not be recommended by the Planning Commission nor
10-4
granted by the Governing Body if a written objection is filed with the Clerk by any owner of
lands which adjoin the portion to be vacated. The recommendation of the Planning
Commission to the Governing Body shall be made in the same manner as provided by
K.S.A. 12-752 for the submission and approval of a final plat. (See Sections 4-107 and 108
for the 60-day time period for consideration of a plat and Section 4-110 for Governing Body
approval procedure.) The Planning Commission shall announce at their hearing when the
Governing Body will consider the recommendation on the vacation.
Following the approval of the vacation by the Governing Body in the form of an order, the
Clerk shall certify a copy of the order to the County Register of Deeds; however, such
certification shall be withheld until such time as any conditions attached to the order have
been satisfied. The Register of Deeds shall note on the recorded plat of the "townsite," i.e.,
the City, or the applicable platted addition, the words, "canceled by order" or "canceled in
part by order" and give the book and page where recorded.
B. (Inside the City only.) According to K.S.A. 14-423 and 423a, the following procedures are provided
to vacate streets, avenues, alleys or lanes, and including all or part of recorded plats, but
not to include public easements, dedicated building setback lines or access control:
1. Petitions for vacations may be accepted by the Subdivision Administrator from any person or
governmental agency. All nongovernmental petitions will be billed a processing fee. (See
Section 3-109 for Fees.) The Governing Body shall consider such vacation on its agenda
and may make inquiry to any person, staff, utility provider or governmental agency it desires
in order to determine the desirability of the vacation. No public hearing is required. If
approved, the City Clerk shall publish the effectuating ordinance. Immediately upon
publication, the City Clerk shall file a certified copy with the County Clerk to enter on the
transfer records and then record the ordinance with the County Register of Deeds. No fee
shall be charged by either office. The ordinance shall provide that the vacation shall
become effective 30 days after publication unless one or more interested parties file a
written protest with the City Clerk before the expiration time. If such a protest is made, the
Governing Body shall set a hearing date 10 days after the end of the 30-day waiting period
and the protester(s) notified. The hearing may be continued from time to time and at the
conclusion the Governing Body shall adopt a resolution confirming the vacation ordinance
and filing the same with the County Clerk and Register of Deeds as before. If the resolution
is not adopted, the vacation ordinance shall become null and void and the County Clerk and
Register of Deeds so notified. Whenever a street, avenue, alley or lane is vacated whether
in a plat or not, the same shall revert to the adjacent owners in proportion to their frontage
or proportion as to how it was acquired.
2. Prior to the initial consideration by the Governing Body, the Planning Commission shall hold a
public hearing to consider a recommendation to the Governing Body as to whether the
vacation should be approved or disapproved and with or without conditions attached. The
Commission by rule shall mail a notice at least 10 days before the hearing to all affected
utility providers, all owners of land proposed for vacation and all landowners abutting a
street, alley or easement including any segment remaining open. The petitioner(s) shall
provide a list of such landowners as required by the Subdivision Administrator including
names, addresses and zip codes.

C. (In the extraterritorial subdivision jurisdiction area only.)
According to K.S.A. 58-2613 through 2615, the following procedures are provided to vacate
streets, alleys, public easements or public reservations, e.g., building setback lines and access
control, and including all or parts of recorded plats:
1. The owners of any platted land proposed for vacation or the adjoining owners on both sides of
any street, alley, public easement or public reservation, or part thereof, may file a petition to
vacate with the Board of County Commissioners. Upon such filing, the County
Commissioners shall fix a date, time and place for a hearing and publish a notice in the official
county newspaper. At least 20 days shall elapse between the date of such
publication and the date set for the hearing. State statutes also require that notice of the
hearing be given to the City Governing Body and the Planning Commission.
If the Commissioners are satisfied at the hearing that:
a. proper notice has been given;
b. the public will suffer no loss or inconvenience; and
c. no private rights will be injured or endangered;
then the Commissioners shall order such vacation be made and entered in the minutes of
the proceedings. Such order shall protect and provide for the property rights of public
utilities, rights-of-way and easements for public service facilities in existence and use. No
such vacation shall be granted; however, if the City Governing Body protests against such
vacation. Furthermore, when only a portion of a street, alley or public reservation is
proposed to be vacated, the petition shall not be granted if a written objection is filed with
the County Clerk by any owner of land which adjoins the portion to be vacated. The Clerk
shall record a certified copy of the order with the County Register of Deeds. The petitioner
shall pay the Clerk any cost of the proceedings including publication and recording costs.
2. Prior to the above hearing by the Board of County Commissioners, the Planning Commission
shall hold a public hearing to consider a recommendation to the Governing Body as to
whether the vacation should be recommended for approval by the County Commissioners
with or without conditions attached or protested against. The Commission by rule shall mail
a notice 10 days before the hearing to all affected utility providers; all owners of land
proposed for vacation; all landowners abutting a street, alley or easement including any
segment remaining open; owners on the opposite side of the street from vacations of
setbacks and access control; and the County Engineer. The petitioner(s) shall provide a list
of such landowners as required by the Subdivision Administrator, including names,
addresses and zip codes. All nongovernmental petitioners will be billed a processing fee.
(See Section 3-109 for fees.) The Planning Commission shall announce at their hearing
10-6
when the Governing Body will consider the vacation and the date, time and place of the
County Commissioners' hearing. Unless the Governing Body deems it desirable to protest
the vacation, a resolution shall be adopted to recommend the vacation to the County
Commissioners which may or may not be subject to conditions. If conditions are required,
the City Clerk may refrain from certifying the resolution until such time as the conditions are
satisfied. After certification, the City Clerk will provide the petitioner with a copy of the
resolution to be submitted to the County Commissioners.
3. In the event that the County has designated their planning board to hold the public hearing on
the vacation, the certified resolution should be submitted for their hearing.

ARTICLE 11. APPEALS, WAIVERS AND MODIFICATIONS
100 Appeals General. The subdivider of a proposed subdivision may appeal decisions made in the
enforcement of these regulations by the Subdivision Administrator to the Planning Commission and by
the Planning Commission to the Governing Body. In the event the Governing Body sustains the
Planning Commission, the action of the Planning Commission shall be final except as otherwise
provided by law. If the Governing Body overrules the Planning Commission, the Governing Body shall
make its decision, in writing or in the minutes of the meeting, stating the reason therefore and return
such decision and plat to the Planning Commission for consideration of reapproval.
101 Appeals on Improvement Standards. Any appeal as to approval of standards or plans and
engineering drawings in connection with required improvements shall be directed to the applicable
Governing Body and that action shall be final.
102 Waiver of Required Improvements or Guarantees for Installation of Same. Any waiver of the
required improvements or guarantees for their installation may be made only by the applicable
Governing Body on a showing that such improvements are not technically feasible or necessary.
103 Modifications. In cases in which there is unwarranted hardship in carrying out the literal provisions of
these regulations as to design criteria, the Planning Commission may grant a modification from such
provision according to the following guidelines:
A. A request for a modification shall be made to the Subdivision Administrator who shall transmit it to
the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall give the subdivider and any other
interested person an opportunity to be heard with respect to the requested modification.
B. The Planning Commission shall not grant a modification unless it shall find that (1) the strict
application of these regulations will create an unwarranted hardship; (2) modification is in
harmony with the general spirit and intended purpose of these regulations; (3) the rights of
adjacent property owners will not adversely be affected; and (4) the public safety, health and
general welfare will be protected.
C. When used in this Section, the term "unwarranted hardship" shall mean the effective deprivation
of use as distinguished from a mere inconvenience.
D. Modifications permitted under the provisions of this Article shall not include modifications from the
requirements of improvement standards, required improvements or guaranteeing their installation
unless approved by the applicable Governing Body as provided for in Sections 11-101 and 102.

by these modification procedures.

ARTICLE 12. AMENDMENTS AND REVIEW
100 Amendment Procedure. These regulations may be amended at any time after the Planning
Commission shall have held a public hearing on the proposed amendment. A notice of such public
hearing shall be published once in the official city newspaper so that at least 20 days shall elapse
between the publication date and the date of such hearing. Such notice shall fix the time and place for
the hearing and shall describe such proposed amendment(s) in general terms. The hearing may be
adjourned from time to time. At its conclusion, the Planning Commission shall prepare its
recommendations and by an affirmative vote of a majority of the entire membership of the Commission
adopt the proposed amendments to these regulations and submit them, together with the written
summary of the hearing thereon, to the Governing Body. The Governing Body either may: (1)
Approve such recommendations by ordinance; (2) override the Planning Commission recommendation
by a 2/3 majority vote of the City Council; or (3) return the same to the Commission for further
consideration, together with a statement specifying the basis for the Governing Body's failure to
approve or disapprove. If the Governing Body returns the Commission's recommendations, the
Commission after considering the same, may resubmit their original recommendations giving the
reasons therefore or submit new and amended recommendations. Upon the receipt of such
recommendations, the Governing Body, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or
amend and adopt such recommendations by an ordinance, or it need take no further action thereon. If
the Commission fails to deliver its recommendations to the Governing Body following the Commission's
next regular meeting after receipt of the Governing Body's report, the Governing Body shall consider
such course of inaction on the part of the Commission as a resubmission of the original
recommendations and proceed accordingly. The amended regulations shall become effective upon
publication of the respective adopting ordinance. A copy of such legal publication shall be added to the
Appendix of these regulations.
101 Annual Review. In order to maintain these regulations, the Planning Commission shall annually hold a
public review at its regular meeting in January to consider amendments, if any, to these regulations.
Notification of such a public review may be distributed to governmental agencies and interested parties.
If amendments are deemed desirable, the amendment procedure as described in Section 12-100 shall
be followed. During the intervening period between reviews, the Subdivision Administrator shall
maintain a list of possible amendments which may be periodically brought to his or her attention.
102 Judicial Review. As provided by K.S.A. 12-760, as amended, any ordinance, regulation or decision
provided for or authorized by these regulations shall be reasonable and any person aggrieved thereby
may have the reasonableness of any decision determined by bringing an action against the City within
30 days after a final decision is made by the City. Such action shall be brought in the Sedgwick County
District Court.
