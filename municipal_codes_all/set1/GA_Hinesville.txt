PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Hinesville, Georgia. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1978 Code and ordinances adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1978 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Timothy MacMartin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Sarah R. Lumpkin for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

Sec. 2-110. - City credit card policy. 
(a)  Overview. The Georgia General Assembly enacted guidelines and penalties into the Official Code of Georgia Annotated ("O.C.G.A."), which provides that no municipal corporation shall issue government credit cards to elected officials on or after January 1, 2016, until the governing authority of the municipal corporation, by public vote, has authorized the issuance and has promulgated specific policies regarding the use of such government credit cards for elected officials of such municipal corporation. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to set requirements and standards for the City credit card program. The policy is not intended to replace current state statutes but is intended to comply with such state laws and establish more efficient guidelines for elected officials using such credit cards. At no time should a City-issued credit card ("City credit card") be used for personal purchases regardless of the circumstances. Utilizing the City credit card for personal use or for any item or service not directly related to such official's public duty may result in disciplinary action including, but not limited to, felony criminal prosecution. All purchases utilizing a City credit card must be in accordance with these guidelines and with state law. 
(c)  Scope. This credit card policy, as required by state law under O.C.G.A. § 36-80-24(c), applies to the use of City credit cards by elected officials authorized to be issued or to be utilized such City credit cards. The Mayor and City Council have been authorized by the governing authority of the City to use such City credit cards and must abide by all of the applicable state laws and this credit card policy. 
(d)  Public inspection. In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-80-24(b), any documents related to purchases using City credit cards incurred by elected officials shall be available for public inspection. 
(e)  Transaction limits. Transaction limits are hereby established to ensure compliance with state purchasing laws, maintain proper budgetary controls, and to minimize excessive use of any individual credit line. Monthly credit card transaction limits for the Mayor and City Council cannot exceed those established by the municipal governing authority. The established monthly transaction limit for the Mayor is based upon the City's budgetary constraints and is not to exceed $7,500.00 per month. The established monthly transaction limit for each City Council member is based upon the City's budgetary constraints and is not to exceed $1,500.00 per month. Any exceptions to the standardized limits must have express written approval by the municipal governing authority and must be added to this policy by amendment or addendum. 
(f)  Purchasing restrictions. 
(1)  Elected officials may not use a City credit card for the following: 
a.  Any purchases of items for personal use. 
b.  Cash refunds or advances. 
c.  Any transaction amount greater than the transaction limits set by this policy. 
d.  Items specifically restricted by this policy, unless a special exemption is granted by the municipal governing authority. 
e.  Alcohol or liquor of any kind. Such purchases should not be made with the credit card and may not be reimbursed by the City. 
f.  Purchases or transactions made with the intent to circumvent the City credit card policy, transactional limits, or state law. 
g.  Sharing the credit card or card account number with unauthorized users. This restriction shall not include providing the credit card or card account number to authorized merchants for the purpose of making and confirming reservations for accommodations and rental car usage, or other such purposes. 
(2)  Elected officials may use City credit cards to purchase goods and/or services not prohibited by this policy or state law. Such purchases include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Purchases of items for official City use which fall within the transactional restrictions of this policy. 
b.  Purchases of travel expenses while on City business, including but not limited to, lodging, fuel, food, non-alcoholic beverages, or education and training materials. 
c.  Emergency purchases necessary to protect City property. 
(g)  Ownership and cancellation of the credit card. The City credit card remains property of the issuing company. It may not be transferred to, assigned to, or used by anyone other than an authorized user of the City. Users of the credit card are accountable for the activity on the card. Users of the credit card may not make a copy of and/or keep a copy of the credit card for any purpose. Users of the credit card shall turn in the original detailed/itemized receipts for charges made while the card was in his/her possession. The issuer or the City may suspend or cancel user privileges at any time for any reason. If the user is in possession of a card, the user will surrender the credit card upon request to the City or to any authorized agent of the issuer. 
(h)  Lost or stolen credit cards. If a credit card is lost or stolen, contact the City Finance Department immediately, who will make contact with the issuer and take the appropriate steps to protect the account from unauthorized purchases. 
(i)  Administrator. The City designates the Chief Financial Officer for the city as the program administrator of City credit cards. Such administrator shall: 
(1)  Serve as a liaison between the City's cardholders and the issuers of such cards. 
(2)  Maintain the cardholder agreement for all cardholders. 
(3)  Provide instruction, training, and assistance to cardholders. 
(4)  Maintain account information and secure all cardholder information. 
(5)  Keep cardholders up-to-date on new or changing information. 
(6)  Upon receipt of information indicating fraudulent use or lost/stolen cards, immediately report it to appropriate parties, including the issuer. 
(7)  Ensure all card accounts are being utilized properly as set forth by state law and this policy. 
(8)  Define the City's policy and procedures for proper documentation and storage of receipts, logs, and approvals required under this policy. Users of the credit card shall turn in the original detailed/itemized receipts for charges made while the card was in his/her possession. 
(9)  Identify any changes to named persons authorized to use a City credit card. 
(10)  Any other duties assigned by the municipal governing authority. 
(j)  Accounting and auditing. The Administrator, in an effort to ensure compliance with City policy and state law, will conduct semi-annual reviews and audits of all city credit card transactions. The review is designed to ensure compliance, identify non-compliance issues and misuse, and through corrective measures assist the city with improving compliance. The semi-annual reviews and audits should happen within 14 days of the start of a new six month period. After completing the semi-annual audit the Administrator shall notify cardholders of any violations or questions the Administrator has that occurred within that previous month/quarter. Depending on the severity of the violation, the Administrator may suspend or revoke the use of the City credit card after notification to the cardholder and to the municipal governing authority, but only after consultation with the City attorney. Any unresolved violations should be reported to the municipal governing authority and the City attorney in writing within 14 business days. 
(k)  Violations. The authorized use of a City credit card may be suspended or revoked when the Administrator, after consultation with the City attorney, determines that the cardholder has violated the approved policies or state law regarding the use of the City credit card. The City credit card shall be revoked whenever a cardholder is removed from office with the City and shall be suspended if such elected official has been suspended from office. 
(l)  Agreement. Before being issued a City credit card under this policy and state law, all authorized users of City credit cards shall sign an agreement indicating that such user will use such cards only in accordance with the policies and ordinances of the City and with the requirements of state law.

The Adoption Agreement (and, if applicable, the Addendum) sets forth the Employees to be covered by the Plan, the benefits to be provided by the Adopting Employer under the Plan, and any conditions imposed by the Adopting Employer with respect to, but not inconsistent with, the Plan. The Adopting Employer reserves the right to amend its elections under the Adoption Agreement and any Addendum, so long as the amendment is not inconsistent with the Plan or the Internal Revenue Code or other applicable law and is approved by the Board of Trustees of GMEBS. The Adopting Employer acknowledges that it may not be able to rely on the volume submitter advisory letter if it makes certain elections under the Adoption Agreement or the Addendum. 
The Adopting Employer hereby agrees to abide by the Master Plan, Trust Agreement, and rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Trustees of GMEBS, as each may be amended from time to time, in all matters pertaining to the operation and administration of the Plan. It is intended that the Act creating the Board of Trustees of GMEBS, this Plan, and the rules and regulations of the Board are to be construed in harmony with each other. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of any of the foregoing, they shall govern in the following order: 
(1)  The Act creating the Board of Trustees of The Georgia Municipal Employees' Benefit System, O.C.G.A. Section 47-5-1 et seq. (a copy of which is included in the Appendix to the Master Defined Benefit Plan Document) and any other applicable provisions of O.C.G.A. Title 47; 
(2)  The Master Defined Benefit Plan Document and Trust Agreement; 
(3)  This Ordinance and Adoption Agreement (and any Addendum); and 
(4)  The rules and regulations of the Board. 
In the event that any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this Plan shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the previously existing provisions or the other section or sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases of this Plan, which shall remain in full force and effect, as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase so declared or adjudicated invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part hereof. The Governing Authority hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this Plan or retained the previously existing provisions if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudicated invalid or unconstitutional. 
This Adoption Agreement (and any Addendum) may only be used in conjunction with Georgia Municipal Employees Benefit System Master Defined Benefit Retirement Plan Document approved by the Internal Revenue Service under advisory letter M591996a dated March 31, 2010. The Adopting Employer understands that failure to properly complete this Adoption Agreement (or any Addendum), or to operate and maintain the Plan and Trust in accordance with the terms of the completed Adoption Agreement (and any Addendum), Master Plan Document and Trust, may result in disqualification of the Adopting Employer's Plan under the Internal Revenue Code. Inquiries regarding the adoption of the Plan, the meaning of Plan provisions, or the effect of the IRS advisory letter should be directed to the Administrator. The Administrator is Georgia Municipal Employees Benefit System, with its primary business offices located at: 201 Pryor Street, SW, Atlanta, Georgia, 30303. The business telephone number is: (404) 688-0472. The primary person to contact is: GMEBS Legal Counsel. 
Authorization for Amendments. Effective on and after February 17, 2005, the Adopting Employer hereby authorizes Ice Miller LLP, Legal Counsel, the volume submitter practitioner who sponsors the Plan on behalf of GMEBS, to prepare amendments to the Plan, for approval by the Board, on its behalf as provided under Revenue Procedure 2005-16 and Announcement 2005-37. Employer notice and signature requirements have been met for the Adopting Employer before the effective date of February 17, 2005. The Adopting Employer understands that the implementing amendment reads as follows: 
    On and after February 17, 2005, the Board delegates to the Practitioner the authority to advise and prepare amendments to the Plan, for approval by the Board, on behalf of all Adopting Employers, including those Adopting Employers who have adopted the Plan prior to the January 1, 2007, restatement of the Plan, for changes in the Code, the regulations thereunder, revenue rulings, other statements published by Internal Revenue Service, including model, sample, or other required good faith amendments (but only if their adoption will not cause such Plan to be individually designed), and for corrections of prior approved plans. These amendments shall be applied to all Adopting Employers. Employer notice and signature requirements have been met for all Adopting Employers before the effective date of February 17, 2005. In any event, any amendment prepared by the Practitioner and approved by the Board will be provided by the Administrator to Adopting Employers. 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, no amendment to the Plan shall be prepared on behalf of any Adopting Employer as of either: 
 the date the Internal Revenue Service requires the Adopting Employer to file Form 5300 as an individually designed plan as a result of an amendment by the Adopting Employer to incorporate a type of Plan not allowable in a volume submitter plan as described in Revenue Procedure 2005-16; or 
 as of the date the Plan is otherwise considered an individually designed plan due to the nature and extent of the amendments. 
    If the Adopting Employer is required to obtain a determination letter for any reason in order to maintain reliance on the advisory letter, the Practitioner's authority to amend the Plan on behalf of the Adopting Employer is conditioned on the Plan receiving a favorable determination letter. 
    The Adopting Employer further understands that, if it does not give its authorization hereunder or, in the alternative, adopt another pre-approved plan, its Plan will become an individually designed plan and will not be able to rely on the volume submitter advisory letter.

The provisions of this paragraph establish only the minimum requirements of academy entrance examinations for Peace Officer candidates in this State; each law enforcement unit is encouraged to provide such additional requirements and any preemployment examination as it deems necessary and appropriate. 
(c)  Bond and oath. Prior to entering upon the duties of their respective offices, all officers of the Police Department shall take and subscribe the oath prescribed by the Mayor and Council. 
(d)  Duties. It shall be the duty of the officers of the Police Department to acquire a full knowledge of and to enforce all of the ordinances of the City and all statutes applicable therein, to become familiar with the rules and regulations established by the Chief of Police concerning the discipline, good order, proper conduct, care, and management of the Police Department, and to respect and obey all orders of the Chief of Police not in conflict with the law or ordinances of the City. 
(e)  Conduct. Every member of the Police Department shall conduct himself in a proper and law-abiding manner at all times and shall avoid the use of unnecessary force. Prohibited conduct shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  Absence from regular hours of duty without permission;

Any one or more of said penalties may be imposed in the discretion of the City Council. 
(g)  Arms and uniforms. Each officer and member of the Police Department shall be furnished with such uniform, arms, and police equipment as provided for by the City Council. Uniforms shall be kept clean and pressed and shall be worn on duty at all times, unless otherwise ordered by a superior officer. The equipment, arms and uniforms furnished by the City shall be and always remain the property of the City and shall be, when a change is ordered or on retirement from office, returned to the City. The members of the Police Department shall be liable on their bonds for any loss or careless destruction of or damage to their arms and uniforms. 
(h)  Arrests. Police Officers of the City may make arrests for violations of municipal ordinances and State laws when such violations are committed in their presence or when they have obtained a valid arrest warrant from the Judge of the Municipal Court or from some other proper authority. In exercising such power of arrest, all Police Officers shall see that all necessary warnings are given to the accused as required by law. 
Note- The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that whenever a person is deprived of his freedom in any significant way by the police, he is entitled by law to the following warnings: That he has a right to remain silent; that any statement he makes can and will be used as evidence against him in a court of law; that he has the right to consult with an attorney and have him present during interrogation; and that if he can be imprisoned for the offense and cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent him prior to any questioning. Neither the nature of the offense nor the nature of the penalty will affect a citizen's right to these warnings if he is in fact deprived of his freedom in some significant way. The consequence of the failure to give such warnings will be suppression in court of any self-incriminating statements made by the defendant. See Miranda v. Arizona , 384 U.S. 436, and Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25. Obstructing or hindering a law enforcement officer in the lawful discharge of his official duties is a misdemeanor. Resistance with violence is a felony. (See O.C.G.A. § 16-10-24.) For an in-depth treatment of the subject of criminal arrest, see "Criminal Arrest in Georgia: A Manual for Peace Officers" (Athens: Institute of Government, University of Georgia, 1974). 
(i)  Entering private dwellings. No Police Officer shall enter a private dwelling without a search or arrest warrant unless he is in pursuit of a fugitive whom the officer has personal knowledge or probable cause to believe has committed or attempted to commit a felony. 
(j)  Disposition of stolen, abandoned, or impounded property. 
(1)  All personal property which comes into the custody of the Police Department, where said property has been stolen or impounded or where the ownership is unknown, shall be held for a reasonable period awaiting claim by its owner. The owner of said property, upon proving ownership and paying all expenses and costs, including reasonable charges for storage, shall have the right to have such property returned to him. 
(2)  If after the expiration of the period, the property is unclaimed, the Chief of Police shall advertise the property for sale in the newspaper in which the City's legal advertisements are printed. Such advertising shall take place at least ten days before the date set for the sale and shall give a description of the property to be sold and specify the time and place of sale. If the property is still unclaimed by the time of the sale, it shall be sold as advertised and the proceeds shall be placed in the City treasury.

    Nothing in this section shall be deemed to curtail the power of the Municipal Court to judicially punish violations of State law or local ordinances.

(a)  Electrical. Type NM or NMC. Types NM and NMC cables shall not be used in any building or structure except in any dwelling not exceeding three floors abovegrade. 
(b)  Wetlands protection. 
(1)  Definitions . For the purpose of this subection, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
    Jurisdictional wetlands means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
    Jurisdictional wetlands determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended. 
    Regulated activity means any activity that will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
    Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. The term "wetlands" shall include, but not be limited to, swamps, marshes, bogs and such other areas supporting hydrophytic vegetation. 
    Wetland delineation means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended. 
    Wetlands inventory area means wetlands identified on the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) map for Liberty County, Georgia. A wetlands inventory area does not necessarily represent jurisdictional wetlands and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetland delineation. 
    Wetlands map means the United States Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps (as amended) for the City of Hinesville, Georgia. 
    Wetlands protection district means all wetlands located within the jurisdiction of City of Hinesville, Georgia as indicated on the wetlands map; provided, however, that the wetlands map does not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the City of Hinesville and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetlands boundaries established by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. 
(2)  When wetlands assessment required. This subsection is intended to provide applicants for a building permit or a demolition permit with notice when the proposed activity may require a Department of the Army permit due to the impact upon jurisdictional wetlands. The provisions in subsection (b)(3) of this section shall not apply if the applicant can provide to the Zoning Administrator a valid U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wetland delineation that verifies that the proposed activity is not located within jurisdictional wetlands, or if the applicant can provide a valid U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit or letter that authorizes the proposed activity within jurisdictional wetlands. If such evidence of compliance with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permitting requirements is provided, the Zoning Administrator shall follow normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a demolition permit. 
(3)  Wetlands assessment. Prior to the issuance of a building permit or a demolition permit the Zoning Administrator shall assess whether the proposed activity is of a type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands and, if so, shall also assess whether the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area. To assess whether the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, the Zoning Administrator shall consult the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) map for Liberty County. 
a.  If the Zoning Administrator determines that the proposed activity is of a type that could not result in a disturbance of wetlands or if the proposed activity is not located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, the Zoning Administrator shall follow normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a demolition permit. 
b.  If the Zoning Administrator determines that the proposed activity is of a type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands and that the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional wetland determination shall be required prior to issuance of a building permit or a demolition permit. If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that a Department of the Army permit is required, a building permit or a demolition permit shall be issued only following issuance of the Department of the Army permit. If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that the proposed activity would not require a Department of the Army permit, the Zoning Administrator shall proceed with normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a demolition permit. 
c.  Wetlands inventory areas as identified above and defined in this section do not necessarily represent jurisdictional wetlands within Liberty County and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetlands delineation. No permit issued pursuant to these regulations relieves a landowner from Federal or State permitting requirements. 
(4)  Corps of Engineers determination. A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required prior to the issuance of a permit for any regulated activity within the Wetlands Protection District. If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that wetlands are present and that a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, no permit for the regulated activity will be issued until the permit or letter of permission is obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Should the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determine that there are no wetlands present on the proposed development site, the City of Hinesville may proceed with its normal permitting procedures. 
(5)  Compliance with State and Federal requirements. Any action taken by the City of Hinesville under this section does not relieve a landowner from adhering to all Federal and/or State permitting requirements.

A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the technical codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the Director of Inspections from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the technical codes. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the work is commenced. One or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 90 days each, may be allowed for the permit. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Extensions shall be in writing by the Director of Inspections. 
(b)  Permit issued on basis of an affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the Director of Inspections, are hazardous or complex, the Director of Inspections shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the Director of Inspections written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the technical codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are approved by the Director of Inspections. 
(c)  Plans. When the Director of Inspections issues a permit, he shall endorse in writing or by stamp both sets of plans, "Reviewed for Code Compliance." One set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the Director of Inspections and the other set shall be returned to the applicant.

In cases where the Commission deems it necessary, it may hold a public hearing concerning the application. Notice of the hearing shall be published in the principal newspaper of local circulation and written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the Commission to all owners and published notice shall be provided in the same manner and time frame as notices are provided before a public hearing for rezoning. The Commission shall give the property owner and/or applicant an opportunity to be heard at the certificate of appropriateness hearing. 
(f)  Acceptable Commission reaction to applications for certificate of appropriateness. The Commission may approve the certificate of appropriateness as proposed, approve the certificate of appropriateness with any modifications it deems necessary, or reject it. The Commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change(s) in appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. The Commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historical, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the Commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance; architectural style; general design, arrangement, texture, and material of the architectural features involved; and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style and pertinent features of other structures in the immediate neighborhood. In making this determination, the Commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the following criteria for each of the following acts: 
(1)  Reconstruction, alteration, new construction or renovation. The Commission shall issue certificates of appropriateness for the above proposed actions if those actions conform in design, scale, building material, setback and landscaping as further specified in the design guidelines for the City, and to the Secretary of the Interior's standards for rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings. 
(2)  Relocation. A decision by the Commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the relocation of a building, structure, or object shall be guided by: 
a.  The historic character and aesthetic interest the building, structure or object contributes to its present setting; 
b.  Whether there are definite plans for the area to be vacated and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area will be; 
c.  Whether the building, structure or object can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity; 
d.  Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the building, structure, site, work of art or other object. 
(3)  Demolition. A decision by the Commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of buildings, structures, sites, or objects shall be guided by: 
a.  The historic, scenic or architectural significance of the building, structure, site, or object; 
b.  The importance of the building, structure, site, or object to the ambiance of a district; 
c.  The difficulty or the impossibility of reproducing such a building, structure, site, or object because of its design, texture, material, detail, or unique location; 
d.  Whether the building, structure, site, or object is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood or the County; 
e.  Whether there are definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be; 
f.  Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the building, structure, site, or object from collapse; 
g.  Whether the building, structure, site, or object is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value. 
(g)  Undue hardship. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this article would result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of any specific property, the Commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions or to interpret the meaning of the provision so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided, however, that such variance, modification, or interpretation shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variations, the Commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will in its judgment best fulfill the purpose of this article. 
(h)  Deadline for approval or rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. The Commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within 45 days after the filing thereof by the owner or occupant of a historic property or of a structure, site, or work of art located within a historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the Commission. Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by United States mail to the applicant and all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the Commission. Failure of the Commission to act within such 45 days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
(i)  Action to be taken by Commission upon rejection of application. In the event the Commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The Commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the Commission shall be binding upon the Building Inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
(j)  Requirement of conformance with certificate of appropriateness. All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. The City Council or the Historic Preservation Commission shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in appearance of a designated historic property or historic district, except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of this article, or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic property or historic district. 
(k)  Certificate of appropriateness void if construction not commenced. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless work requested pursuant to such certificate is commenced within six months of date of issuance. Certificates of appropriateness shall be issued for a period of 18 months and are renewable. In the event such work requires a building permit, such work shall be deemed to have commenced on the date of issuance of such permit. 
(l)  Exemptions. The State Department of Transportation and any contractors, including cities and counties, performing work funded by the State Department of Transportation are exempt from this article. Additionally, the City is exempt from the requirement of obtaining certificates of appropriateness; provided, however, that the City shall notify the Commission 45 days prior to beginning an undertaking that would otherwise require a certificate of appropriateness and allow the Commission an opportunity to comment. 
(m)  Recording of applications for certificate of appropriateness. The Commission shall keep a public record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness, and of all the Commission's proceedings in connection with such application, such applications to be maintained in the office of the Community Development Department. 
(n)  Acquisition of property. The Commission may, where such action is authorized by the City Council and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange, or otherwise, of the property or any interest therein, such negotiations to be ratified by the City Council. 
(o)  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the Commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the City Council in whose historic preservation jurisdiction the property in question is located; and such City Council may approve, modify and approve, or reject the determination made by the Commission if the City Council finds that the Commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. The ordinances adopted in conformity with O.C.G.A. § 44-10-26 shall specify the procedures for the review of decisions of the Commission by the City Council involved. Appeals from decisions of the City Council made pursuant to this article may be taken to the Superior Court in the manner provided by law for appeals from a conviction for City or County ordinance violations.

(a)  Ordinary maintenance or repair. Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural or environmental feature in or on a historic property to correct deterioration, decay or damage, or to sustain the existing form, and that does not involve a material change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof, does not require a certificate of appropriateness. 
(b)  Failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. Property owners of historic properties within historic districts shall not allow their buildings to deteriorate by failing to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. The Commission shall be charged with the following responsibilities regarding deterioration by neglect:

Such conditions as broken windows, doors and openings which allow the elements and vermin to enter, and the deterioration of a building's structural system shall constitute failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. 
(2)  In the event that the Commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the Commission will notify the owner of the property and set forth the steps that need to be taken to remedy the situation. The owner of such property will have 30 days in which to do this. 
(3)  In the event that the condition is not remedied in 30 days, the owner will be subject to penalty as provided in section 5-256. 
(c)  Annexation of existing building and zoning codes. Nothing in this article shall be construed as to exempt property owners from complying with existing City building and zoning codes, or other applicable State and Federal laws, nor to prevent any property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.

    Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure (note: accessory structures are not exempt from any article requirements)). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be: 
(1)  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or 
(2)  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
    This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
    For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include: 
(1)  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, and which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Sec. 5-277. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 2008-02, § I, 9-4-2008; Ord. No. 2018-04, § I, 12-6-2018) 
Sec. 5-278. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

Sec. 5-311. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The Mayor and City Council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  Requests for appeals or variance from the requirement of this article shall first be heard by the Board of the LCPC. The LCPC Board shall then forward their recommendations for approval or denial of the appeal or variance to the Mayor and City Council for final decision. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Mayor and City Council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Liberty County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the Mayor and City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article, and: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(8)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(9)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(h)  Conditions for variances. 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The City Manager or his/her designee shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of the article, the LCPC Board may recommend special conditions and the Mayor and Council may attach such special conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 5-310(7). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved: (1) on individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, and (5) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, must be elevated to either: 
1.  Where base flood elevation data are available, the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
2.  Where base flood elevation data are not available, the manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. This standard shall in addition be consistent with applicable State requirements. 
b.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (see subsection 5-341(6)). 
c.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections 5-342(3)a. and c. 
(4)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-281 are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. 
Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.  Only if subsection (4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
c.  The placement of any manufactured home, except in an existing manufactured home park or existing manufactured home subdivision is prohibited.

ARTICLE VII. - WETLANDS AND GROUNDWATER RECHARGE PROTECTION 
DIVISION 1. - WETLANDS PROTECTION 

Sec. 5-376. - Wetlands protection. 
(a)  Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
    Jurisdictional wetlands shall mean an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
    Jurisdictional wetlands determination shall mean a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended. 
    Regulated activity shall mean any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
    Wetland shall mean an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands shall include but not be limited to swamps, marshes, bogs and such other areas supporting hydrophytic vegetation. 
    Wetland delineation shall mean a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended. 
    Wetlands inventory area shall mean wetlands identified on the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) map for Liberty County, Georgia. A wetlands inventory area does not necessarily represent jurisdictional wetlands and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetland delineation. 
    Wetlands map shall mean the United States Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps (as amended) for the City of Hinesville, Georgia. 
    Wetlands protection district shall mean all wetlands located within the jurisdiction of City of Hinesville, Georgia as indicated on the wetlands map; provided, however, that the wetlands map does not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the City of Hinesville and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetlands boundaries established by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. 
(b)  When wetlands assessment required. This section is intended to provide applicants for a building permit or a demolition permit with notice when the proposed activity may require a Department of the Army permit due to impact upon jurisdictional wetlands. The provisions in subsection (c) of this section shall not apply if the applicant can provide to the zoning administrator a valid U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wetland delineation that verifies that the proposed activity is not located within jurisdictional wetlands, or if the applicant can provide a valid U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit or letter that authorizes the proposed activity within jurisdictional wetlands. If such evidence of compliance with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permitting requirements is provided, the zoning administrator shall follow normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a demolition permit. 
(c)  Wetlands assessment. Prior to the issuance of a building permit or a demolition permit the zoning administrator shall assess whether the proposed activity is of a type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands and, if so, shall also assess whether the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area. To assess whether the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, the zoning administrator shall consult the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) map for Liberty County. 
(1)  If the zoning administrator determines that the proposed activity is of a type that could not result in a disturbance of wetlands or if the proposed activity [is] not located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, the zoning administrator shall follow normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a demolition permit. 
(2)  If the zoning administrator determines that the proposed activity is of a type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands and that the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional wetland determination shall be required prior to issuance of a building permit or a demolition permit. 
a.  If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that a Department of the Army permit is required, a building permit or a demolition permit shall be issued only following issuance of the Department of the Army permit. 
b.  If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that the proposed activity would not require a Department of the Army permit, the zoning administrator shall proceed with normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a demolition permit. 
c.  Effect of wetlands assessment. Wetlands inventory areas as identified above and defined in this section do not necessarily represent jurisdictional wetlands within Liberty County and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetlands delineation. No permit issued pursuant to these regulations relieves a landowner from federal orstate permitting requirements. 
(d)  A United States Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required prior to the issuance of a permit for any regulated activity within the Wetlands Protection District. If the United States Army Corps of Engineers determines that wetlands are present and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, no permit for the regulated activity will be issued until the permit or letter of permission is obtained from the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Should the United States Army Corps of Engineers determine that there are no wetlands present on the proposed development site, the City of Hinesville may proceed with its normal permitting procedures. 
(e)  Any action taken by the City of Hinesville under this section does not relieve a landowner from adhering to all federal and/orstate permitting requirements.

DIVISION 2. - GROUNDWATER AREA RECHARGE PROTECTION 

Sec. 5-391. - Title, findings and objectives. 
(a)  Title. This division shall be known as the Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of the City of Hinesville, Georgia. 
(b)  Purpose. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the City, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the City relies on as a source of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
(c)  Objectives. The objectives of this division are as follows: 
(1)  Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
(2)  Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and 
(3)  Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality. 
(Code 1978, § 6-62; Ord. No. 2000-4, § 1, 6-15-2000; Ord. No. 2000-9, § I, 1-4-2001) 
Sec. 5-392. - Definitions. 
    Aquifer means any stratum (layer of sedimentary rock) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
    Determination of pollution susceptibility means that each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Said map is hereby adopted and made a part of this division. 
    DRASTIC means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings as set forth in the United States Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035, as amended, and incorporated herein. 
    Groundwater recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
    Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to pollution from chemical spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in a recharge area. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has assigned groundwater recharge areas a pollution susceptibility rating of high, medium or low based on its Hydrologic Atlas 20, Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility, Map of Georgia. 
    Pollution susceptibility map(s) means maps prepared by the DNR that show relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution based on the DRASTIC methodology. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the State of Georgia into areas having high medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
    Significant groundwater recharge areas means those areas mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of groundwater recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density or lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of karst topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces. 
(Code 1978, § 6-63; Ord. No. 2000-4, § 1, 6-15-2000; Ord. No. 2000-9, § I, 1-4-2001) 
Sec. 5-393. - Criteria in significant groundwater recharge areas. 
    The following criteria shall apply in significant groundwater recharge areas as identified in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition) within the incorporated areas of the City of Hinesville. Not withstanding the criteria in this code section, it is the policy of the City to have all new construction/development connect to City sanitary sewer if reasonably available. The replacement of existing septic tank/drain field systems will not be approved if City sanitary sewer is available within 200 feet of the developed property. 
(1)  All new above ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks having a minimum volume of 660 gallons shall be equipped with a secondary containment facility capable of holding a minimum of 110 percent of the volume of such above ground storage tank or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Above ground storage tanks used for agricultural purposes shall be exempt from this subsection, provided, however, the above ground storage tank is in compliance with all applicable federal rules and regulations. 
(2)  New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within: 
a.  A high pollution susceptibility area; 
b.  A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15-acre-feet in size; or 
c.  A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50-acre-feet in size. 
As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5×10 -7 cm/sec or such other criteria as established by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. 
(3)  New homes served by a septic tank/drain field system shall be on lots having minimum size limitations as follows, based on application of Table MT-1 of the DHR Manual (hereinafter DHR Table MT-1). The minimums set forth in Table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in Sections A-F) of the DHR Manual. 
a.  One hundred fifty (150) percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
b.  One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; 
c.  One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. Any lot of record on the date of the adoption of this section (June 15, 2000) shall be exempt from the minimum lot size requirements of this subsection. Where a conflict exists between the minimum lot size requirements of this subsection and the minimum lot size requirements of the City of Hinesville zoning ordinance, the conflict shall be resolved in favor of the provision that establishes the larger minimum lot size. 
(4)  New mobile home parks served by septic tank/drain field systems shall have lots or spaces having minimum size limitations as follows, based on application of Table MT-2 of the DHR Manual (hereafter DHR Table MT-2). The minimums set forth in Table MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in Sections A-F) of the DHR Manual. 
a.  One hundred fifty (150) percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
b.  One hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; 
c.  One hundred ten (110) percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
Any lot of record on the date of the adoption of this section (June 15, 2000) shall be exempt from the minimum lot size requirements of this subsection. Where a conflict exits between the minimum lot size requirements of this subsection and the minimum lot size requirements of the City of Hinesville zoning ordinance, the conflict shall be resolved in favor of the provision that establishes the larger minimum lot size. 
(5)  No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank unless the Liberty County Health Department first approves the proposed septic tank installations as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Human Resources for On-Site Sewage Management (hereafter DHR manual), and sections 6-64(c) and (d) above. 
(6)  New facilities that handle hazardous materials of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and local fire code requirements. 
(7)  Permanent stormwater infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility.

Sec. 6-6. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The City is subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life or property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damages. 
(c)  Increased velocities and quantities of water draining off developed land cause erosion, sedimentation, and maintenance problems resulting in significant damages. 
(Code 1978, § 6-27; 1991-06, § 23-102, 9-19-1991) 
Sec. 6-7. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, wetlands, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; 
(6)  Control erosion and sediment problems resulting from the development process and increased urban runoff from developed land. 
The Council further declares its intent that these public policies be evaluated periodically so as to reflect the community's interest in protection of the natural environment and to give direction to City actions in matters affecting the natural environment and land development.

ARTICLE III. - DRAINAGE CONTROL 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 6-36. - Statement of policy objectives. 
    The enactment and enforcement of this article is intended to address the following policy objectives: 
(1)  To recognize the necessity of and to encourage joint action and a full exchange of information by the City and the development industry in resolution of existing drainage problems, the prevention of their worsening or recurrence and the implementation of these objectives. 
(2)  To work in a cooperative relationship with the development industry to accomplish the above stated objective by encouraging through this article and other public actions the development of on-site self-maintaining retention/detention facilities and for off-site centrally located regional retention/detention facilities. 
(3)  To maintain, where feasible, the natural environment of City streams through reduction of flow quantities resulting from new development and, where feasible, restore the floodplain to its natural functional purpose to resolve existing flooding problems, but recognize the necessity of using urban streams for storm water runoff in those situations where maintenance of the natural stream environment would result in continuation or worsening of flooding conditions. 
(4)  To incrementally assume maintenance responsibility for the public drainage system. 
(5)  To require of the development industry the responsibility to maintain the functioning of the storm drainage system. 
(6)  To encourage the construction of joint retention/detention ponds serving several properties which can be accepted for maintenance by the City upon completion of project development. The City encourages (where engineering judgment so warrants) the location of these retention facilities off the site of the property under development and may participate in the construction of major retention facilities which would serve not only the needs of the property under development, but would assist in resolving existing flooding problems. 
(7)  To encourage innovative design solutions to the effective retention and reduction of runoff. Drainage control measures to retain, reduce and regulate the rate of storm water discharge which shall be acceptable shall include, but need not be limited to, retention/detention ponds, percolation facilities, parking lots, open space areas, and oversized storm drains with restricted outlets. In addition, the City encourages the development of retention facilities in such a manner that they will become aesthetically and recreationally beneficial to the community in which they are located. 
(8)  To encourage the use of the drainage engineering techniques found in the comprehensive drainage study for the City. 
(9)  To require any development where the overall runoff coefficient exceeds six-tenths to retain any increase in runoff caused by the development and to utilize the parking area or privately owned retention/detention facility. 
(10)  To encourage development/redevelopment in the Downtown Development District by providing off-site regional retention capacity for property located inside the Downtown Development District.

Secs. 6-52-6-60. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - DRAINAGE DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS 

Sec. 6-61. - Standards. 
(a)  The goals and objectives contained in the latest edition of the Coastal Stormwater Supplement to the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (CSS), and any relevant local addenda, will be followed in design of storm water systems. 
(1)  CSS Compatibility with other regulations: This section 6-61(a) is not intended to interfere with, modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this ordinance should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this section imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
(b)  All engineering design items for storm water and delineation of the 100-year floodplains shall meet the applicable minimum requirements available from the Director of Inspections. Rainfall intensities used in hydrologic computations shall not be less than shown by applicable rainfall curves published by the national weather service for the affected area. 
(c)  A combination of storage and controlled release of storm water runoff shall be required for all development and construction which will increase the peak rate of runoff from the site by more than one cubic foot per second for a 25-year frequency (type II) storm. This shall not apply to individual single-family lots of less than two acres. Areas identified in the Downtown Development (D-D) zone must have their site evaluated for storm water drainage requirements by the Director of Inspections. 
(1)  The Downtown Development District is comprised of four distinct drainage basins. By providing regional detention capacity and adequate conveyance capacity for parcels within the district, these parcels may be able to reduce the amount of on-site detention required, during development and/or redevelopment. The Downtown Development District will be defined as all parcels interior to the boundary created by General Stewart Way, General Screven Way, and Oglethorpe Highway. 
(2)  As downstream conveyance capacity is improved the Downtown District Drainage Basins Map shall be amended to reflect the changes to the areas of available conveyance capacity. Minor infrastructure improvements to choke points in Basins 3C-3F could allow for inclusion in Basin 3A, where detention and conveyance capacity may be available. 
(d)  The release rate of storm water from all developments where retention is required shall not exceed the peak storm water runoff rate from the area in its existing state for all intensities up to and including the 25-year frequency for all durations of rainfall. 
(e)  The drainage system being developed shall have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a type II, 24-hour, storm of 25-year design for frequency except for areas considered to be major drainage canals. The major drainage canals shall have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of 100-year frequency. 
(f)  Land uses within the 100-year floodplain shall not diminish or restrict the capacity of the channels or floodplains of the stream, its tributaries, drainage ditches or any other drainage facilities or systems and shall not increase the 100-year elevation or velocity or concentration of flow in downstream areas. If the required hydrologic studies reveal that a request for filling or grading within the 100-year floodplain would overload the capacity of the channel downstream or increase flood stages upstream, the development permit shall be denied unless equivalent flow and storage capacity is replaced and maintained by the owner within the 100-year floodplain. Altered sections of the 100-year floodplain shall have a positive slope so as to provide positive drainage back to the stream flow line, and this section must be maintained by the owners in perpetuity so as to prevent or remove silt buildup. 
(g)  The live retention storage to be provided shall be calculated on the basis of the 25-year frequency rainfall as published by the national weather service for the affected areas. The retention system required shall be that necessary to handle the runoff of a 25-year rainfall, for any and all durations from the proposed development, with a release rate that does not exceed the predevelopment runoff. Retention control structures and other drainage improvements shall be designed to prevent erosion damage to adjacent property owners. Retention/detention control structures shall be sized for the release rate as presented in previous sections and will have provisions for overflow of the 100-year storm without damage to the structure. 
(h)  When the developer requests and the Director of Inspections determines, upon the advice and consent of the public works director that development and construction projects are too small, or that engineering and economic factors make combined retention or other drainage facilities more practical, the City may authorize the joint construction of these facilities to serve two or more properties by two or more developers. This authorization shall be granted by the City Manager upon application for approval being submitted through the Director of Inspections. Where joint retention facilities serving two or more properties are approved for construction, no use of land or occupancy of buildings within the properties served by these facilities shall be permitted until completion of the retention facility, except upon approval of the City Manager. 
(i)  When adequacy of existing drainage structures is being considered in association with proposed development, the overall capacity of the structure will be evaluated and divided among upstream properties. The available capacity will be divided among property owners based on acreage in the basin. Under no condition will the available capacity of the structure be exceeded. Should the developer desire to replace the structure in lieu of retention/detention, all downstream structures should be evaluated and deemed adequate. 
(j)  The following requirements shall apply to the installation, development and maintenance of all stormwater management facilities designed for temporary storage of stormwater runoff: 
(1)  Required storage facilities shall be designed and graded with a 3:1 slope or flatter to a depth of six feet or must be enclosed by permanent chain link fencing at least six feet in height. This fencing shall be designed, installed and maintained to allow the free flow of runoff and sediment (if intended) into the facility. The fence shall include a lockable gate of sufficient size to permit entrance of equipment necessary to allow periodic maintenance activities. Different fencing material may be substituted for chain link upon approval of the building official. 
(2)  To provide access for maintenance of proposed facilities designed with a 2:1 slope, such facilities shall have a minimum additional 20-foot flat top easement for maintenance purposes. Required maintenance easements for facilities designed with flatter slopes will be evaluated on a case by case basis. Facilities shall be located on tracts of land, designated for this use on the recorded plat, with sufficient area around the perimeter to provide access for maintenance purposes and shall be immediately adjacent to or be provided with an access easement to a public street. The access easement shall provide at least 20 feet of width outside of aboveground obstructions including trees, headwalls, weirs, settling basins or other drainage structures. 
(3)  Perforated standpipes or a french drain, as approved by the Director of Inspections, or other methods which will achieve equal performance to prevent standing of water and/or inadequate drainage shall be installed within all these facilities. 
(4)  Except as provided in subsection (j)(5), the property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of these retention facilities during grading, construction, and following final approval of the completed project. This maintenance obligation shall be binding on future owners, successors and assigns of the property. 
(5)  In the case of single-family residential subdivisions approved after September 19, 1991, the City shall assume maintenance responsibility two years after the release of subdivision streets. A special drainage district as authorized by 1972 Ga. Laws, page 1552 is established for property in a single-family residential subdivision at the time the plat is finally recorded and will be so noted on the plat. Upon completion of developer maintenance, all detention ponds shall have a positive slope to the outlet in order to facilitate complete drainage. 
(6)  These facilities in single-family residential subdivisions constructed under permits issued prior to September 19, 1991, will not be accepted for City maintenance unless individually approved and accepted by the City Council and suitable access easements are provided. At the time the City Council accepts a retention facility for City maintenance, a special drainage district may be established that includes all properties for which the retention facility is designed. 
(7)  Pursuant to the creation of special drainage districts by the City as authorized by 1972 Ga. Laws, page 1552, revenues to fund City maintenance of retention facilities may be obtained by an ad valorem tax on all properties for which the retention facilities are designed. Such ad valorem millage rates may be set annually by the City Council when other ad valorem millage rates are set. No assessment will be made in a special drainage district in the calendar year in which it is established. 
(8)  If a retention/detention basin is included in the design, then a sediment indicator will be installed in that basin. The indicator will be made of treated lumber with a minimum dimension of five inches with a length equal to the total height of water and sediment plus four feet for burial. The indicator will be installed in the bottom of the basin with the top at the maximum water surface, and a 3/25-inch deep notch around the circumference of the indicator at the maximum elevation of the sediment storage. 
(k)  All buildings located adjacent to or in the 100-year floodplain shall be constructed in accordance with the City flood damage prevention code. 
(l)  Special drainage system maintenance requirements: 
(1)  No impoundment of water which retains in excess of 0.5 acre feet of runoff shall be removed without first obtaining a development permit, which shall only be issued after competent engineering studies provided by the developer show that this removal will not adversely affect downstream properties. 
(2)  Trash, garbage, construction materials, construction byproducts or other debris shall not be deposited in any part of the drainage system. 
(3)  No restrictions or barriers, including fences, may be placed in the drainage system without first obtaining a development permit. When on- or off-site debris has accumulated within a floodplain in such manner as to interfere with the free flow of water so as to increase the risk of hazardous inundation of upstream properties adjacent to the floodplain, the public works director shall require the owner of the property where this debris was generated, if its source can be identified, to clear and remove the debris so as to permit the free flow of water. 
(m)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
(n)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
(o)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(p)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.

DIVISION 2. - REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 6-121. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 6-121(b) and (c). The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES General Permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements of best management practices. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 6-121(b) and (c) shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (2) or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a Local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a Local Issuing Authority or issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The Director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections 6-121 (b) and (c), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion. 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum. 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential. 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented. 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum. 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable. 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development. 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable. 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-1 et seq. 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the surface of fills. 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property. 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners. 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, are kept to a minimum. 
(14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control or of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2). 
(15)  Except as provided in subsection (16), there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all State waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity, to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines, or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any State waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed. 
(17)  Land disturbing activities shall not be conducted within the 100-year floodplain unless compliance with any applicable local floodplain management ordinance is demonstrated or such construction is in compliance with the Federal Emergency Management Agency regulations or flood storage compensation for floodwaters is provided. 
(18)  Comprehensive construction sequencing plan. A comprehensive construction sequencing plan is created during the preconstruction stage. This plan describes the sequence of each construction activity and phase. It allows for the coordination of simultaneous operations and planning of the activity sequence while taking the opportunity to consider different equipment and strategies. A comprehensive construction sequencing plan should address items such as the timing of the installation of sediment basins and installation of erosion control structures and devices. This plan must be submitted prior to the issuance of a land disturbing activity permit as part of the construction site plan or as a separate document as needed. 
(19)  On-site construction site waste management plan. Prior to obtaining a land disturbing activity permit, a plan to prevent pollution and manage construction site waste must be prepared and approved by the governing authority. Construction site operators will control waste at the construction site, such as discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter, and sanitary waste. The plan must include the following items: 
a.  Waste receptacle locations (construction and permanent). 
1.  Used to store unwanted litter, and discarded building materials. 
2.  Dumpster containers for putrescible or leachable waste shall have lids or covers that can be placed over the container prior to rainfall. 
3.  All trash and construction debris from the site will be deposited in the waste receptacle. Waste collection shall occur before the containers overflow. 
4.  The waste disposal company will be a licensed solid waste management company and shall meet all local and any State solid waste management regulations. 
b.  Hazardous waste receptacles. If a land disturbing activity identifies, contains, proposes or otherwise includes any hazardous waste, the manufacturer's guidance will be followed for the containment of these materials. This hazardous waste must be disposed of on a regular basis and in the appropriate manner according to the guidelines of the manufacturer. Hazardous waste is defined as any solid, liquid, or contained gaseous materials which are no longer used and, if not handled or disposed of properly, could damage or pollute the land, air, or water. They can also cause injury or death to exposed individuals. A waste is hazardous if it exhibits one or more, but not limited to, the following characteristics: 
1.  Ignitability. Ignitable vapors can create fires under certain conditions. Examples include liquids, such as solvents that readily catch fire, and friction sensitive substances. 
2.  Corrosivity. Corrosive wastes include those that are acidic and those that are capable of corroding metal, such as tanks, containers, drums, and barrels. 
3.  Reactivity. Reactive wastes are unstable under normal conditions. They can create explosions and/or toxic fumes, gases, and vapors when mixed with water. 
4.  Toxicity. Toxic wastes are harmful or fatal when ingested or absorbed. When toxic wastes are disposed of on land, contaminated liquid may drain from the waste and pollute ground water. 
c.  On-site construction refueling stations or refueling areas. 
1.  All refueling stations or refueling areas shall comply with Rules of Safety Fire Commissioner, Chapter 120-3-11, Rules and Regulations for Flammable and Combustible Liquids and other applicable codes and regulations. 
2.  A refueling area shall be designated on the plans for refueling any construction equipment. The plan must include precautions and actions that must be implemented to prevent the release of hazardous pollutants into the environment. 
3.  Construction sites will have equipment on-site or on-board maintenance fueling vehicles to contain and clean up petroleum spills. 
4.  If petroleum products are stored on-site, a fuel storage facility must be provided and approved. All on-site fuel storage facilities will be monitored for leaks and receive regular preventative maintenance to reduce the chance of leakage. The plan should identify petroleum storage facilities and address inspections and maintenance. 
5.  All fuel products shall be stored in tightly sealed containers that are clearly labeled. 
6.  Petroleum products will be stored in covered areas, where possible. 
7.  If the on-site refueling station is to be used for a period greater than two years, it will be considered as a permanent fueling station subject to site plan review and approval. 
d.  On-site construction chemical storage. 
1.  Chemicals will be stored in a dry covered area. Chemical storage containers should be located in a retaining (diked) area, not exposed to precipitation or stormwater. 
2.  Each site that has a chemical storage facility where flammable and combustible chemicals are stored must ensure that storage tanks and venting systems are equipped with all necessary safeguards to prevent chemical leaks into the atmosphere or explosion. 
e.  Concrete washout location. Excess residue and contaminants from washing down equipment such as, but not limited to, concrete trucks, pumps, mixers, chutes, hand tools, and wheelbarrows containing or having contained concrete should be contained in an area that prevents contact between these residues and contaminants, and stormwater that will be discharged from the site. After excess concrete and wash water has hardened, they should be disposed of properly. 
f.  On-site construction sanitary waste disposal units. 
1.  All construction sites are required to have on-site sanitary waste disposal units. 
2.  The developer/contractor should ensure servicing of sanitary waste disposal units on a regular basis. 
g.  All on site waste disposal systems, storage facilities, washout locations, and refueling stations shall be in proper working condition as soon as practicable. On site waste disposal systems, storage facilities, washout locations, and refueling stations shall be located to avoid impairments to them or contamination from them during the land disturbing activity. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any Local Issuing Authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection (b)(2). 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2010-07, § I, 6-17-2010; Ord. No. 2015-03, § 1, 8-6-2015) 
Sec. 6-122. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  Generally the property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The Local Issuing Authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit.

(1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority without first obtaining a permit from the LCPC to perform such activity. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to LCPC and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c). Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the Division, regardless of the existence of a Local Issuing Authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the Local Issuing Authority shall refer the application and plan to the District for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The District shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the District to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the District review shall be forwarded to the Local Issuing Authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the District, and any variances required by subsections 6-121(b)(16) and (17) and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(5) of this section have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the Local Issuing Authority and the District have entered into an agreement which allows the Local Issuing Authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The Local Issuing Authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised Plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the Local Issuing Authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised Plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the Local Issuing Authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)  The Local Issuing Authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the Local Issuing Authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the Local Issuing Authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 6-121 or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article and this chapter.

ARTICLE VI. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

Sec. 6-296. - Stormwater utility established. 
    There is established a stormwater utility to be known as the "City of Hinesville Stormwater Utility," which shall be responsible for stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the City, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of the City's stormwater management services, systems and facilities. 
(Ord. No. 2007-05, § 6-146, 12-7-2006) 
Sec. 6-297. - Purpose. 
    The City is authorized by the state constitution, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs II and III(a)(6) thereof and state law, to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the City, which services, systems and facilities contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare, and protection of the natural resources of the City of Hinesville. The Federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 USC 1251 et seq.), other amendments and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act, place increased emphasis on the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and making available to its citizens and property owners stormwater management services which address water quality and volume impacts of stormwater runoff. The City Council has determined that development in the City to date, and development in the future, has created and will continue to create additional needs for stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the City. The City has engaged a consultant to perform a Stormwater Utility Feasibility Study of the City's stormwater management needs and the alternatives available to the City for dealing with stormwater management, and has received, reviewed and considered the results of the consultant's analyses which identify stormwater management needs, propose strategic program goals and priorities, estimate the cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities, examine reasonable charges by the City for providing such services and facilities and project the rate base available within the City to support such costs. The City Council finds and concludes from the Stormwater Utility Feasibility Study that it would be desirable to provide for additional stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the City. The City Council finds and concludes from the Stormwater Utility Feasibility Study that a fair and equitable rate structure for those owners of developed property in the City receiving the benefits of stormwater management services, systems and facilities, the proceeds of which will be dedicated to the City stormwater utility for carrying out its purposes, will be essential if the City is to provide the level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities that would be desirable to meet the existing and future stormwater management needs of the City. 
(Ord. No. 2007-05, § 6-143, 12-7-2006) 
Sec. 6-298. - Findings. 
    The City Council makes the following findings of fact: 
(1)  The City is authorized by the state constitution, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs II and III(a)(6) thereof and state law to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the City. 
(2)  The management of stormwater and other surface water discharges within and beyond the City is a matter that affects the health, safety and welfare of all residents and businesses in the City. 
(3)  Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten to potentially damage businesses and residences, and other facilities and may create environmental damage to the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within and adjacent to the City. 
(4)  A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the City and surrounding areas. 
(5)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the operations of sanitary sewer operated by the City by, among other things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. 
(6)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the further degradation of the water quality in area waterbodies which may result in higher levels of treatment requirements being imposed on the City's wastewater treatment facilities. 
(7)  The Federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 USC 1251 et seq.) (the "Act"), and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act imposed by regulatory obligations of its national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit require the City to reduce pollution in its stormwater discharge and increase water quality to the maximum extent practicable. 
(8)  Proper management of stormwater is a key element of having clean water with adequate assimilative capacity for treated wastewater discharges and adequate potable drinking water that are essential to support existing and future development in the City. The City has two rivers and streams listed as impaired waters by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, or other appropriate authorities pursuant to Section 303(d) of the Act. 
(9)  Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES permit will substantially increase the cost of stormwater management above that which is currently spent for drainage and flood control. 
(10)  The cost of operating and maintaining the City stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. 
(11)  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the City hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility and establish rates for stormwater management services. 
(12)  In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, the City is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the Charter of the City to provide for stormwater collection and disposal (Ga. Const. art. IX, § II, ¶ III(a)(6)). 
(13)  The City fully incorporates by reference into these findings the Stormwater Utility Feasibility Study, said document is on file in the Office of the City Manager. 
(14)  The Stormwater Utility Feasibility Study conducted on behalf of and submitted to the City assesses and defines the stormwater management issues, needs, goals, program priorities and operational opportunities of the City. 
(15)  Given the issues, needs, goals, priorities and operational opportunities identified in the Stormwater Utility Feasibility Study submitted to the City, the City determines to establish a stormwater utility within the City that is dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in the City in concert with other water resource management programs. 
(16)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the City. Development in the City has altered the natural hydrology with some natural elements having been replaced or augmented by manmade facilities. Even areas of the City that remain less densely developed and rural in character with natural stormwater drainage predominating, demand services along roads where ditches and culverts have been installed. As a result, stormwater management services systems and facilities needs apply to all areas of the City. 
(17)  The stormwater needs in the City include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Provision of stormwater management services, systems, facilities and regulation of their use renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents of City, and to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the City concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the Stormwater Utility Feasibility Study. 
(18)  The service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including, but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed upon the stormwater management services, systems and facilities, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of properties in proportion to the longterm demands the properties owned impose on the City's stormwater management services, systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof. 
(19)  The City presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed, installed and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the City, and of future additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the City to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance the stormwater management systems and facilities in the City in concert with the management and regulation of other water resources in the City. In order to do so, the City must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management services, systems and facilities. 
(20)  A stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the City, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in the City through stormwater management charges, user fees and other mechanisms as described more fully herein. 
(21)  A schedule of stormwater utility management charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the City. Such charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the City Council. 
(22)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which significantly reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the City's stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the service charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and that such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the City and as set forth herein. 
(23)  The area of impervious surfaces on each property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services, systems and facilities provided by the City or to be provided by the City in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating periodic Stormwater Management Charges. 
(24)  In addition to impervious area, the amount and types of pollutants that are carried by stormwater runoff is closely tied to the use of the property. Sampling of stormwater runoff from across the United States has demonstrated that the runoff from the more heavily used property, such as commercial and industrial developments, contain greater quantities of pollutants than less intensely developed residential properties. The water quality component of the City's stormwater program will concentrate more heavily in those areas where the land use of the properties generates the greatest quantity of pollutants which may be reflected in the stormwater quality charge of those properties. 
(25)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all charges for stormwater management services, systems and facilities, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems and facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and the Council directs that such proceeds of charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the City stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be disbursed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2007-05, § 6-144, 12-7-2006)

    Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 USC 1251 et seq.), as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto. 
    Base charge means a charge to all developed property based on the customer's fair share of the annual costs of those program elements needed to manage and maintain the basic drainage system and comply with the general requirements of the stormwater permit. The base charge is based on the ERU methodology. 
    Credit means a reduction in the amount of the stormwater service charge to the owner of a particular parcel for privately owned, maintained and operated on-site or off-site stormwater systems or facilities, or activities that reduce or mitigate the City stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities. 
    Customer of record means the customer in the City's utility billing system as receiving one or more municipal services other than stormwater. 
    Developed property means a parcel that has been altered from its natural state by the addition of any improvement, such as a building, structure or other impervious surface with a footprint greater than 660 square feet and where a certificate of occupancy has been issued, or upon completion of construction or final inspection if no such certificate is issued; or where construction of an improvement is at least 50 percent complete and construction is halted for a period exceeding three months. Developed property includes but is not limited to, transient rentals (such as hotels and motels), single-family and other residential properties including duplex, triples, and multifamily apartment buildings or condominiums, commercial or industrial developments, institutional schools, hospitals and churches, Federal, State, and local governmental properties, and parking parcels. 
    Director means the City Manager or his designees. 
    Duplex mean a detached residential structure containing two dwelling units, designed for occupancy by not more than two families living independent of each other. Duplexes shall be treated by the stormwater utility in the same manner as single-family properties. 
    Equivalent runoff unit (ERU) means the statistical average horizontal impervious area of a single-family property between 1,884 and 3,743 square feet of impervious area within the City as of the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived.

Secs. 9-108-9-130. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE V. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT 

Sec. 9-131. - Findings; public purpose. 
(a)  Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Garden Grove, California and Warner-Robins, Georgia, whose experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the City; and based on the documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by a law enforcement professional and deposition evidence by experts in sociology, who are familiar with conditions resulting in other localities, at the Mayor and City Council hearing on September 6, 2007; and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before members of the City Mayor and City Council on other occasions, including the public hearing conducted on or about November 21, 1996, and on documentary evidence submitted to the Mayor and City Council, the Mayor and City Council takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country. 
(b)  It is the finding of the Mayor and City Council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or video graphic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
(c)  Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. The Mayor and City Council finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the City, as well. 
(d)  Furthermore, it is the finding of the Mayor and City Council that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities. 
(e)  The Mayor and City Council finds that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments upon the City are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities. The Mayor and City Council therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's day care facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the Mayor and City Council finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The board finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, the ordinance from which this article is derived is hereby adopted.

Secs. 12-40-12-68. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - OFFENSES INVOLVING PUBLIC HEALTH 

Sec. 12-69. - Smoking in public facilities. 
(a)  Findings and intent. The City Council does hereby find that: 
(1)  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to 65,000 Americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (NCI), "Health Effects of Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke: the Report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 10," Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI), August 1999.) 
(2)  The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen. (Environmental Health Information Service (EHIS), "Environmental tobacco smoke: first listed in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Public Health Service, National Toxicology Program, 2000.) 
(3)  Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and cancer. (California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA), "Health Effects of Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke," Tobacco Control 6(4): 346-353, Winter, 1997.) 
(4)  The Americans With Disabilities Act, which requires that disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability. (Daynard, R.A., "Environmental Tobacco Smoke and the Americans with Disabilities Act," Nonsmokers' Voice 15(1): 8-9.) 
(5)  The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke. (Department of Health and Human Services. The Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking: A Report of the Surgeon General. Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, 1986.) The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels by high rates of ventilation. Air cleaners, which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke. (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "Indoor Air Facts No. 5: Environmental Tobacco Smoke," Washington, D.C.: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), June 1989.) 
(6)  A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled offices suffer a 25-50 percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas, J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., "Association Between Exposure To Environmental Tobacco Smoke and the Development of Acute Coronary Syndromes: the CARDIO2000 Case-Control Study," Tobacco Control 11(3): 220-225, September 2002.) 
(7)  Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke. ("The High Price of Cigarette Smoking," Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
(8)  Accordingly, the City Council finds and declares that the purposes of this section are to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in all public facilities in the City; to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air; and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Dining area means any enclosed area containing a counter or tables upon which food or snacks are served.

    Employer means a person, business, partnership, association, corporation, including a municipal corporation, trust, or non-profit entity that employs the services of one or more individual persons. 
    Enclosed means all space between a floor and ceiling that is enclosed on all sides by solid walls or windows (exclusive of doorways), which extend from the floor to the ceiling. 
    Health care facility means an institution providing care or treatment of diseases, whether physical, mental, or emotional, or other medical, physiological, or psychological conditions, including, but not limited to, hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals or other clinics, nursing homes, homes for the aging or chronically ill, and laboratories. This definition shall include all waiting rooms, hallways, private rooms, semiprivate rooms, and wards within health care facilities. 
    Place of employment means an area under the control of a public employer that employees normally frequent during the course of employment, including, but not limited to, work areas, employee lounges, restrooms, conference rooms, meeting rooms, classrooms, employee cafeterias, hallways, and vehicles.

Sec. 12-167. - Nude entertainment prohibited in establishments that serve alcohol. 
(a)  Public purpose. 
(1)  Based upon the demonstrated experience of other counties and municipalities, including but not limited to, Austin, Texas, and Garden Grove, California, which experience is found to be relevant to the problems that face the City, and based upon documentary evidence and oral testimony made available by citizens and other interested persons, many of whom are familiar with conditions resulting in the City and in other localities, at a public hearing held November 21, 1996, and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before members of the City Council on other occasions, the Mayor and City Council of the City take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country, particularly the problems of crime, blight, and deterioration which are brought about by the combination of alcohol and live nudity. 
(2)  It is the finding of the City that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or adult entertainment (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. 
(3)  Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, public indecency, prostitution and drug trafficking and drug use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this section, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of similar establishments in particular areas. 
(4)  The City, therefore, finds that to promote the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community, it is necessary and expedient to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of live nude entertainment and alcohol. The City finds that such action promotes the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including, but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this section is adopted.

    Specified sexual activities means and shall include any of the following:

(4)  Nothing in this subsection shall apply to or prohibit traditional or live theater, as defined in this section. 
(d)  Penalty for violation. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation or by imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both. In addition to such fine and/or imprisonment, violation of this section shall also be grounds for suspension, revocation or nonrenewal of the business license issued by the City to such offending business. 
(e)  Unlawful operation; declared nuisance. Any business operated, conducted or maintained contrary to the provisions of this section shall be and the same is hereby declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance.

ARTICLE VI. - OFFENSES INVOLVING UNDERAGE PERSONS 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 12-219. - Juvenile curfew. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Emergency means an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for immediate action. The term includes, but is not limited to, a fire, natural disaster, or automobile accident, or any situation requiring immediate action to prevent serious bodily injury or loss of life. 
    Establishment means any privately owned place of business operated for a profit to which the public is invited including, but not limited to, any place of amusement or entertainment. 
    Juvenile or minor means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 or, in equivalent phrasing often herein employed, any person 17 or less years of age. 
    Operator means any individual, firm, association, partnership, or corporation operating, managing, or conducting any establishment. The term includes the members or partners of an association or partnership and the officers of a corporation. 
    Parent means any person having legal custody of a juvenile: 
(1)  As a natural or adoptive parent; 
(2)  As a legal guardian; 
(3)  As a person who stands in loco parentis; or 
(4)  As a person to whom legal custody has been given by court order. 
    Public place means any place to which the public or a substantial group of the public has access and includes, but is not limited to, streets, common areas of schools, hospitals, apartment houses, office buildings, shopping centers, parking lots, parks, playgrounds, transportation facilities, theatres, restaurants, shops, bowling alleys, taverns, golf courses, billiard rooms, cafes, arcades, and similar areas that are open to the use of the public. As a type of public place, a street is a way or place, of whatever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for the purpose of vehicular travel or in the case of a sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel. The term "street" includes that legal right-of-way, including but not limited to the roadway of traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. 
    Remain means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily in a public place including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four or more persons in which any juvenile involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home, or to fail to leave the premises of an establishment when requested to do so by a Police Officer or the operator of an establishment. To implement this provision with additional precision and precaution, numerous exceptions are expressly defined in this section. More and more exceptions become available with a juvenile's increasing years and advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation. 
    Serious bodily injury means bodily injury that causes death or creates a substantial risk of serious permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss of impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ. 
    Time of night means and is based upon the prevailing standard of time generally observed at that hour by the public in the City; prima facie the time then observed in the City administrative offices and police station. 
    Years of age means and continues from one birthday, such as the 16th to (but not including the day of) the next, such as the 17th birthday, making it clear that 17 or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase "under 18 years of age," the latter phrase in practice, unfortunately, having confused a number of persons into the mistaken thought that 18 year olds might be involved. Similarly, for example, 11 or less years of age means "under 12 years of age." 
(b)  Curfew for juveniles. It shall be unlawful for any person 17 or less years of age (under 18) to be or remain in or upon a public place within the City during the time period beginning at 11:00 p.m. on any Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday until 5:30 a.m. on the following day, and beginning at 11:59 p.m. on any Friday or Saturday until 5:30 a.m. on the following day. 
(c)  Exceptions. 
(1)  The following shall constitute valid exceptions to the operation of the section: 
a.  When a juvenile is accompanied by a parent of such juvenile; 
b.  When a juvenile is accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such juvenile to take said parent's place in accompanying said juvenile for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area; 
c.  When the juvenile is on an errand as directed by the juvenile's parent until the hour of 12:30 a.m.; 
d.  When a juvenile is exercising first amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right of assembly, by first delivering to the person designated by the City's Chief of Police to receive such information a written communication, signed by the juvenile and countersigned, if practicable, by a parent of the juvenile with their home address and telephone number, specifying when, where and in what manner the juvenile will be in a public place during hours when the section is applicable to said minor in the exercise of a first amendment right specified in such communication; 
e.  In case of reasonable necessity for the juvenile remaining in a public place but only after the juvenile's parent has communicated to the person designated by the City's Chief of Police to receive such notifications the facts establishing the reasonable necessity relating to a specified public place at a designated time for a described purpose including points of origin and destination. A copy of the communication, or of the police record thereof, duly certified by the person designated by the Chief of Police to be correct, with an appropriate notation of the time it was received and of the names and addresses of the parent and juvenile, shall be admissible evidence; 
f.  When a juvenile is on the sidewalk or property where the juvenile resides, or on either side of or across the street from the place where the juvenile resides and the adult owner or resident of that property has given permission for the juvenile to be there; 
g.  When a juvenile is returning home by a direct route (without any unnecessary detour or stop) from and within one hour of the termination of a school activity or an activity of a religious or other voluntary association, or a place of public entertainment, such as a movie, play or sporting event. If the event is not commercial in nature or does not have a fixed, publicly known time at which it will or does end, the sponsoring organization must register the event with the person designated by the Chief of Police at least 24 hours in advance, informing the Police Department of the time that such event is scheduled to begin, the place at which it shall be held, the time at which it shall end, and the name of the sponsoring organization; 
h.  When authorized, by special permit from the Chief of Police carried on the person of the juvenile thus authorized, as follows. When necessary nighttime activities of a juvenile may be inadequately provided for by other provisions of this section, then recourse may be had to the Chief of Police, either for a regulation as provided below or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant. Upon the findings of a reasonable necessity for the use of a public place to the extent warranted by a written application signed by a juvenile and by a parent of the juvenile, if feasible, stating: 
1.  The name, age and address of the juvenile; 
2.  The name, address, and telephone number of a parent thereof; 
3.  The height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other physical characteristics of the juvenile; 
4.  The necessity that requires the juvenile to remain upon a public place during the curfew hours otherwise applicable; 
5.  The public place; and 
6.  The beginning and ending of the period of time involved by date and hour. 
The Chief of Police may grant a permit in writing for the juvenile's use of a public place at such hours as in the opinion of the Chief of Police may be reasonably necessary and consistent with the purposes of this section. In an emergency it is not required but it is recommended that it be handled by telephone or other effective communication, with a corresponding record being made contemporaneously to the Chief of Police or to the person designated by the Chief of Police to act on behalf of the Chief of Police in an emergency, at the police station, or by calling 911 and reporting the emergency; 
i.  When authorized, by regulation issued by the Chief of Police in other similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to reasonably necessary night-time activities of more juveniles than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the Chief of Police permitting use of public places shall be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the public places permitted, the period of time involved not to extend more than one hour beyond the time for termination of the activity, and the reason for finding that the regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this section; 
j.  When the juvenile is legally employed and carries a certified card of employment, renewable each calendar month when the current facts so warrant, dated or re-issued not more than 45 days previously, signed by the Chief of Police and briefly identifying the juvenile, the addresses of the juvenile's home and of the juvenile's place of employment, and the juvenile's hours of employment; 
k.  When the juvenile is, with parental consent, engaged in normal interstate travel through the City or originating or terminating in the City; 
l.  When the juvenile is married or has been married or has had disabilities of minority removed pursuant to State law; or 
m.  In the case of an operator of any establishment, when the operator has notified the Police that a juvenile was present on the premises of the establishment during curfew hours and refused to leave. 
(2)  Each of the foregoing exceptions, and their several limitations such as provisions for notification, are severable, as hereinafter provided but here reemphasized, and will be considered by City Council when warranted by future experience illuminated by the views of student government associations, school personnel, citizens, associations, parents, officers and persons in authority concerned positively with juveniles as well as with juvenile delinquency. 
(d)  Parental responsibility. It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a juvenile knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to allow the juvenile to remain in any City public place under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of this section. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a juvenile in that parent's legal custody. This requirement is intended to hold a neglectful or careless parent up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall, therefore, be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such juvenile. 
(e)  Operator responsibility. It shall be unlawful for any operator of an establishment to knowingly permit a juvenile to remain at the establishment under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of this section. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that an operator should reasonably be expected to have concerning the patrons of the establishment. The standard for "knowingly" shall be applied through an objective test: whether a reasonable person in the operator's position should have known that the patron was a juvenile in violation of this section. 
(f)  Enforcement procedures. 
(1)  If a Police Officer reasonably believes that a juvenile is in a public place in violation of the section, the officer shall notify the juvenile of the violation of this section and shall require the juvenile to provide the juvenile's name, address and telephone number and how to contact the juvenile's parent or guardian. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate, State identification card, driver's license or military dependent identification card, a Police Officer shall, in the first instance of violation of this section, use the Police Officer's best judgment in determining age. 
(2)  The Police Officer shall issue the juvenile a written warning that the juvenile is in violation of this section and order the juvenile to go promptly home. The Chief of Police shall send the parent or guardian of the juvenile written notice of the violation pursuant to this subsection. 
(3)  Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience and may provide that the Police Officer may deliver to a parent or guardian thereof a juvenile under appropriate circumstances; for example, a juvenile of tender age, near home, whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or are known. 
(4)  Notwithstanding subsection (f)(2) of this section, when: a juvenile has received one previous written warning for violation of this section; or a Police Officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the juvenile has engaged in delinquent conduct, the procedure shall then be to take the juvenile to the police station where a parent or guardian shall immediately be notified to come for the juvenile whereupon the parent or guardian and the juvenile shall be questioned. This is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to centralize responsibility in the person designated there and then on duty for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording, thus, making available experienced personnel and access to information and records. 
(5)  When a parent or guardian, immediately called, has come to take charge of the juvenile, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the juvenile shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located or fails to take charge of the juvenile, then the juvenile shall be released to the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the juvenile may temporarily be entrusted to an adult, neighbor or other person who will on behalf of a parent or guardian assume the responsibility of caring for the juvenile pending the availability or arrival of a parent or guardian. 
(6)  In the case of a first violation of this section by a juvenile, the Chief of Police shall by certified mail send to a parent or guardian written notice of the violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of this section, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties. 
(7)  For the first violation of this section by an operator of an establishment who permits a juvenile to remain on the premises, a Police Officer shall issue a written notice of the violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of this section, including enforcement of operator responsibility and of applicable penalties. 
(8)  In any event the Police Officer shall, within 24 hours, file a written report with the Chief of Police or shall participate to the extent of the information for which the Police Officer is responsible in the preparation of a report on the curfew violation. It is not the intention of this subsection to require extensive reports that will prevent Police Officers from performing their primary police duties. The reports shall be as simple as is reasonably possible and may be completed by Police Department personnel other than sworn Police Officers. 
(g)  Penalties. 
(1)  If, after the warning notice pursuant to subsection (f) of this section of a first violation by a juvenile, a parent violates subsection (d) of this section (in connection with a second violation by the juvenile), this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. For the first offense by a parent, the parent shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00, and for the second offense by a parent, the parent shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00, imprisonment for not more than ten, or both fine and imprisonment, and for the third or subsequent offense by a parent, the parent shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00, imprisonment for not more than 60 days, or both fine and imprisonment. Any parent who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Except as otherwise provided each violation of this section shall constitute a separate offense. 
(2)  The parent or legal guardian having custody of a juvenile subject to this section shall be liable for all costs incurred by the City for providing personnel to remain in the company of a juvenile who has been detained as a curfew violator if the parent or guardian does not pick up the juvenile within one hour after receiving notice from the City that the City is detaining the juvenile for a curfew violation. The amount to be paid by the parent or guardian shall be based on the hourly wage of the City employee who is assigned to remain with the juvenile plus the cost of benefits for that employee. 
(3)  Any juvenile who shall violate any of the provisions of the section more than three times shall be reported by the Chief of Police to the juvenile authorities as a juvenile in need of supervision and the Chief of Police may proceed to file such charges with the juvenile court as he may deem appropriate. 
(4)  If, after the warning notice pursuant to subsection (f) of this section of a first violation of the section by a 17 year old juvenile, a 17 year old juvenile violates any of the provisions of the section, this shall be treated as a first offense by the 17 year old juvenile. For the first offense by a 17 year old juvenile, the 17 year old shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00, and for a second offense the 17 year old shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00, imprisonment not to exceed ten days, or by both fine and imprisonment, and for a third or subsequent offense the 17 year old shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00, imprisonment not to exceed 60 days, or by both fine and imprisonment. A 17 year old who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Except as otherwise provided each violation of this section shall constitute a separate offense. 
(5)  If, after the warning notice pursuant to subsection (f) of this section of a violation of the section, an operator of an establishment violates subsection (d) of this section a second time, this shall be treated as a first offense by the operator. For the first offense by an operator, the operator shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00, and for a second offense the operator shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00, imprisonment not to exceed ten days, or by both fine and imprisonment, and for a third or subsequent offense the operator shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00, imprisonment not to exceed 60 days, or by both fine and imprisonment. Any operator who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Except as otherwise provided each violation of this section shall constitute a separate offense. In addition for the first or any subsequent offense, the operator may be subject to having administrative adverse action taken by the Mayor and City Council against the operator's business license, such adverse action to include but not limited to suspension and/or termination of the operator's business license. 
(h)  Construction and severability. 
(1)  Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of this section. If any provision, including any exception, part, phrase, or term, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the application to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and the validity of the section in any and all other respects shall not be affected thereby. 
(2)  The City Manager, after consultation with the City Attorney, is hereby authorized to give advisory opinions in writing, which shall be binding and shall be adhered to by the police, until this section is amended in such respect, interpreting terms, phrases, parts or any provisions. Normally such advisory opinions shall be in response to good faith, signed letters addressed to the City Manager or to the Mayor or a member of the City Council, questioning the curfew ordinance as: ambiguous; having a potentially chilling effect on constitutional rights specifically invoked; or otherwise invalid, in all three categories with respect to proposed conduct definitely described. This administrative remedy must be exhausted prior to presenting to any court a question in any of the three categories. The Mayor and City Council do not intend a result through the enforcement of this section that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable. The Mayor and City Council intend that this section be held inapplicable in such cases, if any, where its application would be unconstitutional under the Constitution of the State of Georgia or the Constitution of the United States of America. 
(i)  Continuing evaluation. The Mayor and City Council shall continue its evaluation and updating of this section through methods including but not limited to: 
(1)  Within six months after the implementation of this section, the Chief of Police shall provide the Mayor and City Council with a report concerning the effect of this section on crimes committed by and against minors, and of the number or warnings issued and arrests of minors, parents, and operators hereunder, and such other information as the City Council may request; and 
(2)  On a regular basis, the Mayor and City Council shall receive informal reports of all exceptional cases hereunder of reasonable necessity, the notices of school and other activities, the special permits and the regulations authorized above, and the advisory opinions for consideration by the City Council in further updating and continuing evaluation of the section. 
(j)  Notice. Notice of the existence of this section and of the curfew regulations established by it shall be posted in, on or about such public or quasi-public places as may be determined by the City Manager or the Police Department in order that the public may be constantly informed of the existence of this section and its regulations.

If the permit is denied, the Chief of Police shall provide the applicant in writing a statement of the reasons therefore. (First class mail to the address provided by the applicant, postmarked no more than ten working days after receipt of the fully completed, executed, and filed application, shall be sufficient for this purpose, though not the exclusive means of notice.) 
(b)  Nothing in this process shall prevent the Chief of Police, at his sole option and within the ten working day period for approval or denial, to confer with the applicant with respect to modifications of the applicant's plan for the event, and amend the application to reflect such modifications if agreed to by the applicant. However, the applicant may neither supplement nor amend its application within said ten working day period except at the invitation of the Chief of Police. Any attempt to do so shall automatically be deemed a separate and new application. 
(c)  The Chief of Police may deny the application for a permit upon any of the following reasons or combination of reasons: 
(1)  The application does not contain all required information or materials, or the information set out in the application is so incomplete, vague, or ambiguous as to prevent full and proper review by the Chief of Police;

(6)  The applicant or entity represented by the applicant has on prior occasions violated permitting ordinances in connection with events of a substantially similar nature; 
(7)  The plan of the event as proposed is likely to present a danger to the health or safety of participants in the event or other members of the public (though not through the agency of any predicted reaction by onlookers or members of the public); 
(8)  The plan of the event as proposed is likely to restrict and/or congest traffic (vehicular or pedestrian) on any of the public roads, rights-of-way, sidewalks, or waterways in the immediate vicinity of such event; 
(9)  The plan of the event as proposed is likely to cause a disturbance of the peace, or is likely to burden lawful commerce in the area at the time of the proposed event, or is likely to intrude upon the privacy or property of citizens in the area of the proposed event; 
(10)  The plan of the event as proposed includes activities which are prohibited by laws of the United States, the State of Georgia, or ordinances of the City, or activities which constitute a nuisance or tortious conduct with respect to public or private property or persons;

(12)  The plan of the event as proposed is prohibited by or is inconsistent with the classifications and uses of the proposed or desired location; 
(13)  A fully executed prior application for permit has been or will be granted to a prior applicant authorizing uses or activities which do not reasonably permit multiple occupancy of that particular space; or

(d)  It is the specific intent of the City in enacting this article to regulate only the time, place and manner of events and not to regulate the content or message of any speech or expressive conduct. The factors enumerated above, which the Mayor and City Council finds expresses and supports the substantial and compelling interests of the City in the preservation of the rights and liberties of its citizens and the safety, health, and good order of its society, are the only bases upon which the Chief of Police shall decide to issue or deny a permit applied for hereunder and no such decision shall be made or justified based upon the anticipated or predicted content of the speech or expressive conduct of any applicant.

(f)  It shall be unlawful for any person or group of persons who have been permitted to conduct an event to remain on the permitted location or facility, after an event, permitted or otherwise, has been terminated pursuant to this section.

    Canopy trees are defined as large preferred trees which provide canopy over streets and sidewalks and other paved areas. Upon reaching maturity, a canopy tree will achieve a canopy spread of in excess of 40 feet in diameter. Using a radius of 20 feet for calculation purposes, the canopy cover area for one mature tree will be equal to 3.1416 × 20 2 or 1,257 square feet. Total canopy coverage for one acre of land would be equal to 43,560 divided by 1,257 which equals 35 large canopy trees. 
    Critical root zone means the minimum area surrounding a tree that is considered essential to support the viability of the tree and is for purposes of this chapter equal to the diameter at breast height in inches (DBH) converted into the radius of the circular area in feet around a preserved tree. 
    Development means the act, process, or state of erecting buildings or structures, or making improvements to a parcel or tract of land. 
    Developable acre(s) is/are the land area(s) that can potentially be developed, i.e. this area does not include environmentally sensitive areas including but not limited to wetlands, stream buffers, marshlands, etc. 
    Diameter breast height (DBH) means the diameter or width of the main stem of a tree as measured four and one-half feet above the natural grade at its base. Whenever a branch, limb, defect, or abnormal swelling of the trunk occurs at this height, the DBH shall be measured at the nearest point above or below four and one-half feet at which a normal diameter occurs. 
    Exceptional tree means any tree designated, as provided for in this chapter, to be of notable historic interest, aesthetic value, or of unique character because of species, type, age or size. 
    Fifty percent canopy cover means a canopy expected to be achieved over a 30-year period by the planting of large, preferred trees or the retention of existing canopied trees which result in a minimum of 50 percent cover across the City/County. Fifty percent canopy cover will be approximately 18 large, preferred trees per acre, quantified as 1,600 tree quality points per acre. 
    Greenspace means any area retained as permeable unpaved ground and dedicated on the site plan to supporting vegetation. 
    Greenspace plan means a map and/or supporting documentation which describes for a particular site where vegetation (greenspace) is to be retained or planted in compliance with these regulations. The greenspace plan shall include a tree survey, tree establishment plan, and/or a tree protection plan, and a landscape plan. 
    Landscape plan means a map and supporting documentation which describes for a particular site where vegetation is to be retained or provided in compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The landscape plan shall include any required buffer elements. 
    Landscape quality point means a unit of measurement which quantifies the relative value of small trees, shrubs, and ground cover which are planted or retained on a given site. 
    Native tree means any tree species which occurs naturally and is indigenous within the region.

    Sketch plan means a conceptual layout for a subdivision as specified in the subdivision regulations. 
    Species diversity means a planting or retention of diverse tree species on a site or within the community to prevent dominance by any single type of tree. The purpose of this diversity is to prevent the destruction of the entire urban forest in the event of disease or pestilence. For any site of one acre or larger, no more than 45 percent of trees and shrubs planted shall be of the same species. 
    Tree easement means an easement not less than ten feet in width and not in conflict with any other planning requirements under the zoning and subdivision regulations for public planting and/or maintenance of canopy street trees exclusive of utility, drainage, or other easements. Administrative approval is required for easements greater than ten feet in width. 
    Tree establishment plan means a map and supporting documentation which describes for a particular site where existing trees are to be planted in compliance with the requirements of these regulations, the types of trees and their corresponding tree quality points. 
    Tree fund means the tree protection escrow fund established to receive funds paid in lieu of required tree quality points or for compensation for damage or removal of trees owned by the governing authority. 
    Tree protection plan means a map and surrounding documentation which describes for a particular site where existing trees are to be retained in compliance with the requirements of these regulations, the types of trees, and their corresponding tree quality points. 
    Tree protection zone means the area surrounding a preserved or planted tree that is essential to that tree's health and survival, and is protected within the guidelines of these regulations. The minimum tree protection zone required for retained trees is the tree diameter's inches (DBH) converted into feet of radius around the tree. For planted trees, see table. 
    Tree quality point (TQP) means a unit of measurement which quantifies the relative value of trees that are planted or retained on a given site. Tree quality points quantitatively express the desirable qualities of the species with regards to size for each tree that is retained on a site. For planted trees, tree quality points are an expression of species desirability and the expected mature size of each tree. 
    Tree survey. A tree survey shall be in the form of a map or site plan prepared and sealed by a registered land surveyor within two years of the date of application. The survey shall be at the same scale as the required site development plan and shall include the following information: 
The location of all trees 16 inches or greater within the limits of disturbance and 25 feet beyond in each direction or to the property line whichever is less.

Sec. 17-31. - Design requirements. 
(a)  Commercial, industrial, institutional, and multifamily development. 
(1)  Applicability. Except as provided in this chapter, a greenspace plan shall be submitted for all proposed commercial, industrial, or multifamily development. Such plan shall include a tree survey, tree protection, tree establishment and landscape plan. Such plans shall conform to the standards and requirements of these regulations. 
(2)  Greenspace standards. 
a.  A minimum of 20 percent of the total land area of the development shall be devoted to greenspace. 
b.  Sidewalks, curbing, or any other paved or impermeable surfaces within the greenspace shall not count towards the 20 percent minimum greenspace requirement. 
c.  For all sites of one acre or larger, no more than 45 percent of trees planted shall be of the same species in order to increase species diversity. 
d.  Existing groups of trees shall be retained wherever possible. 
(3)  Locations for planting/preserving trees and landscaping. 
a.  Street trees. Street trees may be planted or preserved within the front yard development setback; provided, they can be placed within a tree easement established pursuant to the provisions of the subdivision regulations, and such tree does not conflict with any existing utility, drainage or other easements. 
b.  Front yard development setback. Understory and canopy trees may be preserved and/or planted in this area. A portion of the 400 landscape quality points/acre may be planted in this area. 
(4)  Parking areas. 
a.  A minimum of 1,200 tree quality points per acre of the parking area in canopy trees shall be planted and/or preserved within landscaped islands and medians located between parking bays. Landscape quality points may also be planted in these areas. 
b.  Canopy trees planted in parking islands shall have 400 square feet of unpaved soil for root development. The standard tree island shall be 20 feet by 20 feet; provided, however, that where the islands are an extension of a ten-foot wide landscape median, the islands may be reduced in width to 16 feet. Islands shall not be separated by more than 12 parking spaces, including the landscaped ends of the drive aisles. Islands shall be designated so as to minimize foot traffic across them. 
c.  The parking island requirement may be altered to minimize conflicts with lighting or to accommodate innovative design provided that total area of unpaved area and number of trees is maintained. 
(5)  Buffers. Existing and/or planted canopy, understory trees, and planted evergreen shrubs may be incorporated into buffer areas. Such planting shall be credited for quality points provided that other standards and requirements of the chapter are met. 
(6)  Landscaping standards. 
a.  Landscape quality points requirement. The required 400 landscape quality points per acre shall be provided through the planting of small/medium trees, shrubs, vines, and/or groundcover 
b.  Locations for landscape quality points. Such plantings may be located in the following areas: 
1.  Front yard development setback. 
2.  Parking areas, islands, and medians. 
3.  Buffers. 
4.  Areas adjacent to buildings. 
(7)  Special cases. 
a.  Insufficient space for trees on site. If the required tree quality points cannot be met on site due to lot size and allowable building setback, trees shall be planted off site or payment made to the tree fund. Off-site planting location or payment must be approved by the Administrator. 
b.  Insufficient space for landscaping on site. If the required landscape quality points cannot be met on site due to lot size and allowable building setback, payment shall be made to the tree fund. 
c.  Car/boat/trailer sales lots. The requirement of canopy cover in the outdoor display, sales and storage areas may be waived for such uses only if the requirements have been met elsewhere on the site. The required 400 landscape quality points per acre, however, shall be provided in this area to break up large expanses of pavement. 
1.  Employee and customer parking areas shall be clearly delineated to separate them from outdoor display, sales and storage areas. Such parking areas shall provide 1,200 tree quality points per acre in canopy trees and 400 landscape quality points per acre in landscaping. 
2.  Porous paving may be used within outdoor display, sales and parking areas to provide root growth area for new and existing trees. 
d.  Cellular phone towers. Due to the size and location of many cellular tower sites, it is often impracticable to plant the required landscaping on the site; therefore, the Administrator may approve any of the following three alternatives: 
1.  Planting large canopy trees within the front yard setback along the roadways if there are no conflicting utility locations. The required tree and landscape quality points may be combined together to provide tree quality points for the site; 
2.  When utilities or site constraints do not allow planting within the front yard setback, plantings may be approved off-site at other locations within the immediate neighborhood. Trees may be planted either in the street right-of-way where there are no utilities or in street tree easements on private property; or 
3.  When there are no viable locations either on site or within the immediate vicinity, a contribution may be made to the tree fund. 
e.  Stormwater detention areas. Where planting within a stormwater detention area will help it function more efficiently and make the detention area more visually attractive, such plantings are permitted subject to the following conditions: 
1.  The centerline of the swale of a storm drainage easement shall remain free of debris and plantings with the exception of grasses or ground cover material which stabilizes the bare soil. This area shall be maintained so that the flow of water is not impeded. Plantings of shrubbery and trees shall be maintained at a distance of a minimum of ten feet or as approved by the Administrator from the centerline of the swale so as to keep the area clear for water flow; 
2.  The area immediately surrounding drainage structures including but not limited to grates, inlets, and weirs shall be kept free from plantings and mulch to keep debris from clogging the structures and impeding the flow of water. All trees and shrubs shall be maintained at a distance of a minimum of ten feet from such structures; 
3.  All trees in the immediately surrounding area of a storm water detention area shall be kept a minimum distance of ten feet from the centerline of the basin, or one-third the width of the basin floor, whichever is greater; 
4.  Shrubbery shall be excluded from the basin floor and banks. Shrubs may be planted at the top of the basin where there is no likelihood of the rootballs lifting out of the ground when the basin is filled with water; 
5.  Species of vegetation to be planted in or near detention basins and drainage ways are to be reviewed and approved by the Administrator. 
(b)  Single-family residential subdivisions. 
(1)  Trees required. Canopy street trees shall be planted within the rights-of-way or in tree easements if sufficient right-of-way space is not available. Trees shall be planted an average of 50 feet apart, along all street frontages within the subdivision. Each street tree shall have a value of 90 tree quality points. For new arterial and collector streets that are within the overall development but do not have any lots abut onto them, a plan must be submitted providing for the planting of canopy trees on both sides of the street spaced an average of 75 feet apart. In addition, trees retained or planted to amount to 1,600 tree quality points/developable acreage in all common areas and all other areas not occupied by lots (not including street rights-of-way). 
(2)  Plans required. 
a.  In order to obtain a land clearing permit for lots, rights-of-way, and easements, a greenspace plan, including a tree survey for tall common areas (e.g. park areas, detention areas, etc.) shall accompany each preliminary plan for review. Such plan shall conform to the standards and requirements of these regulations. 
b.  For individual lots. Reserved. 
(3)  Requirements for utilities crossing in the tree easement. Utilities crossing the tree easement shall be located outside of the critical root zone of trees unless otherwise approved by the Administrator. Utility locations shall allow for the unobstructed planting of street trees at an average of 50 feet apart (ranging between 40 to 60 feet apart). 
(4)  Tree requirements within new single-family subdivisions. Planted street trees and 1,600 TQPs in retained and/or planted trees in common areas: 
a.  Canopy street trees shall be planted within the right-of-way or in tree easements if sufficient right-of-way space is not available. Such trees shall be no less than two and one-half inches in caliper at time of installation. Trees shall be planted an average of 50 feet apart, along all street frontages within the subdivision. Each planted street tree shall have a value of 90 tree quality points. For new arterial and collector streets that are within the overall development but do not have residential lots abut onto them, a plan must be submitted providing for the planting of canopy trees on both sides of the street spaced at an average of 75 feet. 
b.  The tree species for each street must be approved by the Administrator. 
c.  1,600 tree quality points per developable acreage shall also be retained and/or planted in all areas outside of the street right-of-way that are not developed as lots (e.g. storm water detention/retention areas, recreational areas, parks, other set-aside areas, etc.). 
d.  Upon approval, the developer may pay to the tree fund an amount equal to the cost of purchase and installation of required trees and the trees will be planted by the Governing Authority after completion of the subdivision or enter into a contract to plant the trees secured by an appropriate bond. The amount of the tree fund is based on the number and species of trees needed to meet the required tree quality points, the commercial price and installation cost for such trees or enter into a contract to plant the trees secured by an appropriate bond. 
e.  Existing trees. Existing trees for which tree quality point are sought shall be protected (and may be counted towards tree quality points), within set-aside areas, in common areas, in buffers, or elsewhere as approved by the Administrator provided that they be protected prior to clearing. 
f.  Trees within set aside areas. Existing and/or planted trees within set-aside as defined by this chapter may count towards the 1,600 tree quality points/developable acreage requirement if they meet all other requirements of this section.

(f)  Design standards. 
(1)  Fences and walls in buffers. The design of a fence or wall shall be a similar architectural style and materials as the principal building or buildings on the lot. Except where otherwise allowed by these regulations, any fence or wall shall be opaque so as to prevent the passage of light and debris, and shall be constructed of textured or split-faced block, brick, stone, stucco over concrete block, architectural tile, decay-resistant wood, or similar opaque materials. Decay-resistant wood includes wood that is naturally decay resistant (e.g., cedar, cypress, redwood) or wood that has been chemically and/or mechanically treated (e.g., chromate copper arsenate (CCAJ) to a retention rate such that the manufacturer provides a guarantee against decay for 40 years. 
Unfinished concrete block shall not be permitted. Chainlink or wire fences shall be permitted within nonresidential zoning districts to buffer similar uses provided that plant material is planted immediately behind or in front of the fence. 
The height of a fence or wall shall not exceed eight feet. Fences and walls shall be interrupted at intervals not exceeding 25 feet by architectural features such as pilasters or columns or by various species of plants that are at least as tall as the fence or wall or taller. 
The fence or wall shall be set back not less than five feet from the property line unless otherwise approved by the LCPC. The height of a fence or wall shall be measured from the finished grade at the base of the fence or wall to the top of the fence or wall, but shall not include columns or posts. 
(2)  Hedges. For newly established hedges, plants shall be a minimum of three feet in height. The area between the property line and the hedge shall be grassed and well maintained. 
(3)  Vegetative buffers. In general, the purpose of a vegetative buffer is to achieve a degree of opacity that prevents clear recognition of the use being buffered. There shall be no encroachment of structures or paving within the area designated as a buffer. 
a.  Trees. Trees shall be planted in conformance with requirements of this chapter. Standards for the size, planting, protection, and care of trees planted within a required buffer shall conform to the requirements of this chapter regardless of whether tree quality points are requested for the trees. 
b.  Shrubs. Shrubs shall be planted in conformance with the requirements of the land disturbing and tree protection ordinance. Standards for the size, planting, protection, and care of shrubs planted within a required buffer shall conform to the requirements of this chapter or the landscape and tree ordinance manual regardless of whether landscape quality points are requested for the shrubs. 
c.  Preserved stands of vegetation within buffers. Preserved stands of mature trees within buffers shall also conform to the requirements of this chapter. The acceptability of mature stands of trees as a buffer shall be determined by the Administrator in conformance with the provisions of said ordinance regardless of whether tree or landscape quality points are requested for the stands. Provided however; that selective hand clearing of underbrushing may be permitted if approved. 
(4)  Other fences. In general, a wall or fence shall not exceed six feet unless specifically permitted or unless specifically requested by this chapter. Under no circumstances shall a fence in the front yard be located parallel to the right-of-way that is higher than four feet.

The total required tree quality points and landscape quality points shall match the approved plan. Any changes must be shown on an as-built plan. 
(2)  Temporary tree and landscape bond. 
a.  The owner shall post a temporary tree and landscape bond for tree and/or landscape installation which cannot be planted because of continued construction, weather, plant availability, or other approved delay. The bond shall be posted. At the same time, a deadline for the completion of work shall be scheduled with the Administrator. 
b.  The Administrator shall make a final inspection of the trees and landscaping at the scheduled completion of work. If work has been completed, the temporary tree and landscape bond shall be refunded. If the landscaping is not complete at the scheduled deadline, the temporary tree and landscape bond shall be withheld based on the amount of work incomplete. 
(3)  Two-year tree and landscape establishment bond. 
a.  A two-year tree and landscape establishment bond equal to the value of 50 percent of the tree quality points shall be posted with LCPC after the Administrator gives an approval of the trees and landscaping at the final inspection and prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
b.  Two years after the date of the bond, the Administrator will inspect the site and make a determination of whether the required trees and landscaping are viable, in which case the bond will be released. If deficiencies are found, the owner of the property shall be notified to correct the deficiencies within 90 days. If the deficiencies are not corrected in 90 days, the City shall use the bond to the extent necessary to bring the property into compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(4)  Continuing obligation for maintenance. All trees and landscaping credited toward tree quality points or landscaping quality points shall be maintained according to industry standards. 
a.  Any damage or injury occurring to a preserved tree by determination of the Administrator sufficient to cause the tree to die within five years or develop into an irreparable hazard tree shall be removed and shall lose tree quality points. Any tree so removed from the site shall be replaced with a tree of equal or greater tree quality points. 
b.  Damage not considered to be fatal to a preserved tree by the Administrator but considered hazardous to the public shall immediately be repaired and shall result in a proportional decrease in tree quality points where applicable. Assessment of damage and repair shall be made by the Administrator. The property owner shall be solely responsible for watering and fertilizing trees and landscaping to maintain plants health and vigor. Failure to maintain the required points on the property shall be a violation of this chapter. 
(5)  Perpetual compliance. All sites are required to remain in compliance with the total TQP and LQP required for development and are subject to inspection by the City for this purpose. If deficiencies are found, the owner of the property shall be notified to correct the deficiencies within 90 days. If the deficiencies are not corrected in 90 days, the City will seek administrative or judicial relief as appropriate.

(b)  No building permit for any development activity generating water and/or wastewater treatment demand and thereby required to pay a facility expansion fee pursuant to this article shall be issued by the City unless and until the required facility expansion fee has been paid. 
(Code 1978, § 20-75; Ord. No. 1995-12, 10-19-1995) 
Sec. 19-99. - Computation of facility expansion fee. 
(a)  Amount to be determined by fee schedule. 
(1)  At the option of the developer, the amount of the facility expansion fee may be determined from the fee schedule fixed and established by the Mayor and City Council from time to time and maintained on file in the office of the City Clerk, or as per the provisions of subsection (a)(2) of this section. 
(2)  If a building permit is requested for a building with mixed uses, the fee shall be determined according to the fee schedule fixed and established by the Mayor and City Council from time to time and maintained on file in the office of the City Clerk by apportioning the space committed to uses specified on the fee schedule. If the type of development activity for which a building permit is applied for is not specified on the fee schedule, the Director shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. The Director shall be guided in the selection of a comparable type by the reports and studies done by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and/or the State, and/or the City Department of Public Works, and/or professional organizations such as the American Water Works Association, the Water Environmental Federation, or the American Society of Civil Engineers. If the Director determines the fee by using water and/or wastewater demands generation statistics from the above-named sources and applying the formula set forth in subsection (b) of this section. In the case of change of use, redevelopment or modification of an existing use that requires the issuance of a building permit, the facility expansion fee shall be based upon the net increase in the fee for the new use as compared to the previous use. The Director shall be guided in this determination by the above-named sources. 
(b)  Individual fee determination. If a developer shall elect not to have the facility expansion fee determined according to subsection (a) of this section, then the developer may apply for an individual fee determination. A developer applying for an individual fee determination shall prepare and submit to the Director an individual fee calculation study for the development activity for which a building permit is sought. The individual fee calculation study shall follow the prescribed methodologies and formats for the study established by the Director, or, subject to the prior approval of the Director, such other professionally accepted methodology that identifies a project's proportionate share. The developer shall attend a preapplication meeting with the Director and no agreement or understanding in regard to data, assumptions or methodology shall be binding upon the City unless provided to the developer in writing. The water and/or wastewater treatment demand engineering documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the individual fee calculation was made, including but not limited to the following: 
(1)  Water and/or wastewater treatment demand engineering studies including documentation of water and/or wastewater treatment demand rates appropriate for the development activity; 
(2)  Cost documentation studies including documentation of the cost per unit of impact for water and/or wastewater treatment construction and documentation credits attributable to the development activity which can be expected to be available to replace the portion of the service volume used by the water and/or wastewater treatment demand generated by the development activity. This documentation shall be prepared and presented by qualified professionals in their respective fields and shall follow best professional practices and methodologies. The following formula, as explained in the methodology report, shall be used by the Director to determine the capital facilities fee per unit of development based on the type of land use: 
[Unit Cost × Demand] - Credit = Proportionate Share 
Whereby: 
Unit Cost = The average cost per gallon of capacity to provide water and/or wastewater treatment system or facilities within the service district. 
Demand = The average volume/capacity of water and/or wastewater treatment expected to be consumed by a given land use on a daily basis. 
Credit = The average present value of future payments by a land use towards the retirement of debt incurred to construct water and/or wastewater facilities. 
The Director shall provide the developer with a written individual fee determination within 30 days after presentation of the individual fee calculation study. 
(c)  Certification. 
(1)  Upon application to the Director, any person engaging in a development activity requiring payment of a water and/or wastewater facility expansion fee may apply for and shall receive from the Director a certification of the application of the water and/or wastewater facility expansion fee schedule to a particular development activity proposal or a certification of an individual fee determination for a particular development proposal. 
(2)  Applications for certification shall include the following information items: 
a.  A full and complete description of the project; 
b.  A full and complete description of the proposed land use and the particular proposed development activity; 
c.  A statement as to whether the applicant seeks a certification of the water and/or wastewater facility expansion fee schedule as applied to that particular development proposal of a certification of an individual fee determination; and 
d.  If the applicant seeks a certification of an individual fee determination, an individual fee calculation study complying with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section. 
(3)  The Director shall provide an applicant with a written certification of the application of the water and/or wastewater facility expansion fee schedule to a particular proposed development activity within five days after the Director's receipt of a completed application. The written certification of the Director shall establish the water and/or wastewater facility expansion fee for a particular proposed development activity for a period of 180 days from the date of certification. The Director shall provide the applicant with a written certification of an individual fee determination within 30 days after receipt of a completed application. The individual fee determination certified by the Director shall establish the water and/or wastewater facility expansion fee for the 180-day period immediately following the date of such certification. Notwithstanding the issuance of any such certification, any changes in or additions to the proposed development activity different from the particular proposed development activity identified in the original application shall be subject to increased or additional water and/or wastewater facility expansion fees to the extent that such changes or additions require capital improvements or facilities expansions. The additional water and/or wastewater facility expansion fees shall be based upon the most current water and/or wastewater facility expansion fee schedule in effect on the date of the issuance of a building permit. 
(d)  Requirements. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, prior to engaging in development activity generating water and/or wastewater treatment demand, and in addition to any other applicable requirements, the developer shall certify in writing to the Director: 
(1)  A full and complete description of the project; 
(2)  A full and complete description of the proposed land use; 
(3)  A statement of the gross square footage applicable to each category of land use; and 
(4)  Prior to the completion of the project, and as a condition of final inspection, the developer shall recertify in writing to the Director the actual land use of the project, and shall present an architect's certificate of the actual gross square footage attributable to each use. In the event that the actual use and/or the actual gross square footage applicable to the actual use differs from that originally certified, and in the event that the facility expansion fee was previously paid, the developer shall be required to pay the amount of the excess as a condition of final inspection. The amount of the excess shall be based upon the most current water and/or wastewater facility expansion fee schedule in effect on the date of final inspection.

Sec. 518. - MR, military reservation district. 
    This district is created to the needs of those portions of Fort Stewart located within the boundaries of the City of Hinesville. Any property owned or controlled by the United States may be used for the purpose of a military reservation, including all accessory uses and structures (including non-military activities). The provisions of this article, either substantive or procedural, shall not apply to any such use to the extent that the use is regulated by the United States. 
Sec. 519. - Downtown redevelopment overlay district. 
(a)  Generally. There shall be established within the City of Hinesville, Georgia, a zoning district which is placed over the base zoning system to modify the development guidelines and to achieve a specific purpose for that area of the City which falls within the boundaries of the district. The area within the boundaries of the district shall be known as the "downtown redevelopment overlay district." There shall be established within the downtown redevelopment overlay district four subareas, which shall be known as the "historic urban core," "mixed use corridors," "multifamily residential redevelopment," and "single-family residential redevelopment." The boundaries of the downtown redevelopment overlay district and its four subareas shall be specifically delineated on the official Zoning Map of the City of Hinesville, Georgia. All land, buildings and structures within the downtown redevelopment overlay district shall be regulated by three separate and distinct regulations, including: 
(1)  The regulations of the underlying, or base, zoning system, meaning the use regulations, special permit uses, height regulations, area regulations, and other zoning-related requirements that apply to a parcel by virtue of the zoning classification assigned to that parcel by the City; 
(2)  The additional regulations set forth in this section which shall apply to a parcel, building or structure by virtue of its lying within the boundaries of the downtown redevelopment overlay district; [and] 
(3)  The additional regulations, development standards, and permitted land uses set forth in this section which shall apply to a parcel, building or structure by virtue of its lying within the boundaries of one or more subareas of the downtown redevelopment overlay district, including the historic urban core, mixed use corridors, multifamily residential redevelopment, or single-family residential redevelopment. 
(b)  Effect upon existing land uses. 
(1)  All existing parcels shall be considered to be in compliance with this section until the parcel is redeveloped, modified, or rehabilitated to the extent that improvements are equal to or greater than 50 percent of the existing fair market value of the property prior to improvements. Once improvements reach this threshold, all additions to the parcel must adhere to the new regulations set forth in this section. 
(2)  Properties located within the downtown redevelopment overlay district will retain all of the rights conferred by their existing zoning classifications. New property rights will be conferred on properties located within the downtown redevelopment overlay district that meet the criteria established in this section. 
(3)  Nothing in this section shall preclude a property owner from petitioning the City for an amendment, modification or variance to any zoning classification as otherwise allowed by the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Hinesville, Georgia. 
(c)  Effect upon existing applications for development. All applications for development within the Downtown Hinesville Redevelopment District prior to August 7, 2003, shall be exempt from the regulations herein. Any application submitted to the City of Hinesville for development or redevelopment after March 4, 2004 will be subject to the requirements of this section. 
(d)  Legislative purpose. The specific urban design, transportation, and land use policies set forth by this section are an extension of the orderly growth policies developed for the City of Hinesville in the Liberty County Joint Comprehensive Plan. This section seeks to generate quality development, preservation of historic structures, conservation of green space, greater mixing of uses, more pedestrian-friendly design, more housing options, and additional connectivity for travelers within and through the City. 
(e)  Legislative intent; factors to be considered. In resolving conflicts between this section and other zoning-related regulations, in providing for economic incentives to persons who develop land, buildings and structures within the downtown redevelopment overlay district, and at other times within the sound discretion of the governing authority of the City of Hinesville when it is called upon to interpret any provisions of this section, the intent of this legislation may be considered. By regulating the downtown redevelopment overlay district, the City of Hinesville seeks to: 
(1)  Allow a mixture of complementary land uses that may include housing, retail, offices, commercial, and civic uses, in order to maintain and create new economic and social vitality and to encourage the linking of trips and reduce the dependence upon the automobile for the majority of trips; 
(2)  Develop commercial and mixed-use areas that are safe, comfortable, and attractive to pedestrians; 
(3)  Provide roadway, pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit connections to residential areas; 
(4)  Provide transitions and buffers between high traffic streets and residential neighborhoods; 
(5)  Encourage a mix of housing types and locations to provide for additional opportunities for people in all stages of life and incomes to enjoy safe, decent, and attractive places to live; 
(6)  Attain greater mobility throughout the City for bicyclists and pedestrians; 
(7)  Provide appropriate locations and design for the addition of transit services; 
(8)  Maintain mobility along transportation corridors; 
(9)  Preserve and enhance the character of the historic commercial and residential areas; 
(10)  Provide for protection of natural resources; 
(11)  The intent of the City of Hinesville's Overlay District focuses on several main themes: 
(A)  Public space: To preserve, enhance, or create many forms of publicly accessible open space, such as parks, plazas, water features, tree-lined streets and community gathering areas. 
(B)  Compact mixed-use: To create a compact concentration of land uses within each development through multiple uses in a single building or in the same general area. 
(C)  Street activity: To encourage a sense of place by allowing the imaginative and efficient utilization of land and to develop a sense of community by promoting year-round pedestrian and outdoor activities at the street level. 
(D)  Pedestrian-orientation: To reduce the dependence upon and dominance of the automobile through street design, shared parking, bicycle and pedestrian pathways and spaces, and pedestrian-scaled buildings. 
(E)  Design: To achieve a unique aesthetic design through high quality architecture and construction with attention to placement, relationship, and orientation of structures to provide a greater compatibility with surrounding land uses. 
(F)  Community cohesiveness: To provide physical linkages and opportunities for recreational and social connections throughout the community to allow residents and visitors to enhance their quality of life in Hinesville. 
(f)  Resolving conflicts. Where a conflict arises between the requirements of this section and the underlying zoning classification requirements, the district regulations set forth in this section shall ordinarily prevail. Where a conflict arises between the district and the floodplain/wetlands district, the floodplain/wetland district shall prevail. 
(g)  Boundaries generally. The general boundaries of the downtown redevelopment overlay district may be those properties extending the distance from the Fort Stewart boundary at West General Stewart Way to the intersection of East General Stewart Way and East Oglethorpe Highway, westerly on West Oglethorpe Highway to the intersection of East General Screven Way, northeast along General Screven Way to the boundary of Fort Stewart. The actual zoning boundary, as well as subarea boundaries, shall be as approved by the Mayor and City Council after review and recommendation by the Liberty Consolidated Planning Commission. If a portion of a parcel lies within the overall boundaries, the entire parcel shall be considered to be within the boundaries of the overlay district. 
(h)  Design guidelines. Development and design requirements that apply within the downtown redevelopment overlay district are established in-part within this section and in-part by a separate manual known as the Overlay District & Historic Downtown Hinesville Design Guideline Manual (W.K. Dickson & Co., Inc., March 2004 edition). The design guideline manual is incorporated in its entirety by reference in this section and shall have the same force and effect as if set forth verbatim within this section. The design guideline manual, March 2004 edition, shall not be amended in the future except by action of the governing authority of the City of Hinesville. 
(i)  Development regulations for the overlay district; general. 
(1)  Streetscape. Refer to Overlay District & Historic Downtown Hinesville Design Guideline Manual (W.K. Dickson & Co., Inc., March 2004 edition). 
(2)  Underground utilities. Refer to Overlay District & Historic Downtown Hinesville Design Guideline Manual (W.K. Dickson & Co., Inc., March 2004 edition). Where practical, all utilities' services and connections shall be located underground. 
(3)  Architecture and building materials. Refer to Overlay District & Historic Downtown Hinesville Design Guideline Manual (W.K. Dickson & Co., Inc., March 2004 edition). Specific dimensional requirements for signage shall be as specified by article VIII of the City of Hinesville Zoning Ordinance. 
(j)  Transportation. 
(1)  General requirements. 
(A)  Street designs should permit safe and comfortable use of streets by motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Pavement widths, design speeds and the number of motor travel lanes should be minimized to enhance safety for motorists and non-motorists alike, except in designated commercial corridors where higher volumes of traffic are desired and appropriate. The specific design of any given street must consider the building types which have frontage and the relationship of the street to the overall City street network. 
(B)  Streets must interconnect within a development and with adjoining developments. Cul-de-sacs shall be allowed only where topographical and/or lot line configurations offer no practical alternatives for connections or through traffic. Street stubs shall be provided within each development adjacent to open land to provide for future connections. 
(C)  Streets must be designed as the most prevalent public space of the town and be scaled to the pedestrian. 
(D)  Streets must be bordered by sidewalks on both sides, with the exception of alleys or service corridors. Sidewalks on one side of the road may be permitted by the Director of Liberty Consolidated Planning Commission as an incentive to protect water quality or to achieve other community goals. 
(E)  Streets must be lined with street trees on both sides, with the exception of State highways and alleys. 
(F)  Streets must be public. Private streets are not permitted within any new development. Alleys will be classified as public or private depending on function. 
(G)  Streets must be the focus of buildings. Generally, all buildings will front on public streets. 
(2)  Traffic calming. Traffic calming measures, such as neckdowns, chicanes, mid-block diverters, intersection diverters, curb bulbs, and related devices will be considered on a case by case basis, based on safety and appropriateness in the proposed locations, taking into consideration the overall function of the roadway. 
(3)  Street and path connections. To improve circulation within the City's downtown redevelopment overlay district for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists, the following street connections should be implemented: 
(A)  Realignment of Memorial Drive/East Washington Avenue; 
(B)  Ryon Avenue/E. G. Miles Parkway/Hendry Street Intersection Modification; [and] 
(C)  New Multi-Purpose Trail Connection from Downtown Hinesville to the Regional Park located on Oglethorpe Highway/SR 84. 
(4)  Access driveways. It is the intent of the City to minimize the number of separate driveways to private properties, thereby reducing the potential for vehicular crashes and pedestrian injuries. If adjacent lots have direct vehicular access to a street, the City may require that the access be through a common or joint driveway using inter-parcel connections between properties. Access from private properties onto State highways shall be coordinated through the City of Hinesville prior to requesting the access connection from the Georgia Department of Transportation. 
(5)  Sidewalks. Refer to Overlay District & Historic Downtown Hinesville Design Guideline Manual (W.K. Dickson & Co., Inc., March 2004 edition). 
(6)  Inter-parcel connections. Linking residential subdivisions and mixed-use developments using inter-parcel connections and pathways or trails are encouraged to facilitate non-auto movements in the area. Inter-parcel connections between properties in commercial areas should be provided to minimize the need for auto traffic movements on the street system. Pedestrian paths should be direct and convenient. Overly circuitous pedestrian paths should be avoided. 
(7)  Parking. Refer to Overlay District & Historic Downtown Hinesville Design Guideline Manual (W.K. Dickson & Co., Inc., March 2004 edition), article VII of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Hinesville, and the Bonuses and Criteria for Bonuses set forth in this section. 
(8)  Road design speeds. Roadway design speeds should not exceed 20 miles per hour on any neighborhood street. The roadway design speeds for collector streets should not exceed 30 miles per hour. Only the speeds on arterials and State highway routes may exceed these design speeds, as specified by the Mayor and City Council. 
(9)  Traffic control. Traffic control features, including signs, pavement markings, etc. shall be prepared in accordance with the guidance of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). The developer is responsible for the initial installation of the devices and the maintenance thereof until the public (City of Hinesville or other public entity) accepts the street for maintenance. 
(10)  Gateways. Refer to design guidelines. No other gateway signs shall be permitted other than those designated by the City of Hinesville. 
(k)  Public transit. The City of Hinesville must plan for future public transportation facilities and services within the downtown redevelopment area. Increasing population and employment growth and land use intensities will place additional pressures on the transportation system that will not be able to be met with road widening projects alone. 
(1)  Sidewalks for transit. Sidewalks at transit stops should be a minimum of ten feet wide. A width of 15 feet is desired in commercial areas. The desired width of sidewalks located between bus stops is eight feet wide. 
(2)  Curbside lane. The curbside lane width on streets serving transit routes (with nonparking) is 12 feet minimum and 14 feet desired. The desired curbside lane width on streets serving transit routes (with on-street parking) is 20 feet (18 feet minimum). The desired non-curbside lane widths of streets serving transit vehicles is 12 feet (11 feet minimum). Lane widths narrower than 11 feet should be avoided since they could result in encroachment of transit vehicles into adjacent lanes. 
(3)  Intersections. Intersections should be properly designed to allow transit vehicles to turn safely onto streets. The following guidelines should be used for the turning radii at intersections. 
(A)  For turns into a two-lane street with parking, a turning radius of 20 feet minimum; 
(B)  For turns into a two-lane street from a street with parking, a turning radius of 20 feet minimum; 
(C)  For turns into a single-lane, a turning radius of 30 feet minimum; 
(D)  For turns into a two-lane street with no parking, a turning radius of 30 feet minimum; 
(E)  For transit facility dimensional requirements, refer to the transit design parameters graphic found in Overlay District & Historic Downtown Hinesville Design Guideline Manual (W.K. Dickson & Co., Inc., March 2004 edition); [and] 
(F)  Parking for bicycles should be encouraged at key transit stops, especially in and near the downtown area and schools. 
(4)  Bicycle facilities. It is the intent of the City to create safe, convenient, and adequate facilities to encourage bicycle riding as a valuable part of a balanced transportation system within the overlay district area. These can be accomplished through the development of a range of bicycle facilities as defined by the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) "Bicycle Facilities Guidebook," including bicycle lanes, bicycle paths, bicycle routes, and bikeways. Adequate bike parking facilities and signs are encouraged in key locations to facilitate safe and secure bicycling in the area. 
(l)  Development standards: Historic urban core. 
(1)  Boundary. The boundaries of the downtown redevelopment overlay district and the historic urban core subarea shall be specifically delineated on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Hinesville, Georgia. 
(2)  Permitted uses. Same as in DD, including R-4, R-TH, R-A-1, O-I, C-1, and O-C, and further to include the following more particularly described uses:

(Ord. No. 2004-01, § I(2), 1-12-2004; Ord. No. 2004-03, § I(1), 5-20-2004; Ord. No. 2004-09, § I(B), 11-18-2004; Ord. No. 2006-11, § I, 2-1-2007) 
Sec. 520. - Planned development districts (PDD). 
    The planned development district is to be used within the downtown redevelopment overlay district defined in section 519. 
(1)  Generally. The purpose of this section is to encourage the unified and harmonious improvement of land and buildings under a unified plan of development rather than under conventional lot-by-lot regulations. The City of Hinesville benefits from variety in building types, compatibility of uses and optimum community development. The developer benefits from better land use, economy in development and flexibility in design. Review of the development plan by the City of Hinesville provides an opportunity to ensure that the development will be in harmony with in which it is located. 
a.  Ownership control. All of the land in a planned development initially shall be in single ownership by an individual, a partnership, tenants in common, a corporation or by some other legal entity. However, this shall not preclude several contiguous property owners from making a joint application for a planned development. Individual properties in a planned development may only be sold after a final plat has been approved and recorded with the properties, subject to private deed covenants that ensure the continuance of the planned development as originally approved and developed, or as otherwise provided in this section. 
b.  Sewer and water requirements. All planned developments shall be served by public sewer or by a sewer system approved by the City of Hinesville. All specifications regarding water supply and sewage treatment design and effective disposal shall be included in the overall development plans for a planned development. 
c.  Exempt from conventional development standards. Planned developments shall be exempt from the conventional development standards of this chapter. The provisions of this section shall govern their approval. 
d.  Common use restrictions through covenant and declaration requirements. When a planned development requires the creation of a homeowners' association to govern the use of common open space or other common areas, the required covenants, declaration and restrictions shall be filed with the Clerk of Superior Court and, as a minimum, shall provide for: mandatory and automatic membership in the homeowners' association as a function of home or dwelling unit ownership; creation of the homeowners' association before any individual properties are sold; all owners to have equal access and right of use to all shared and common facilities; perpetual and continued maintenance of open and shared space; tax liability in the case of default; the method of assessment for dues, maintenance and related costs; and, where appropriate, party wall maintenance and related costs; and restoration in the event of damage or destruction. 
e.  Open space improvements. When open space is required to be provided as part of a planned improvement, the developer shall submit with his application for approval of the planned development a plan for the improvement and maintenance of open space acres and shall follow the plan which is approved in developing the property. 
f.  Open space maintenance. Where this article requires or allows the preservation of open space and other common areas through a homeowners' association, and if the homeowners' association fails to maintain the common property in a reasonable condition, the Building Inspector shall serve written notice upon the association and upon the individual property owner of the planned development, setting forth the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain common open space in a reasonable condition. The notice shall include a demand that these deficiencies of maintenance are corrected within 30 days of the notice. If the deficiencies are not corrected within 30 days, the City, in order to preserve the taxable values of the properties within the planned development and to prevent the common open space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon the common open space and maintain it for one year and thereafter until the association is prepared to provide maintenance. The cost of this maintenance by the City of Hinesville shall be assessed against the properties within the planned developments that have a right of enjoyment of the common open space, and shall become a lien upon the properties. 
(2)  Residential. 
a.  Minimum acres. The minimum acreage of a planned residential development is one acre. 
b.  Usage. No more than 80 percent of a planned residential development shall be developed for single-family residential use. 
c.  Open space requirements. The developer of the planned residential development shall set aside and develop not less than 20 percent of the land area within the development for open space, parks or recreational use. Required streets, drives, yard areas and common parking court areas shall not be credited toward this minimum required open space allocation. Not more than 50 percent of the land reserved for open space purposes shall be within a floodplain. 
d.  Density. The density shall not exceed 16 dwelling units per gross acre within the residential districts. 
e.  Lot size and setbacks. No building containing dwellings shall be erected within 20 feet of any other structure, unless there is an adequate firewall. Further, every dwelling shall have direct access to a street, court, walkway or other area dedicated to public use. 
f.  Minimum buffer. The minimum buffer required for this development shall be in accordance with district development standards established for the zoning district in which the residential use is located, if any. 
g.  Street frontage. Units within the planned development which front on a street may front on a public paved street or on a private paved street having a pavement width of not less than 24 feet, or, if this street is designated as being one way, 20 feet. Units within the development may front on an arterial or collector thoroughfare if parking is provided in the rear of the units or in planned parking areas located to the rear of the front building setback line and separated from these streets by an open space providing a minimum depth of 20 feet. Curb cuts shall be limited to one per 100 feet of street frontage. 
h.  Subdivision. A separate parcel of land is required for each dwelling unit (except in a condominium), whether attached or detached. 
i.  Open space between units and buildings. The front or rear face of a dwelling unit shall be not less than 20 feet from the front or rear face of another dwelling unit. The unattached side face of a single-family attached building shall be not less than 40 feet from the rear face of another such building or unit. 
j.  Alignment. No dwelling unit shall be situated so as to face the rear of another dwelling unit within the development unless terrain differences or vegetation will provide effective visual separation. 
k.  Parking. At least two off-street parking spaces shall be provided for each dwelling unit. This space shall be provided under the dwelling unit, to the immediate front or rear of the dwelling unit or in common off-street parking areas not more than 300 feet from the dwelling unit, as measured along the shortest paved route. All off-street parking spaces shall be designed and located so that vehicles will not be required to back into any public street. 
l.  Preservation of common areas. With the exception of condominiums, which shall be governed as by State law provided, a homeowners' association created by the developer, by recorded covenants, declaration and restrictions running with the land, shall preserve and maintain for the owners and occupants of the units the land set aside for open space, parks or recreational use for the subdivision. The book and page in which these covenants, declaration and restrictions are recorded shall be shown on the final plat of the subdivision. This requirement may be granted upon the developer's filing a development plan and survey to which there is entered a covenant by the developer that the minimum open space requirement shall be applied to individual lots within the subdivision. Dedication of open space to the county may also satisfy the open space requirement. 
m.  Water and sewer availability. Each planned development must have a sewer system approved by the City of Hinesville. 
n.  Height. No residential dwelling unit shall exceed 45 feet in height; other structures are limited to 50 feet in height. 
(3)  Nonresidential components. 
a.  Standards applicable to nonresidential components of a planned development district: 
1.  Minimum floor area for planned nonresidential developments: 20,000 square feet. 
2.  Street access requirements: These projects shall be permitted only on a site which abuts an arterial or collector. The minimum distance between curb cuts shall be 100 feet. 
3.  Screening for residential property: In addition to other buffer requirements, when the back of the development is across the street from property in a residential district, then a solid fence or hedge not less than six feet in height shall be installed and maintained by the developer to screen the back of the project from the residential property. 
4.  Development: All uses and activities shall be housed in a permanent enclosed structure with a single primary continuous facade, with the exception of two uses which may be detached from the facade and independently housed in their own permanent, enclosed structure. 
5.  Distance between buildings: Buildings within the development, if separated, shall not be less than 20 feet apart, unless there is an adequate firewall. 
6.  Minimum buffer: The minimum buffer required for this development shall be in accordance with standards established for the zoning district in which the development is located. 
7.  Open space: 15 percent. 
(4)  Procedures for approval.

ARTICLE VIII. - SIGN REGULATIONS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2010-01, § I, adopted March 4, 2010, amended article VIII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, article VIII pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2006-01, § I(1)(A-T), adopted March 2, 2006, and Ord. No. 2007-03, § I(A), (B), adopted June 7, 2007. 

Sec. 801. - In general. 
(a)  Findings and purpose. 
(1)  The City of Hinesville finds that signs and advertising are proper and necessary uses of private property, are a means of personal free expression, are a necessary component of a commercial environment, and constitute a legitimate business enterprise. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. The manner of the erection, location, and maintenance of signs affects the public health, safety, morals, and welfare of the citizens of Hinesville. The safety of motorists, pedestrians, cyclists, and other users of the public streets is affected by the number, size, location, lighting and movement of signs that divert the attention of drivers. The size and location of signs may, if uncontrolled, constitute an obstacle to effective fire-fighting techniques. Competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises. Uncontrolled and unlimited signs may degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the economic value of tourism, visitation, and permanent economic growth. The City of Hinesville finds further that regulation of signs is consistent with the City's efforts to revitalize its central business district, its downtown development area, and its urban redevelopment area. 
(2)  Regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the City, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the City's citizens. The purpose of the Mayor and City Council in enacting these sign regulations is to create a comprehensive and balanced system of sign control that accommodates both the need for a well maintained, safe and attractive community, and the need for effective business identification, advertising and communication. 
(3)  Regulation of the changeable electronic variable message signs have been shown to create possible threats to public safety. These signs allow operators to change content from remote location in a matter of seconds. Such signs are erected for the purpose of trying to hold the attention of motorists by changing messages and pictures for short durations using a series of bright, colorful images produced mainly via LED (light emitting diode) technologies. Brightly lit signs that change messages every few seconds compel motorists to notice them, and lure the attention of motorists away from what is happening on the road and onto the sign. Such signs pose public safety threats because if they attract a motorists' attention the motorist will look at the sign and not at the road. Changeable electronic variable message signs are also a threat to public safety because of their brightness, making them visible from great distances. Due to their nature of brightness and changing displays, changeable electronic variable message signs are more distracting than signs which do not vary the message. Some such signs could, if unregulated, have the appearance of large, plasma-screen televisions. An electronic LED display contains brightly-lit text and graphics which can bee seen from hundreds of feet away, drawing the attention of everyone within view. Unless otherwise regulated, such displays can be extremely bright since they are designed to be visible in bright sunlight and at night. Furthermore, the human eye is drawn to them far more strongly than to traditional illuminated signs. Such electronic LED displays can be seen from as far away as six-tenths of a mile, making them distracting. It takes a minimum of six seconds to comprehend the message on an electronic sign, which is three times the safe period for driver distraction. For these reasons, it is the intent of the City Council to allow changeable electronic variable signs subject to acceptable criteria. 
(4)  Scope. This article is adopted to serve substantial governmental interests of correcting and avoiding multiple problems that would occur without the regulation of signs. The regulations contained herein are no more extensive than necessary to serve the substantial governmental interests identified in the article. It is not the intent of this article to regulate the content of signs, but only their composition, type, location, distance from right-of-way, height, size, illumination, and, in some cases, the duration they may be displayed, or other non-content based restrictions implied in this article. It is not the intent of this article to foreclose important and distinct mediums of expression for political, religious, or personal messages, on any sign permitted to be erected by this article. These regulations shall not be construed as limiting the message content of any sign. 
(5)  The City's aim in regulating signage in the City is directed primarily toward commercial speech, as businesses are by far the most frequent users of signs in Hinesville. The City recognizes the rights of property owners and occupants outside commercial areas of the City to signage of their choosing and further recognizes that courts require protection of all individuals' rights to erect signs as an inexpensive and effective means of communicating ideas. However, it is not the intention of the City to regulate any and all possible means of expressing ideas. The City's regulatory structure for signs is therefore directed to those devices traditionally identifiable as signs and is not intended to reach holiday decorations, architectural elements of buildings, flags, works of art or other physical manifestations of concepts unrelated to traditional signage. Through its sign ordinance the City is further not attempting to regulate traditional free speech activities such as parading, picketing or handbilling that do not involve the physical installation of signs on property. 
(6)  The City has chosen to exempt from permitting requirements certain minor signs that are primarily safety oriented. Studies have shown, for instance, that posting of alarm company signs on residential property has a substantial detrimental effect on residential burglaries. Directional signs are utilized to move vehicular traffic safely in and out of business driveways in an expeditious manner, eliminating or vastly reducing the number of traffic accidents that might otherwise result from unregulated movements. Posting of address numerals is absolutely essential to rapid public safety response in event of emergency and is a service to persons trying to locate unfamiliar properties. It is the City's considered judgment that such signs directly facilitate the public safety and have little or no impact on expressive speech. 
(b)  Authority. This article is enacted pursuant to Article IX, Section II, Paragraph IV of the Georgia Constitution of 1983, the Charter of the City of Hinesville, Georgia, the general police powers of Hinesville and other authority provided by Federal, State or local laws applicable hereto. 
(c)  Administration.

(1)  Upon the filing of an application for a permit and the payment of all necessary fees, it shall be the duty of the City Department of Inspections to examine all plans and specifications submitted and the premises upon which the sign is proposed to be erected, replaced, restored, altered, or relocated. Such review shall be completed within 30 days of submission of a completed sign application. If it appears from review of the permit application and the site that the proposed sign is in compliance with the requirements of this article and all other ordinances and laws of the City, the Department of Inspections shall issue a permit no later than 30 days from receipt of the completed application. 
(2)  The City shall deny permits to applicants who submit applications for signs that do not comply with the provisions of this article, are incomplete, or contain any false material statements. Violation of any provision of this article will be grounds for revoking a permit granted by the City for the erection of a sign.

Alternatively, the City may personally serve the sign applicant with a copy of the written notice of denial within 30 days after the City's receipt of the application. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, instead of the date of the original submission. 
(2)  Should the Director of Inspections revoke an existing permit, the reasons for revocation shall be stated in writing and delivered to the permittee or sign owner by certified or by first class mail to the address on the permit application, or to the permittee's or sign owner's last known address. Alternatively, the City may personally serve the permittee or sign owner by in-hand delivery of the notice of revocation. Alternatively, if the permittee or sign owner cannot be located within the City and the City's mailings are returned undeliverable, the City may notify the permittee or sign owner by posting and affixing the notice of revocation on the sign itself. 
(3)  No permit shall be denied or revoked, except for due cause as hereinafter defined, and after the applicant, permittee, or sign owner is given ten business days written notice containing a statement of the reasons for the denial of the permit application or the revocation of a permit. "Due cause" is the violation of any provision of this article, or other applicable ordinances, State or Federal law, or the submission of an incomplete application or an application containing false material statements. 
(4)  An individual whose permit application has been denied or whose permit has been revoked may appeal the decision to the Citizens Sign Appeals Board, provided such appellant files a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk within ten business days from the postmark date of the Director of Inspections notice, or, alternatively, within ten business days of the date the notice was hand-delivered to the applicant, permittee, or sign owner or was posted to the sign itself pursuant to subsection (d)(2) above. If a notice of appeal is not timely filed, the Director of Inspections' notice shall constitute the City's final determination. The Citizen Sign Appeals Board shall hear and make recommendation to the Mayor and City Council on all such appeals. 
(5)  The Mayor and City Council shall issue a written decision, through the City Manager, to the appellant no later than 30 days following the issuance and delivery of a written recommendation from the Citizens Sign Appeals Board to the Mayor and City Council. Decisions of the Mayor and City Council to affirm the decision of the Director of Inspections or to overrule the decision of the Director of Inspections and grant or continue the permit for which appeal is taken shall be reduced to writing and served upon the appellant in the same manner as the original notice to deny or notice of revocation, or in any other manner allowed by this section. Such decision shall constitute a final determination by the City. 
(6)  If an appellant is dissatisfied with the City's final determination, the appellant may petition for writ of certiorari to the Superior Court as provided by law. 
(7)  Except as otherwise provided by sections 805 and 819, if an individual appeals the Director of Inspections denial or revocation, no action to erect a sign or to remove an existing sign shall be taken by either party pending an appeal to the Citizens Sign Appeals Board. After final determination to revoke an existing permit, the sign shall be removed as provided in this article. 
(8)  Any person commencing work on a sign before securing the necessary permit from the City shall, in addition to other penalties provided by this article, be subject to double permit fees under the permit fee schedule. 
(e)  Permit expiration. If the work authorized by a permit has not been completed within six months after the date of issuance, the permit shall become null and void. No refunds will be made of permit fees for permits that expire due to failure to erect a permitted sign; provided that, where an applicant can demonstrate that a commercial entity was timely engaged to construct the permitted sign but the fabrication has not yet been completed. One 90-calendar day extension may be granted by the Director of Inspections on the duration of the permit. Where a permit has expired for failure to erect the sign, if an individual later desires to erect a sign at the same location, a new application must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule in effect at the time of resubmission. 
(f)  Display of permit. Every sign or billboard constructed, erected, or maintained for which a permit is required by this article shall be plainly marked with the permit decal issued for said structure firmly affixed thereon in such manner that the information therein contained shall be readily accessible and durable. If, however, affixing the decal to the sign is unreasonable or impracticable, the Director of Inspections, or his/her authorized designee, shall authorize the permittee to place the decal on file at his or her place of business or at the site on which the sign is physically located. 
(g)  Permit fees. Fees for permits shall be fixed from time to time by the Mayor and City Council and a schedule of fees and charges shall be maintained by the City Clerk. A fee for each sign permit shall be paid at the time of filing the application. An application for a permit is incomplete if it is not accompanied by payment of the required fee. 
(h)  Removal of temporary signs; procedures. The notice and appeal provisions set forth in this section shall apply whenever the Department of Inspections intends to remove a temporary sign from private property; no notice and appeal rights attach, however, to temporary signs erected on public property or in a public right-of-way.

a.  Description or graphic depiction of the type of internal illumination technology; and 
b.  A drawing or schematic prepared by an electrical engineer showing the amount of light designed to emanate from the proposed sign at the highway or public road to which the sign is directed and at any highway or public road to which the proposed sign is visible, showing measurements in foot-candles. Said drawing or schematic shall show connecting points of equal light illumination levels, similar to a topographic contour, or a photometric grid with individual spot readings; and 
c.  A statement certified by an engineer, acceptable to the Director of Inspections demonstrating that the weight of the sign upon installation has sufficient footing and other characteristics sufficient to ensure the sign will be safely secured and able to withstand wind resistance as may be customary for similar structures according to the applicable building code; and 
d.  Other information as may be reasonably required by the Director of Inspections to ensure compliance with the purpose and regulations of the section of the zoning ordinance, and the purposes and intentions of this zoning (sign)ordinance generally. 
These permit requirements shall be submitted on application forms prepared by the Sign Administrator.

    Step (a) may, and step (c) shall, be completed prior to making any street improvement, installing any utilities or other land disturbing activities. Step (e) shall be completed prior to the sale of any lots in the proposed subdivision. The site proposed to be subdivided must be zoned in the appropriate residential, commercial, industrial, planned development or other zoning district prior to the completion of step (b). 
(Ord. No. 2010-08, 6-17-2010) 
Sec. 4.2. - Review procedure. 
    The following procedure shall be followed in the submission, review, and action upon all subdivision plats: 
4.2.1.  Sketch plan review procedures: Prior to the filing of a preliminary plat, the subdivider may submit to the secretary of the planning commission a simple sketch plan of the proposed subdivision. The sketch plan may be a simple free-hand drawing. Included with the sketch plan should be a sketch map, which shows the subdivision in relation to the surrounding area. The purpose of the sketch plan is to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning for the preparation of the preliminary plat and enable the subdivider to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. The secretary of the planning commission shall review and approve, disapprove, or approve with modification the sketch plan within 15 days from the meeting at which it is presented. Pertinent comments and recommendations shall be noted in the minutes of the planning commission meeting. 
4.2.2.  Preliminary plat procedures: Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the secretary of the planning commission at least 25 days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the planning commission. The plat of the subdivision shall be submitted in six black-line or blue-line prints and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained herein, as well as one electronic copy in a format acceptable to the planning commission. Any preliminary plat submitted to the planning commission shall contain the name and address of the subdivider (or subdivider's designee) to whom notice of hearing may be sent; and no preliminary plat shall be acted upon by the planning commission without affording a hearing thereon, notice of time and place of which shall be sent to said address not less than five days before the date of the hearing. 
(1)  The planning commission may request additional copies of the plat and supplemental information. The above mentioned copies shall be distributed as required by section 5.2.4 of this appendix and additionally as deemed necessary by the secretary of the planning commission. The person or agency, to which a copy of the preliminary plat is directed, shall review the preliminary plat and indicate any required changes or comments on the plat and submit to the planning commission prior to the formal presentation of the preliminary plat. The local governing authority shall receive a copy for review and information. 
(2)  The secretary of the planning commission shall examine the preliminary plat to determine if it meets all requirements of these regulations, has approval of the health department, and/or the state environmental protection division, has been reviewed and approved by the Coastal Soil and Water Conservation District, and that the design of the roadways, drainage structures, public water and sewerage systems and other facilities related to the subdivision have been reviewed and approved by the designated engineer of the planning commission or other designated official. 
(3)  If water and or sewerage systems, not connected to a municipal system, are to be installed, the subdivider is to indicate who will own the system(s), who will operate the system(s) and what assurance will be given to the governing authority for continued operation. 
(4)  The planning commission shall act on the preliminary plat within 45 days after formal submission and having received confirmation of all necessary approvals as described in 4.2.2.(2) above. Failure of the planning commission to act within 45 days after formal submission of the complete preliminary plat shall be deemed to constitute approval and certificate to that effect shall be issued by the planning commission on demand: provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period. The action of the commission shall be recorded in the minutes of the commission meeting. 
(5)  The planning commission shall vote to recommend approval or disapproval of the preliminary plat to the governing authority. In the event a preliminary plat is disapproved the grounds for such disapproval shall be noted in the minutes of the planning commission and a copy of such minutes provided to the subdivider. Failure of a subdivider to initiate any development within 18 months from the approval of the preliminary plat by the governing authority will require the preliminary plat to be resubmitted to the planning commission for approval. The developer shall not initiate action to change any of the existing conditions reported on the preliminary plat as required by paragraph 5.2.2 until the preliminary plat has been approved. 
(6)  Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat by the governing authority shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets, location of other required infrastructure, and the dimensions and shapes of lots. Application for approval of the final plat will be considered only after the requirements for final plat approval as specified herein have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the planning commission, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of these regulations and the preparation of the final subdivision plat. 
4.2.3.  Reserved. 
4.2.4.  Final plat procedure: After completion of the physical development of public water, non-portable reuse water lines, sewer, drainage, and roadway base and curb and gutter as shown on the approved preliminary plat, the subdivider may submit to the secretary of the planning commission three copies of the final plat, and one electronic copy in a format acceptable to the planning commission, prepared in accordance with the provisions of these regulations along with the required certificates executed by the appropriate officials. Application for approval of a final plat shall be submitted to the secretary of the planning commission, along with a bond or letter of credit for an amount necessary to complete any remaining primary and secondary improvements, at least ten days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the planning commission. Remaining primary improvements must be completed within six months from the date of final plat approval by the governing authority. Remaining secondary improvements must be completed within two years from the date of final plat approval by the governing authority. 
Until a final plat of a subdivision has been submitted to, reviewed and approved and signed by the planning commission and the governing authority, the clerk of the Superior Court of Liberty County shall not record the plat of such subdivision, nor shall the owner or agent of such subdivision transfer title to any lot within the subdivision by reference to the subdivision plat. For large subdivisions the final plat may be submitted for approval in contiguous sections satisfactory to the governing authority. 
(1)  The installation of streets, sidewalks, street trees, drainage systems, water, nonportable reuse water lines, and sewerage systems shall be in compliance with the governing authority's standard specifications for materials and installation procedures on file with the planning commission and the governing authority's flood regulations. The elevation of fill and the installation of streets, sidewalks, street trees, drainage systems, water, non-portable reuse water lines, and or sewerage systems shall be certified by the developers registered engineer as being in compliance with applicable requirements before approval of the final plat.

Sec. 6.1. - Required improvements. 
    A well-designed subdivision or development includes improvements that provide for the safety and security of all citizens, includes adequate open spaces for recreation and circulation, preserves and protects our wetlands, streams and marshes, and promotes the overall public good. A subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until such buyer can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed and provide adequate levels of service. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get useable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by these regulations necessary to serve the subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat. Any request for an exception to these required improvements must be documented by the developer, and address the reason for the exception and why it meets the spirit and intent of these regulations.

Sec. 8.2. - Quality developments. 
8.2.1.  Intent: It is not the intent of these regulations to freeze new developments into any single type design. It is, however, the intent of these regulations to insure that all new developments shall contribute to the building of economically sound, sustainable and desirable areas within the community with all necessary services and facilities. The purpose of the designation of quality developments is to allow the utilization of land while insuring that there are little or no detrimental impacts on the environment, neighboring properties, and the public safety, welfare and interest. The intent is that all quality developments far exceed the minimum standards defined and encourage innovation in development that enhances and improves public safety and welfare. 
8.2.2.  Authority to modify standards: In order to provide the developer with maximum flexibility in the design and character of new subdivisions and other planned developments, the planning commission is hereby authorized to modify the standards and requirements, but not the intent of these regulations and zoning standards, in the case of a plan that exhibits unique quality growth features within a planned unit, which, in the judgment of the planning commission: 
1)  Provides significant public spaces for circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated; 
2)  Which exhibits unique "quality" features in keeping with state Department of Community Affairs principles; 
3)  Which address each of the City of Hinesville's quality development guidelines; and 
4)  Which provides such covenants or other legal provisions as will assure conformity to and achievement of the comprehensive development plan. 
    Any development considered for "quality development" status shall be analyzed using these principles and the guidelines listed below. The following is a list of the City of Hinesville's performance guidelines against which all proposed quality developments will be analyzed. 
1)  Does the proposed development provide an appropriate and significant amount of uplands dedicated to open space, recreational, and other public uses that are available for the use and enjoyment of the residents and users of the development and citizens of the City of Hinesville? 
2)  Will the development as designed minimize impacts to, and preserve, wetlands and floodplains? 
3)  Has the proposal minimized the impervious surfaces in order to minimize stormwater runoff, and does it include the use of measures such as low impact design or other strategies to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of all runoff? 
4)  Are the connectivity of open spaces and wetlands maximized in such a way as to create and preserve habit areas for wildlife? 
5)  Does the design maximize the preservation and protection of large hardwood trees and woodlands in wetlands and uplands? 
6)  Does the proposal minimize or include mitigation for impacts on the City of Hinesville's, and the neighboring governments, infrastructure systems? 
    The planning commission shall review the proposed development in accordance with these guidelines and the principles, and may recommend modification of standards and requirements should the proposed development exceed the subdivision regulations and adequately address each of these principles and guidelines. The developer or subdivider shall request the planning commission consider the development for designation as a "quality development" and provide the information required by the planning commission in order to evaluate the request for the designation and the modification of any standards or requirements. 
8.2.3.  Maintenance of spirit of regulations: Any development or subdivision approved under this section shall maintain the objectives, purposes, and intent of these regulations. To this end, the planning commission may recommend modification to the standards and requirements of these regulations and the standards defined in the City of Hinesville zoning ordinance.
