    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Madison, Alabama. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1992 Code, as updated by ordinances subsequently adopted by the Mayor and City Council through Ordinance No. 2012-352, adopted September 24, 2012. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1992 Code, as updated, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stands as a guidepost to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jim Jenkins, Senior Code Attorney, and Stephanie Benesh, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Kelly Butler, City Attorney, Ms. Susan Buchanan, Administrative Assistant to the City Attorney, and Ms. Kristen Bruseth, Municipal Records Coordinator, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City of Madison readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

    The provisions appearing in this Code, so far as they are the same in substance as those of ordinances of the city existing at the time of the adoption of this Code, shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments. 
(Code 1979, § 1-3; Code 1992, § 1-3) 
Sec. 1-4. - Catchlines of sections. 
(a)  The catchlines of the sections of this Code are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the sections and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part of any section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any section, including its catchline, is amended or reenacted. 
(b)  The history notes appearing in parentheses after each section and the references and editor's notes scattered throughout the Code are for the benefit of the user of the Code and shall have no legal effect. 
(Code 1979, § 1-4; Code 1992, § 1-4) 
Sec. 1-5. - Interpretation of Code. 
    In all interpretations of this Code, and ordinances, the courts shall look diligently for the intention of the city council, keeping in view, at all times, the old law, the evil, and the remedy.

Sec. 1-6. - Severability of parts of Code. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the city council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by the valid judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code. 
(Code 1979, § 1-5; Code 1992, § 1-5) 
Sec. 1-7. - Effect of repeal of ordinance. 
(a)  No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a former ordinance, whether or not such former ordinance is expressly repealed, as to any offense committed under such former ordinance or as to any act done, any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance takes effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform to the ordinance in force at the time of such proceeding, so far as practicable. If any penalty, forfeiture or punishment is mitigated by any provision of a new ordinance, such provision may be, by the consent of the party affected, applied to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes effect. 
(b)  The repeal of an ordinance shall not revive any ordinances in force before or at the time the ordinance repealed took effect. 
(c)  This section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words or implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provision upon the same subject or in any other ordinance. 
(d)  Nothing contained in this Code shall be construed as abating any action now pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the city herein repealed; or as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, or as waiving any right of the city under any ordinance or provision thereof in force at the time of adoption of this Code. 
(Code 1992, § 1-6) 
Sec. 1-8. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contractor or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete; and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them in a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing sections or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

Motions will be reduced to writing when requested by any member of the council. When a motion is stated or read, the president of the council will submit the motion to the vote of the council. 
(12)  When an amendment is offered and seconded, the vote on the amendment will be taken. If the vote on the amendment is successful, then a vote will be taken on the motion, as amended. If the amendment fails, then the original motion will be put to a vote. 
(13)  A motion to adjourn is always in order and will be decided without second or any debate. 
(14)  The previous question will have precedence over all motions (except a motion to adjourn and a motion to lay on the table) and, if sustained by a two-thirds vote of the council, will preclude all debate and all amendments. 
(15)  Any ordinance or resolution presented to the council for consideration or action must be in writing. 
(16)  Discussion or debate on any matter may be limited to a prescribed time upon majority vote of the council. Discussion or debate of matters under consideration by the council will generally be limited to members of the council, city staff, and consultants. Members of the public may request permission, however, to speak to an issue then under consideration and may speak to the issue if permitted to do so by the council president or a majority vote of the council. Public discussion or debate permitted under this rule will be limited to three minutes per speaker unless otherwise directed by the council president or a majority of the council. Rebuttal to public comment by members of the public, with a three-minute limit, may be permitted at the discretion of the council president or a majority vote of the council. The foregoing rule will not apply to public comment permitted under subsection (17) of this section. 
(17)  Members of the public may request that the city clerk include them on the public comment portion of the official agenda by the established deadline. The deadline for inclusion on the agenda for public comments is hereby set as close of business on the Tuesday prior to the council meeting. Those making a timely request may be allowed to address the council for up to five minutes or for such longer time as allowed by the council president or a majority of the council. Comment from members of the public who have not been listed on the official agenda may be permitted and shall be limited to three minutes each or for such longer time as allowed by the council president or a majority of the council. 
(18)  Any councilmember, having voted with the majority on any question, may move for a reconsideration of the question at that meeting or at the next meeting of the council. 
(19)  No ordinance or resolution intended to be of permanent operation shall be adopted by the council at the same meeting at which it is introduced unless unanimous consent of those present is given for a suspension of the rules to allow for the immediate consideration of such ordinance or resolution. No ordinance or resolution intended to be of permanent operation shall become law unless, on its final passage, a majority of the members elected to the council vote in its favor. 
(20)  A councilmember may or may not vote on any item at his option, except as prohibited by law. See Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-43-54. Any councilmember may request that another member state publicly the reason for his vote on any matter. 
(21)  For all votes of the council, the clerk shall record the "yeas" and "nays." 
(22)  Any member of the council has the right to have his protest to the passage of any measure entered on the minutes, provided that it is made in respectful language, of which the council president will be the judge. 
(23)  Nothing will be introduced as a rider or as a condition or qualification to any ordinance unless the same shall be pertinent to the subject of the ordinance. 
(24)  A majority of any committee of the council shall be sufficient to make a recommendation to the council. 
(25)  The president of the council may, at his discretion, call any member to take the chair temporarily to allow the president to address the council, make a motion, or discuss any other matter at issue. 
(26)  If any councilmember willfully violates any of these rules, he shall suffer such censure as the council may direct. Any censure must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the remaining councilmembers. Censure may include a fine, public criticism, and/or admonition. 
(27)  If any vacancy should occur in the office of mayor, then such vacancy will be filled in accordance with Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-43-42. Vacancies in the office of councilmember will be filled in accordance with Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-43-4. 
(28)  The clerk-treasurer, city attorney, city engineer, chief of police, fire chief, and such other officers or employees of the city, when requested by the mayor or council president, shall attend meetings of the council and shall remain in attendance for such length of time as the council may direct. 
(29)  Every officer whose duty it is to report at the regular meetings of the council, and who is in default thereof, may be fined at the discretion of the council. 
(30)  All meetings of the council shall be open to the public, except when the council meets in executive session as authorized by state law. When a councilmember makes a motion to go into executive session for a stated purpose and the motion is seconded, the council president shall put the motion to a vote. If the majority of the council votes in favor of the motion, the body will then move into executive session to discuss the matter for which the executive session was called. No action or any vote shall be taken in an executive session. Discussion in the executive session shall be limited to the purpose for which it was called. When the discussion of such matters has been completed, the council shall return from the executive session and upon a majority vote shall resume its public session. The council may then resume or conclude deliberations or take such action as appropriate. 
(31)  The rules of the council may be temporarily suspended by a vote of two-thirds of the members present.

(a)  All resolutions or ordinances intended to be of permanent operation, after having been passed by the council, shall be transmitted by the clerk within 48 hours after passage to the mayor for consideration. To approve said resolutions or ordinances, the mayor shall sign them and return them to the clerk, who shall publish them. Unless otherwise stated, resolutions or ordinances shall be effective upon approval by the mayor, except that ordinances requiring publication shall be effective when published. The council, however, may provide in a resolution or ordinance that it shall be effective at some other time if permitted by law. 
(b)  The council may recall an ordinance or resolution from the mayor at any time before it has become a law or has been acted on by the mayor. To recall an ordinance or resolution, the council must adopt a recall resolution by a majority of all members of the council.

    If the mayor disapproves of any resolution or ordinance transmitted to him, the mayor shall, within ten calendar days of the time of its passage by the council, return it to the clerk with written objections. The clerk shall report the mayor's veto at the next regular meeting of the city council. At that time, if two-thirds of the members of the council shall adhere to said resolution or ordinance, notwithstanding the mayor's veto, then such resolution or ordinance shall have the force of law after publication, unless by its term it was to take effect on its approval, in which event it shall take effect upon its passage over the mayor's veto. The failure of the mayor to return to the clerk a resolution or ordinance with the mayor's veto within ten calendar days of its passage by the council shall operate and have the same effect as an approval of the same, and the clerk shall then publish the same, if publication is required by law. 
(Code 1992, § 2-29; Ord. No. 2005-242, § 10, 10-10-2005; Ord. No. 2008-283, § 10, 11-3-2008)

    Ordinances or resolutions fixing salaries of employees and officers of the city shall be submitted to the mayor as other ordinances and resolutions are to be submitted, but may be approved in part and vetoed as to specific items, as stated in the mayor's veto message. In the case of the veto of specific items and approval of the remainder of said ordinance or resolution by the mayor, the clerk, at the next regular meeting of the council, shall present the mayor's veto to the council with the question, "Shall the ordinance (or resolution) pass, the veto of the mayor notwithstanding?" If two-thirds of the members of the council do not vote for the passage of said ordinance or resolution, the veto notwithstanding, then the clerk shall submit to the council the following question: "Shall the ordinance stand as approved by the mayor?" If a majority of the members of the council vote in the affirmative to that question, the law as amended and approved by the mayor shall have the force and effect of law; otherwise such salary resolution or ordinance shall be defeated.

(a)  The owner or person in charge of every dog and cat in the city more than three months of age shall register each animal as to sex, breed, description, owner's name and address, and the animal's name, if any. Registration may be done annually or tri-annually. At the time of such registration, such owner or person in charge shall, only after providing proof of valid rabies vaccination of either one year or three years, obtain a license for such dog or cat and shall pay a license fee. The amount of the license fee shall be as established by the mayor and city council, from time to time. Any owner claiming that his dog or cat has been spayed or neutered must show to the satisfaction of the licensing authority that such operation has been performed. 
(b)  Upon the written recommendation of a licensed veterinarian, a waiver may be granted to the rabies vaccination requirement when it is determined that age or health reasons may prevent an animal from safely receiving the same. 
(c)  Each owner or person in charge of every dog or cat in the city who is required by the terms of this section to register said animal shall have 90 days from the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived to register said animal as required by this section. For any dog or cat acquired after the effective date, the owner or person in charge thereof shall register said animal within 30 days of the animal entering the city.

Upon payment of the annual license fee, the city will issue a metal tag for each individual animal for no additional fee. The owner of each private kennel will be responsible for timely informing the city of the addition or removal of any animals from the kennel during each registration year. Failure to so inform the city of the addition of animals to any private kennel within 30 days will subject the owner of the kennel to an individual licensing requirement for each animal in the kennel as provided in this section. If timely reported, however, a license tag will be issued by the city for each new animal added to the kennel during the registration year at no additional cost. This provision will not apply to owners of commercial kennels.

(d)  Utility crossings. All underground utility crossings of existing streets shall be completed by boring or by jack and bore method. Open cut crossings of existing streets will only be allowed with written approval of the directors of both the public works and engineering departments. 
(e)  Surface restoration. The final requirement of any permit issued pursuant to this section, regardless of whether it is specifically stated therein, is that the surface of the affected roadway must be restored immediately upon completion of the permitted work. In addition to the street paving specifications promulgated by the engineering department, guidelines for such restoration are based on the scope of the repair project as quantified by the overall length and/or width of the project area. 
(1)  For utility work requiring surface restoration of one-third or less of the length of the affected area as measured between public intersections encompassing the whole of the project, patching of the openings may be acceptable, subject to the provisions of subsections (e)(3) and (e)(4) of this section. 
(2)  For utility work requiring surface restoration of greater than one-third of the length of the affected area as measured between public intersections encompassing the whole of the project, resurfacing of the entire length of the project may be required, subject to the provisions of subsections (e)(3) and (e)(4) of this section. 
(3)  For utility work requiring surface restoration inside one traffic lane only, that lane shall be resurfaced ten feet on each side of the opening as measured from the centerline of the cut. 
(4)  For utility work requiring surface restoration across two or more traffic lanes, the entire width of the right-of-way shall be resurfaced ten feet on each side of the opening as measured from the centerline of the cut. 
All resurfacing projects, regardless of their extent, must be approved by the public works director before work may begin. 
(f)  Emergency repairs. In the event emergency repairs to existing underground utility infrastructure located in city right-of-way must be initiated outside of the regular business hours established for the city public works department, the person or entity initiating such work must follow the procedures set forth by the public works department to provide timely and sufficient notice and information to the department regarding the work being done in the right-of-way. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "emergency repair" means any underground repair which is designed and intended to immediately restore water, power, sewer, gas, cable, or telephone service to any current customer or customers having lost service for any reason other than delinquency in payment. All emergency repairs will be subject to inspection and testing by the city to the greatest extent possible and each must meet or exceed the accepted utility backfill processes established and promulgated by the public works department and the engineering department. 
(g)  Permit fee; exceptions. There is hereby established and set a non-refundable fee in the amount of $50.00 which must accompany the submission of any application for issuance of a permit for installation and maintenance of utilities inside street rights-of-way by the public works department. Excepted from the requirement to pay such fee are all public utilities and any private utility lawfully operating under the terms of a valid franchise agreement which allows their operation within the city's rights-of-way. 
(h)  Saving provision. This section shall not be construed to authorize the violation of any other applicable law, ordinance or regulation. Compliance with the city's construction specifications manual, grading ordinance, and all other applicable ordinances is required in the performance of any work performed in the city, whether or not covered by this section.

(a)  The municipal designee shall have the authority to investigate all applications and may refer any application to the municipal governing body for a determination of whether such license should or should not be issued. 
(b)  If the municipal governing body denies the issuance of any license referred to it, the municipal clerk shall promptly notify the applicant of the municipal governing body's decision. 
(c)  If said applicant desires to appear before the municipal governing body to show cause why said license should be issued, he shall file a written notice with the municipal clerk, said notice to be filed within two weeks from the date of mailing by the municipal clerk of the notice of the denial of such license by the municipal governing body. 
(d)  Upon receipt of said notice the municipal clerk shall promptly schedule a hearing, to be held within 15 days from the date of receipt of such notice, before the municipal governing body and shall give the notice of the date, time and place of said hearing to the applicant. 
(e)  The applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear personally, or through his counsel, or both, and the municipal governing body shall proceed to hear any evidence which may be presented both for and against the issuance of said license. 
(f)  If the municipal governing body determines from the evidence presented that in order to either provide for the safety, preserve the health, promote the prosperity, or improve the morals, order, comfort and convenience of the inhabitants of the municipality said license should not be granted, it shall enter an order to that effect; otherwise, said license shall be ordered issued upon payment of any required license fees.

Sec. 10-22. - Procedure for revocation or suspension of license.

(b)  The conditions set forth in subsection (a) of this section as grounds for the revocation of a license shall also constitute grounds for refusing to renew a license. 
(c)  The municipal governing body shall set a time for hearing on the matter of revoking or refusing to renew a license; and a notice of such hearing shall be given to the licensee, or the applicant for renewal, as the case may be, at least ten days before the day set for said hearing.

(Code 1992, § 7-22; Ord. No. 2007-119, § 22, 5-29-2007) 
Sec. 10-23. - Refunds on overpayments. 
(a)  Any taxpayer may file a petition for refund with the municipality for any overpayment of business license tax erroneously paid to the municipality. If a final assessment for the tax has been entered by the municipality a petition for refund of all or a portion of the tax may be filed only if the final assessment has been paid in full prior to or simultaneously with the filing of the petition for refund. 
(b)  A petition for refund shall be filed with the municipality within two years from the date of payment of the business license tax, which is the subject of the petition. 
(c)  The municipality shall either grant or deny a petition for refund within six months from the date the petition is filed, unless the period is extended by written agreement of the taxpayer and the municipality. The taxpayer shall be notified of the municipality's decision concerning the petition for refund by first class U.S. mail or by certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested, sent to the taxpayer's last known address. If the municipality fails to grant a full refund within the time provided herein, the refund petition shall be deemed to be denied. 
(d)  If the petition is granted or the municipality or a court otherwise determines that a refund is due, the overpayment shall be promptly refunded to the taxpayer by the municipality, together with interest to the extent provided for in Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-51-92. If the municipality determines that a refund is due, the amount of overpayment plus any interest due thereon may first be credited by the municipality against any outstanding tax liabilities due and owing by the taxpayer to the municipality, and the balance of any overpayment shall be promptly refunded to the taxpayer. If any refund or part thereof is credited to any other tax by the municipality, the taxpayer shall be provided with a written detailed statement showing the amount of overpayment, the amount credited for payment to other taxes, and the resulting amount of the refund. 
(e)  A taxpayer may appeal from the denial in whole or in part of a petition for refund by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the circuit court of the county in which the municipality denying the petition for refund is located. Said notice of appeal must be filed within two years from the date the petition was denied. The circuit court shall hear the appeal according to its own rules and procedures and shall determine the correct amount of refund due, if any. If an appeal is not filed with the appropriate circuit court within two years of the date the petition was denied, then the appeal shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
(Code 1992, § 7-23; Ord. No. 2007-119, § 23, 5-29-2007) 
Sec. 10-24. - Delivery license. 
(a)  In lieu of any other type of license, a taxpayer may, at his option, purchase for $100.00 plus the issuance fee, a delivery license for the privilege of delivering his merchandise in the municipality if the taxpayer meets all of the following criteria: 
(1)  Other than deliveries, the taxpayer has no other physical presence within the municipality or its police jurisdiction; 
(2)  The taxpayer conducts no other business in the municipality other than delivering merchandise and performing the requisite set-up and installation of said merchandise; 
(3)  Such delivery and setup and installation is performed by the taxpayer's employees or agents, concerns the taxpayer's own merchandise in that municipality, and is done by means of delivery vehicles owned, leased, or contracted by the taxpayer; 
(4)  The gross receipts derived from the sale and any requisite setup or installation of all merchandise so delivered shall not exceed $75,000.00 during the license year; 
(5)  Any setup or installation shall relate only to that required by the contract between the taxpayer and the customer or as may be required by state or local law, and the merchandise so delivered; 
(6)  If at any time during the current license year the taxpayer fails to meet any of the above-stated criteria, then within ten days after any of said criteria have been violated or exceeded, the taxpayer shall purchase all appropriate business licenses from the municipality for the entire license year and without regard to this section. 
(b)  Mere delivery of the taxpayer's merchandise by common carrier shall not allow the municipality to assess a business license tax against the taxpayer, but the gross receipts derived from any sale and delivery accomplished by means of a common carrier shall be counted against the $75,000.00 limitation described in the preceding section if the taxpayer also during the same license year sells and delivers into the taxing jurisdiction using a delivery vehicle other than a common carrier. 
(c)  A common carrier, contract carrier, or similar delivery service making deliveries on behalf of others shall not be entitled to purchase a delivery license. 
(d)  The delivery license shall be calculated in arrears, based on the related gross receipts during the preceding license year. 
(e)  The purchase of a delivery license shall not, in and of itself, establish nexus between the taxpayer and the municipality for purposes of the taxes levied by or under the authority of Title 40 of the Code of Alabama 1975 or other provisions of law, nor does the purchase of a delivery license conclusively determine that nexus does not exist between the taxpayer and the municipality.

Each month of failure to make such reports shall constitute a separate offense and each refusal of a written demand of the city revenue department to examine, inspect or audit such records shall constitute a separate offense. 
(c)  Procedures governing entry of assessments. 
(1)  If the city determines that the amount of any tax as reported on a return is incorrect, if no return is filed or if full payment of tax penalties and interest, if any, is not remitted with any return required to be filed, the city is authorized to calculate the correct tax or value based upon the most accurate and complete information reasonably obtainable by the city. Upon determination by the city of the correct tax due or upon failure of the taxpayer to remit payment of tax with any return required to be filed, the city shall send a notice and demand for payment of tax to the taxpayer at the taxpayer's last known address. If the taxpayer fails or refuses to pay the amount of tax, penalties and interest, if any, as set forth in such notice and demand for payment of tax within 30 days from the date of mailing of such notice of demand, the city may thereafter enter a preliminary assessment of the correct tax or value upon appropriate record, including any applicable penalty and interest. Where the amount of tax or value reported on a return is undisputed by the city or the taxpayer consents in writing to amount of any deficiency, determination of value or preliminary assessment, the city may immediately enter a final assessment for the amount of said tax or value, plus applicable penalty and interest. At any time, the city may enter a final jeopardy assessment as provided pursuant to the provisions of Code of Ala. 1975, §§ 40-17A-12, 40-29-90 and 40-29-91. 
(2)  Any preliminary assessment must be entered by the city within three years from the due date of the taxpayer's return, or three years from the date the taxpayer's return is filed with the city, whichever is later, or if no return is required to be filed, within three years of the due date of the tax, provided that a preliminary assessment may be entered at any time if no return is filed as required, or if a false or fraudulent return is filed with the intent to evade tax, and a preliminary assessment may be entered within six years from the due date of the return of any taxpayer or six years from the date the return is filed with the city, whichever is later, if such return omits more than 25 percent of the correct amount of tax required to be shown on said return, provided further, the time for entering a preliminary assessment shall be suspended during the 30-day period during which a notice and demand for payment of tax has been issued to the taxpayer by the city. Notice of the entry of preliminary assessment entered by the city, or a copy thereof shall be promptly mailed by the city to the taxpayer's last known address by either first class United States mail, postage prepaid, certified mail with return receipt requested, or personal delivery upon the taxpayer. 
(3)  If a taxpayer disagrees with a preliminary assessment as entered by the city, the taxpayer may file a written petition for review with the city within 30 days from the date of entry of the preliminary assessment setting out the specific objections to the preliminary assessment. Upon receipt of a timely filed petition for review, the city shall schedule a conference with the taxpayer for the purpose of allowing the taxpayer and the city to present their respective positions, discuss any omissions or errors and to attempt to agree upon any changes or modifications to their respective positions. If a written petition for review is not timely filed or, upon proper and timely filing, it is determined by the city that the preliminary assessment is due to be upheld in whole or in part the city may make the assessment final in the amount of tax due as computed by the city, with applicable interest and penalty computed to the date of entry of the final assessment. Such final assessment entered by the city or a copy thereof shall be mailed by the city to the taxpayer by: 
a.  First class United States mail, postage prepaid; 
b.  Certified mail with return receipt requested; or 
c.  Personal delivery upon the taxpayer. 
(4)  Any taxpayer, who has duly appeared and filed a timely written petition for review of any preliminary assessment, dissatisfied with the final assessment may file a notice of appeal with the circuit court of the county within 30 days from the date of entry of the final assessment by the city. 
(d)  Procedure governing petitions for refund. 
(1)  Any taxpayer may file a petition for refund with the city for any overpayment of tax or other amount erroneously paid to the city or concerning any refund which the city is required to administer; provided, if a final assessment for the tax has been entered by the city, a petition for refund of all or a portion of the tax may be filed only if the final assessment plus applicable interest has been paid in full prior to or with the filing of such petition for refund. 
(2)  A petition for refund must be filed with the city within three years from the date the return was filed or within two years from the date of payment of the tax, whichever is later; or, if no return was timely filed, two years from the date of payment of the tax. 
(3)  The city must either grant or deny a petition for refund within six months from the date the petition for refund is filed unless said period is extended by written agreement by the taxpayer and the city. The city shall notify the taxpayer of the city's decision concerning the petition for refund by sending a copy of the same by either: 
a.  First class United States mail, postage prepaid; or 
b.  By certified mail, return receipt requested, sent to the taxpayer's last known address. 
In the event the city fails to grant a refund within the time provided herein, said petition for refund shall be deemed to be denied. 
(4)  If the city determines that a refund is due and the taxpayer's petition for refund is due to be granted, the amount of overpayment plus accrued interest may first be credited by the city against any outstanding final tax liabilities due and owing by the taxpayer to the city, and the balance of such overpayment, if any, shall be refunded to the taxpayer. If any refund or part thereof is credited to any other tax by the city, the city shall provide a written detailed statement to the taxpayer showing the amount of overpayment, the amount credited for payment to other taxes and the amount refunded. 
(5)  A taxpayer may appeal from the denial in whole or in part of a petition for refund by filing a notice of appeal with the circuit court of the county, within two years from the date the petition for refund is denied. If such appeal is not filed with the circuit court of the county within two years from the date such petition for refund is denied, then such appeal shall be dismissed for lack of prosecution jurisdiction.

On or before the 20th day of the month, any person on whom the taxes levied by this article are imposed shall render to the city, on a return form prescribed by the city, a true and correct statement showing the amount and quantity of all gasoline and of all motor fuel sold or delivered by such distributor or seller within the corporate limits of the city for the next preceding month. At the time of making such monthly reports, such person shall compute the taxes due and shall pay to the city the amount of taxes shown to be due. 
(2)  It shall be the duty of every person engaging, or continuing, in this city for which a privilege tax is imposed by this article, to keep and preserve suitable records of the amount and quantity of all gasoline and of all motor fuel sold and such other books or accounts as may be necessary to determine the amount of tax for which such person is liable under the provisions of this article. 
(3)  The monthly reports herein required to be made are not required to be made on oath, but wherever in this article any report is required to be sworn to, the same shall be sworn to by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's agent before some officer authorized to administer oaths, and any false statement of material fact knowingly made shall constitute perjury, and upon conviction thereof the person so convicted shall be punished as provided by law. 
(4)  Any person subject to the provisions of this article who shall fail to make the reports or any of them, as herein required, or who shall fail to keep the records as herein required, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall not be fined less than $25.00, nor more than $100.00, for each offense. Each month of such failure shall constitute a separate offense. 
(5)  Any person subject to the provisions of this article willfully refusing to make the reports herein required, or who shall refuse to permit the examination of such person's records by the city, or its authorized agents, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall not be fined less than $25.00, nor more than $100.00, and in addition may be imprisoned for a period not to exceed six months. Each month of failure to make such reports shall constitute a separate offense, and each refusal of a written demand by the city to examine, inspect or audit such records shall constitute a separate offense. 
(6)  As soon as practicable after the return is filed, the city shall examine it and ascertain the proper amount of the tax due as shown by the return. If the amount paid is greater than the amount due, as shown by the return, the excess shall be refunded or credited to the taxpayer, or credited on any deficiency previously due by the taxpayer, in accordance with the law and under such rules as the city may adopt or promulgate. If the amount paid is less than the amount due, as shown by the return, the city shall immediately notify the taxpayer of such deficiency and shall add thereto a penalty of ten percent of the amount due, and if such deficiency is not paid within 30 days from the date of such notice, the same shall bear interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the date the same was due which shall be collected as part of the tax; provided the city, if good and sufficient reason is shown, may waive or remit the interest, and/or the ten percent penalty, or a fraction thereof. 
(7)  Any taxpayer who fails to pay the tax herein levied within the time required by this article shall pay, in addition to the tax, a penalty of ten percent of the amount of tax due, together with interest thereon at the rate of one-half of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the date at which the tax herein levied became due and payable, such penalty and interest therein to be assessed and collected as a part of the tax, provided that the city, if a good and sufficient reason is shown, may waive or remit the interest and/or the ten percent penalty or a fraction thereof. 
(8)  Whenever the city, when examining and auditing the records of any taxpayer, or from other information, shall ascertain that the amount or amounts previously paid by any taxpayer for any period is incorrect, the city shall compute the correct amount of tax due, and if its appears that the amount paid by the taxpayer is in excess of the amount of tax due, such excess shall be refunded or credited to the taxpayer in accordance with law and under the rules and regulations of the city. If it appears that the amount paid by the taxpayer is less than the amount due, the city shall compute the amount of such deficiency and shall notify the taxpayer, and shall demand payment therefor. If the amount demanded is not paid within ten days from the date of such demand, or if the taxpayer does not request an extension of time within ten days from the date of such demand, the city shall make an assessment against the taxpayer of the amount due and shall add interest of one-half of one percent per month from the date such taxes or any part thereof became due; provided that the city may, if good and sufficient reason is shown, waive or remit such interest or a portion thereof. If within ten days from the date of notice of deficiency the taxpayer requests in writing an extension of time, the city shall grant an extension of 30 days. If, at the end of such extended period, the deficiency has not been paid, the city shall proceed with the assessment. If the city is of the opinion that there was a willful or fraudulent intent by the taxpayer to evade the tax due, it may assess a penalty of 25 percent of the tax. 
(9)  Whenever the city shall make an assessment against a taxpayer as herein provided, the city shall notify the taxpayer by registered or certified mail from the city's authorized agent of the amount of such assessment, and shall notify the taxpayer to appear before the city on a day named not less than 20 days from the date of such notice and show cause why such assessment should not be made final. Such appearance may be made by agent or attorney. If no showing is made on or before the date fixed in such notice, or if such showing is not sufficient in the judgment of the city, such assessment shall be made final in the amount originally fixed or in such other amount as is determined by the city to be correct. If upon such hearing the city finds the amount due to be different from that originally assessed, it shall make the assessment final in the correct amount and in all cases shall notify the taxpayer of the assessment as finally fixed; provided, however, a notice by the United States mail addressed to the taxpayer's last known place of business shall be sufficient. Any assessment made by the city shall be prima facie correct upon appeal. 
(10)  Appeal of assessment. 
a.  Whenever any taxpayer who has duly appeared and protested an assessment by the city is dissatisfied with the assessment as finally made, such taxpayer may appeal to the circuit court of this county; provided, however, that no appeal shall lie in cases where the taxpayer has failed to appear and protest. 
b.  No assessment shall be made by the city against any person for any tax which becomes due from such person under the provisions of this article more than three years prior to the date the city commenced an audit of the books or records of such person to ascertain the amount due, or, if no audit is made, prior to the date the city mailed written demand for the amount claimed to be due from such person. 
(11)  The tax together with interest and penalties imposed by this article shall be a lien upon the property of any person subject to the provisions of this article.

c.  The tax collector of the city shall have the authority to promulgate reasonable rules and regulations governing the release of the information as provided in subsection (15)b of this section.

(e)  In making the findings of public convenience and necessity required by subsection (c) of this section, the city council shall take into consideration the number of taxicabs and limousines already in operation in the city, whether existing transportation is adequate to meet the public need, the probable effect of additional taxicabs or limousines on local traffic conditions and the character, experience and responsibility of the applicant and the adequacy of the service which the applicant proposes to give.

(i)  Any license issued under this section may be renewed annually for additional periods of one year, each from the date of expiration upon the certification under oath that there have been no changes in the information submitted as required by subsection (b) of this section, and upon the approval of the city clerk pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, except as to the finding by the city council of public convenience and necessity, provided, however, that no license shall be renewed after March 1 each year without reapplying therefor as herein provided and a finding by the city clerk that public convenience and necessity justify the issuance of such a license. 
(j)  Each applicant shall, before the issuance to him of a license under this section, file with the city clerk: 
(1)  A description of each motor vehicle to be operated by the applicant pursuant to the license, including the make, model, passenger seating capacity, year of manufacturer, state license number, the motor number thereof, and the name and address of the owner; and

Such policy shall not be cancelled or suspended either by the insured or the insurer unless at least 30 days notice in writing of the intention to cancel or suspend policy has been filed with the city clerk, and upon such suspension or cancellation of insurance, the taxicab or limousine license of said insured shall stand suspended until such time as an acceptable policy and certificate of insurance shall be on file with the city clerk. 
(k)  Failure to comply with subsection (j) of this section within 60 days after the adoption of a resolution by the city council of public convenience and necessity as required by subsection (c) of this section shall be deemed to be abandonment of the application and license in respect to the number of motor vehicles not so reported and not so insured pursuant to subsection (i) of this section. It shall be unlawful and cause for suspension or revocation of the applicable application and license to operate a fewer number of taxicabs than such application and license authorizes; provided, however, a taxicab shall not be deemed to be out of operation for the purposes of this subsection for a period of 60 days from the date such taxicab failed to be certified as herein provided by the chief of police. 
(l)  Any change in the information furnished in the application for a taxicab or limousine license pursuant to this article must be reported to the city clerk in writing within ten days and failure to so report shall be cause for suspension or revocation of the license.

(e)  It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a taxicab upon which has been placed tires of a smaller size than those which were on the taxicab at the time the taximeter on said taxicab was last sealed, without first having said taxicab inspected or giving notice requesting such inspection as provided for in section 10-161(b) at least 30 days previous to such operation.

The following procedures shall apply to all such purchases, not specifically excepted: 
(1)  Invitation for bids. An invitation for bids shall include specifications and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement. The invitation for bids may be amended by issuance of addenda at any time prior to the date bids are to be opened. 
(2)  Cancellation of invitations for bids or rejection of bids. An invitation for bids or other solicitation may be cancelled or any or all bids may be rejected, in whole or in part, as may be specified in the solicitation, when it is for good cause and in the best interest of the city. The reasons therefore shall be made part of the contract file. Each solicitation issued by the city shall state that the solicitation may be cancelled and that any bid or proposal may be rejected, in whole or in part, for good cause when in the best interest of the city. Notice of cancellation shall be sent to all bidders who responded to the solicitation. The notice shall indentify the solicitation, explain the reason for cancellation, and where appropriate, explain that an opportunity will be given to compete on any solicitation or any future procurement of similar items. Reasons for rejection shall be provided upon request by unsuccessful bidders. 
(3)  Public notice. All proposed purchases in excess of $15,000.00, not otherwise excepted herein, shall be advertised by posting notice thereof on a bulletin board maintained at the Madison Municipal Complex and in any other manner. The length of time for posting may be determined or required by purchasing rules or regulations adopted by the city or as deemed advisable by the purchasing agent. Sealed bids shall also be solicited by sending notice by mail to all vendors who have filed a request in writing that they be listed for solicitations on bids for such particular items as are set forth in the request. If any person whose name is listed fails to respond for any solicitation for bids after receipt of three such solicitations, such listing may be cancelled. 
(4)  Bids and performance bonds. Bid and performance bonds or other security shall be requested for supply contracts or service contracts, as the purchasing agent deems advisable to protect the city's interest, and in conformance with the state competitive bid law. Any such bonding requirements shall be set forth in the solicitation. Bid or performance bonds shall not be used as a substitute for a determination of a bidder's responsibility. Bid bonds shall be forfeited to and become the property of the city when a low responsive and responsible bidder fails or refuses to accept an award of a contract or perform in accordance with its bid unless such bid is allowed to be withdrawn as provided in this article. 
(5)  Bid opening. All bids shall be sealed when received, and shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. The amount of each bid, and such other relevant information as the purchasing agent deems appropriate, together with the name of each bidder, shall be recorded and retained as a permanent record. The record and each bid shall be open to public inspection. 
(6)  Bid acceptance and bid evaluation. Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this article. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, and based on criteria to determine acceptability, such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose. The criteria that will affect the bid price which are to be considered in evaluation for award shall be objectively measurable, such as discounts, transportation costs, and total of life cycle costs. The awarding authority or requisitioning agency shall have the right to reject any bid if the price is deemed excessive, the quality of product inferior, or if the bidder is not deemed responsible. 
(7)  Correction or withdrawal of bids; cancellation of awards. Corrections or withdrawals of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or cancellation of award or contracts based on such bid mistakes, may be permitted where appropriate. Mistakes discovered before bid opening may be modified or withdrawn by written or telegraphic notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to the time set for bid opening. After bid opening, no changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the city or fair competition shall be permitted. In lieu of bid corrections, a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid if: 
a.  A mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or 
b.  The bidder submits evidence that clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made. 
All decisions to permit the withdrawal of bids, or to cancel awards or contracts based on bid mistakes, shall be supported by a written determination made by the purchasing agent. 
(8)  Award. The contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by appropriate written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder, taking into consideration the qualities of the commodities and/or services proposed to be supplied, their conformity with specification, the purposes for which required, the terms of delivery, transportation charges, and the dates of delivery. If a bidder who otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found nonresponsible, a determination of nonresponsibility setting forth the basis of the finding shall be prepared by the purchasing agent. The failure of a bidder to supply prompt information in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility may be ground for a determination of nonresponsibility with respect to such bidder. A copy of the determination shall be sent promptly to the nonresponsible bidder. The final determination shall be made part of the contract file and be made a public record.

(b)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the respective meanings ascribed by this subsection, except when the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Facilities includes any structures or properties owned by the city, the land upon which the facility is situated for the provision of the city services, and the initial furniture, fixtures, equipment and apparatus necessary to put the facility in service. Facilities include, but are not limited to the following: administrative offices, parks, service centers and storage yards, recreation centers, libraries, fire stations. 
    Infrastructure includes facilities that are normally stationary in nature and can be preserved for a significantly greater number of years than most capital assets. Examples of infrastructure assets include roads, streets, bridges, tunnels, drainage systems and lighting systems. 
(c)  Control. All capital project expenditures must be appropriated in the capital budget. The finance department must certify the availability of such appropriations or the availability of resources so an appropriation can be made before a capital project contract is presented to the city council for approval. 
(d)  Program planning. The capital budget will include capital improvements program plans for future years. The planning time frame should normally be at least five years. The replacement and maintenance for capital items should be projected for the next five years. Future maintenance and operations will be fully cost, so that these costs can be considered in the operating budget. 
(e)  Alternate resources. Where applicable, alternate resources should be used to fund capital projects. 
(f)  Debt financing. Recognizing that debt is usually a more expensive financing method, alternative-financing sources will be explored before debt is issued. When debt is issued, it will be used to acquire major assets with expected lives, which equal or exceed the average life of the debt issue. The exceptions to this requirement are the traditional costs of marketing and issuing the debt, capitalized labor for design and construction of capital projects and small component parts which are attached to major equipment purchases. 
(g)  Infrastructure maintenance. The city recognizes that deferred street maintenance increases future capital cost by an estimated five- to ten-fold. Therefore, a portion of the gasoline taxes budget will be set aside each year to maintain the quality of streets. The amount will be established annually so that repairs will be made for an amount designated as a percentage of the value of the streets. 
(h)  Reporting. Monthly financial reports will be prepared to enable the department heads to manage their capital budgets and to enable the mayor to monitor and control the capital budget as authorized by the city council.

(c)  Equity. The revenue system of the city will strive to maintain equity in its structure. That is, the city will seek to minimize or eliminate all forms for subsidization between entities, funds, services and citizens. 
(d)  Administration. The costs of administering a revenue source should be reasonable in relation to the produced. 
(e)  Revenue adequacy. The city will require a balance in the revenue system. The revenue base will be fair and neutral regarding cost of services, willingness to pay and the ability to pay.

Of that amount, one-half mill is dedicated for public library purposes and 51/2 mill must be utilized first for payment of outstanding bonded debt of the city incurred for water and sewer improvements financed through Series 1990 warrants issued by the city. All revenue from the 51/2 mill ad valorem tax in excess of revenue required for debt 
service on the Series 1990 water and sewer warrants and all revenue from the seven mill ad valorem tax is available for general fund purposes. However, it shall be the practice of the city to apply all revenue from the 51/2 mill ad valorem tax toward the city's bonded debt service. 
(m)  Franchise agreement. The city will monitor the status of existing financial agreements and take necessary actions to negotiate new agreements to best serve the citizens of the city. 
(n)  Interest income.

(d)  Prompt payment. All invoices will be paid within 30 days of receipt. Procedures will be used to take advantage of all purchase discounts where considered cost effective. However, payments will also be reasonable delayed in order to maximize the city's investment cash, when such delay does not violate the agreed upon payment terms. 
(e)  Equipment financing. Equipment may be financed when the unit purchase price is $25,000.00 or more and the useful life is at least four years.

Where reasonably possible, accrued vacation leave can be paid by allowing a vacated position to remain open for several weeks. This reserve will be established based upon a schedule of estimated retirements, which will be developed in conjunction with the operating budget. 
(e)  Equipment replacement. The city will maintain an equipment replacement fund to replace major equipment. Funds will be transferred based on a depreciated calculation of each piece of equipment. 
(Code 1992, § 10-94; Res. No. 2004-128-R, § IX, 7-15-2004; Ord. No. 2014-222, § 1, 11-10-2014)

(Ord. No. 2010-324, § 1, 11-22-2010) 
Sec. 17-28. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Madison, Alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 2010-324, § 1, 11-22-2010) 
Sec. 17-29. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(a)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(b)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(c)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
(d)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(e)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters.

Sec. 17-70. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The Madison City Council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(e)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(f)  In reviewing such requests, the council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(g)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and, 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs/Office of Water Resources upon request. 
(h)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the zoning board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

(Ord. No. 2010-324, § 4, 11-22-2010) 
Sec. 17-100. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
(a)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 17-99(d), "Elevated buildings." 
(b)  Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any non-residential structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 17-69(f). 
(c)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
(1)  All manufactured homes placed and substantially improved on: (i) individual lots or parcels, (ii) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (iii) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (iv) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
(2)  Manufactured homes placed and substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
a.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
b.  Where no base flood elevation exists, the manufactured home chassis and supporting equipment is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength and is elevated to a maximum of 60 inches (five feet) above grade. 
(3)  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Refer: section 17-99) 
(4)  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, fully licensed and ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions; or 
b.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (c), above. 
(d)  Standards for subdivisions. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
(2)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards, and; 
(4)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser. 
(Ord. No. 2010-324, § 4, 11-22-2010) 
Sec. 17-101. - Floodways. 
(a)  Floodway: Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 17-32, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point; 
(2)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the adopted regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; 
(3)  A community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of § 65.12, and receives the approval of the administrator. 
(4)  Require, until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
(5)  Only if section 17-101(a)(2), (3), or (4), above are satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3. 
(Ord. No. 2010-324, § 4, 11-22-2010) 
Sec. 17-102. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations (Approximate A-Zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 17-32, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (Approximate A-Zones), the following provisions apply: 
(a)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 17-32, then the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 3 only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions ((b) and (d)) shall apply: 
(b)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(c)  All development in Zone A must meet the requirements of division 3, sections 17-99 and 17-100. 
(d)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Also, in the absence of a base flood elevation, a manufactured home must also meet the elevation requirements of subsection (c)(2)b, of section 17-100, in that the structure must be elevated to a maximum of 60 inches (5 feet). [Optional] Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 17-99(d) "Elevated buildings". 
The floodplain administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(Ord. No. 2010-324, § 4, 11-22-2010) 
Sec. 17-103. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO Zones). 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in section 17-32, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet (1'-3') above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(a)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 17-99(d), "Elevated buildings". 
The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(b)  New construction and the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level or two feet (if no map elevation is listed), above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 17-68(a)(3), and (b). 
(c)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
(Ord. No. 2010-324, § 4, 11-22-2010) 
Sec. 17-104. - Severability. 
    If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this article is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way effect the validity of the remaining portions of this Ordinance.

At the time fixed for receiving and considering the statement, the city council shall hear the same, together with any objections which may be raised by the owner whose property is liable to be assessed for the city's expenses in causing the abatement of the nuisance, and thereupon make modifications in the statement as deemed necessary, after which a resolution may assess the cost. The cost stated in the resolution shall constitute a lien on the property, and shall be referred to as a weed lien on the property. 
(d)  Weed lien collection. A copy of the resolution shall be given to the county revenue commissioner.

(e)  Filing of weed lien. The city clerk may also cause a certified copy of the resolution showing the weed lien to be filed for recording in the office of the judge of probate.

(e)  A failure by the city to accomplish the repair, move, or demolition of a building, structure, part of building or structure, party wall, or foundation within 180 days of the passage of the resolution ordering the same shall constitute an abdication of the council's order unless one of the following conditions is satisfied:

(2)  A court of competent jurisdiction has enjoined or otherwise halted the repair, move, or demolition;

(5)  Further action is taken by the council as provided by subsection (f) of this section. 
(f)  If for any reason an ordered repair, move, or demolition cannot be accomplished within 180 days of the passage of the resolution ordering the same, the appropriate municipal official shall make a report of the same and the length of any desired extension to the council. The clerk shall distribute a copy of the report to the members of the council. The clerk shall set the report on the proposed extension for a public hearing at a meeting of the council. The clerk shall give no less than ten days' notice of the meeting at which the proposed extension is to be considered by certified mail to all persons or entities listed in section 22-240(b)(1). Notice shall be deemed complete upon mailing. Any person, firm, or corporation having an interest in the property may be heard at the meeting as to any objection to the proposed extension or the length thereof.

In the case of a street closure, the boundary shall be construed as remaining in its location except where ownership of the vacated street is divided other than at the center, in which case, the boundary shall be construed as moving with the ownership.
c) Boundaries Indicated as Approximately Following Lot Lines, Public Property Lines, and the like shall be construed as following such lines; provided, however, that where such boundaries are adjacent to a street or alley and the zoning status of the street or alley is not indicated, the boundaries shall be construed as running to the middle of the street or alley.

The city finds that air quality may be improved by promoting walking and reducing the number of vehicular trips, if land uses are mixed together or different land uses are organized in close proximity to one another.
B. Purpose and Intent: The following specific purposes and intentions will be implemented by adopting a Mixed Use Zoning District:
1. Mix of Uses: Encourage a compatible mixture and an appropriate balance of residential, institutional, commercial, civic, and recreational uses; and create development opportunities where people can live, work, shop, meet, and play;
2. Aesthetics: Encourage a high quality of aesthetics and appearance in the built environment;
3. Pedestrian Environment: Encourage pedestrian-oriented building forms and development patterns; Provide for a pedestrian-oriented environment on streets and sidewalks; Promote public safety through the provision of pedestrian-oriented street-level uses, sufficient sidewalk widths, adequate visibility from adjacent buildings and primary pedestrian access from buildings to adjacent sidewalks; Maximize opportunities for pedestrian amenities, include parks, plazas, greenways and public art; and Provide sufficient, safe and accessible parks, plazas and greenways for active and passive enjoyment;
C. Description: The MU zoning district is not shown on the citys zoning map except by application of a land owner and approval by city as a rezoning. The district permits a wide range of medical, office, retail, service, and other uses, including certain residential development types.
D. Criteria for Rezoning to this District: In addition to criteria generally applicable for rezoning applications, as specified in Sec. 11-3-3 of this zoning ordinance, rezoning of property to the MU zoning district shall not be permitted unless the applicant for rezoning provides for the following:
1. There shall be access to/from an MU zoning district from a collector or arterial street.

A. Minor Amendments: The administrator may approve minor amendments to the Master development plan, which are in compliance with the provisions and intent of the MU zoning district, and which do not depart from the purposes of the MU zoning district. Minor amendments to the Master development plan are those determined by the administrator to not have any significant adverse effect on properties abutting the MU zoning district. Minor amendments to the Master development plan may be approved during the process of administratively approving land disturbance or development permitting. The administrator may require the applicant to provide written justification for the minor amendment if such justification is not evident within the permit application itself.
B. Major Amendments: Should the administrator determine that a requested change to or deviation from the approved Master development plan would substantially depart from the stated purposes of the Mixed Use District, or would adversely affect properties abutting the MU zoning district; the proposed change or deviation will be classified as a major amendment and will be required to undergo review and receive approval of the city as an amendment to the MU zoning district.
C. Land Use Conversions Authorized: Notwithstanding the above provisions, the applicant will be permitted, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to increase or decrease residential units or increase or decrease square footage of nonresidential building space; subject to the land use conversions in the following table (note: the conversions are designed such that a change in land use will not result in an increase in total vehicle trips according to traffic data for average trip generation rates, as specified in the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation). An increase in one category shall result in a decrease in another category in accordance with the conversion factors provided in the table below.
D. No such amendment to the land uses and the development parameters shown on the approved Master development plan shall be administratively permitted if such increase or decrease would exceed 10 percent change of the number of approved housing units or 10 percent change in the square footage of nonresidential building space. Other conversions from hotel to other land uses, from hospital to other land uses, or any other uses, may be permitted if the applicant submits a study based on ITE Trip Generation, showing no net increase in the number of total average daily trips generated between the land uses substituted there for.

Section 4-12. Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) District Regulations
4-12-1 Purpose of the TND District
The TND District is a mixed-use, planned development district. In this district, land uses and development standards are enumerated but still provide the developer with substantial flexibility to create a unique, self-contained community. The purpose of a Traditional Neighborhood Development Zoning District (TND District) is to encourage mixed-use, compact development integrating a variety of land uses within close proximity of one another. This districts intent is to provide for the traditional development practices and flexible land use alternatives, rather than prohibiting conventional development, by allowing for:
1. Human scale design options;
2. A mixture of uses, including residential, commercial, civic, and open space uses in close proximity to one another within the neighborhood;
3. A variety of housing types, residential densities, and sizes to accommodate households of all ages, sizes, and incomes;
4. The incorporation of a system of interconnected streets, roads, drives, with sidewalks and walkways, that offer multiple routes for motorists, pedestrians, for connections to existing and future developments;
5. Building design and other improvements in an arrangement, bulk, form, character and landscaping that establishes a livable, harmonious and diverse environment;
6. The incorporation of environmental features into the design;
7. The coordination of transportation systems with a hierarchy of appropriately designed facilities for pedestrians and vehicles;
8. Well-configured squares, plazas, greens, landscaped streets, preserves, greenways and parks woven into the pattern of the neighborhood;
9. The incorporation of architecture, landscaping, lighting and signage standards integrated with the zoning provisions that contribute to the intended design character of the planned development.
4-12-2 Applicability of Other Codes and Ordinances
The Madison Code of Ordinances, Zoning Ordinance, and Subdivision Regulations (Other Codes and Ordinances) for the City apply to a TND District unless the ordinance authorizing TND zoning expressly provides otherwise.
4-12-3 Approval Process for the TND District
In association with a request for TND zoning, the following steps shall be completed.
1. A pre-application conference, as set forth below.
2. Application for a Zoning Map Amendment and submittal of a Final Concept Plan
Prior to the issuance of any permits for development within a TND District, the following steps shall be completed according to the procedures outlined in this section.
1. Approval of a layout plan, preliminary plat and final plat as provided for in the Subdivision Regulations and site plan(s) as provided for in Section 5-2-1 of this Zoning Ordinance
A. Pre-Application Conference
The pre-application conference shall be held between the applicant and the Technical Review Committee for the purpose of exchanging information providing guidance to the applicant and

determining the eligibility of the request for consideration as a Traditional Neighborhood Development.
a. A request for a pre-application conference shall be made to the Planning Department. The applicant shall submit digital copy of the Preliminary Concept Plan, at least five (5) days in advance of the pre-application conference.

Section 4-14. Water Supply Protection District
The Water Supply Protection District is created for the purpose of promoting the public health, safety, and welfare through the protection of public water supplies from the danger of water pollution. Regulations within the district are established to prevent water quality degradation due to pollutant loadings within aquifer recharge areas and with the watersheds of surface public water supplies. This district shall be in addition to and shall overlay all other zoning districts where it is applied, so that any parcel of land lying in such an overlay district shall lie in one or more other zoning districts provided for by the Zoning Ordinance. The effect is to create a new district that has the characteristics and limitations of the underlying district, together with the characteristics and limitations of the overlying district. Within the Water Supply Protection District, two areas shall be designated, to be known as Area 1 and Area 2. Area 1 shall be the area where the most stringent protection of the water supply is necessary, and shall normally be in relatively close proximity to a wellhead. Area 2 shall encompass all other areas in the Water Supply Protection District.
Regulations within such an overlay district are intended to provide a means for specific review and approval of residential, commercial, industrial and other development proposals that may have adverse water quality impacts; to encourage land uses and activities which will be compatible with water quality protection; and to assure that structures and uses within such overlay districts will be developed in a manner that will serve the health, safety and welfare objectives of preserving the environmental integrity of public water supplies.

a. Number of driveways:
i. One driveway shall be permitted for ingress and egress purposes to any plot.
ii. A joint access driveway shall be considered as adequate access for any 2 adjacent plots and shall be encouraged. For a plot where more than 1 driveway is requested, the applicant shall submit a traffic report justifying the need, describing the internal circulation and parking system, and identifying the impact of the development of the plot and its proposed access facilities on the operation of the street system.
iii. Two or more driveways entering the same street from a single plot may be permitted if all applicable requirements of this section are met
b. Ingress lanes:
i. Ingress left-turn lane requirements: A 12-foot-wide left-turn lane with appropriate storage and transition shall be provided at each driveway where the peak hour inbound left-turn volume is 30 vehicles or more. As an alternative, ingress left-turn lanes may be required when warranted according to a study performed by the project engineer, based on professionally accepted standards, and approved by the City Engineer.
ii. Ingress right-turn lanes: For any plot, a 12-foot-wide right-turn lane with appropriate storage and transition shall be provided at each driveway where the highway average daily traffic exceeds 10,000 vehicles per day, permitted highway speeds exceed 35 miles per hour, and driveway volume exceeds 1,000 vehicles per day with at least 40 right-turn movements per hour during peak periods. For any plot, a right-turn lane as described in this paragraph shall be provided at each driveway where right-turn ingress volumes exceed 75 vehicles per peak hour. As an alternative, ingress right-turn lanes may be required when warranted according to a study performed by the project engineer, based on professionally accepted standards, and approved by the City Engineer.
c. Required improvements to intersections impacted by development. Improvements to an intersection shall be required to be constructed by the developer of any plot where the development causes the intersection to be impacted by traffic generated as a result of the development. Intersection improvements shall be in accord with the requirements set forth in this section.
d. Median openings. To assure traffic safety, capacity and control, median openings located within a traffic way corridor shall be spaced the maximum distance apart that will allow safe and adequate traffic circulations

6. Adopted design guidelines.
ii. Public streets shall be given priority consideration for median openings.
iii. All median openings shall include adequate storage and transition lanes, where warranted.
e. Off-street vehicular circulation. An off-street facility shall have full internal vehicular circulation and storage. Vehicle circulation shall be completely contained within the facility, and vehicles located within one portion of the facility shall have access to all other portions without using the adjacent street system.
f. Off-street truck maneuvering. Where the use of a plot includes a truck loading, unloading, parking or service facility, adequate space shall be provided such that all truck maneuvering is performed off the street.
g. Off-street vehicle stacking areas. Adequate stacking capacity shall be required for both inbound and outbound vehicles to facilitate the safe and efficient movement between the street and the parking facility. An inbound reservoir shall be of sufficient size to ensure that vehicles will not obstruct the adjacent street, sidewalk and circulation within the facility. An outbound reservoir shall be required to eliminate backup and delay of vehicles within the facility.
h. Special considerations and exceptions. In the case of special driveway needs such as service stations, drive-in banks or other high-volume traffic uses, or where property is of a nature that the requirements of this Code cannot be met, an applicant may submit a traffic engineering study requesting technical deviation from these requirements. The traffic engineering study shall be performed and certified by a registered professional engineer qualified in traffic engineering. The study will set forth all traffic operations and safety features and minimizes the impact of the special driveway or technical deviation. Based upon the study, and upon the recommendation of the City Engineer, driveways may be approved by the Planning Commission where necessary and in such a manner as to minimize the impact on the adjacent street.
i. Administration.
i. All applications for driveway and median cut permits shall be made to the Community Development Department, which shall bring the permit application to the Planning Commission along with a recommendation thereon at the Commissions next scheduled meeting. Only the Planning Commission shall have the authority to grant any permit required by this section. The City shall collect a permit fee of $50.00 to process the application.
ii. The approval of a site plan certificate, site plan amendment, or other development order by the Planning Commission clearly depicting a proposed driveway shall serve as the required
The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison
Updated July 2019
114
permit for any driveway so depicted, and no separate permit fee will be collected. Provided that, median cuts shall require the explicit approval of the Planning Commission by affirmative vote and a separate permit fee will be collected.
j. Application to existing driveways and off-street parking facilities:
i. Any driveway or off-street parking facility existing on the effective date of this ordinance, and which by the terms of this section has become a nonconforming driveway or off-street parking facility is hereby declared not to be in violation of this section, subject to the conditions following herein.
ii. In the event of an expansion of an existing use for which a nonconforming driveway and off-street parking facility has been constructed, the provisions of this section shall apply; and the expanded use shall make necessary compliance with the terms and conditions of this section.
iii. If an existing driveway or off-street parking facility can be brought into conformance with the requirements of this section by minor alterations to the site, then, if a change on the site is made which necessitates the issuance of a building permit, the adjustments and alterations shall be made on the site to conform with the provisions of this section.
2. Improvement.
a. Surfacing, Marking, and Drainage: All off-street parking spaces required by this ordinance and intended for use by the public or by employees, and their access roads within the parking area and leading from the street to said area, shall be paved with an all-weather surface of asphaltic concrete, portland cement concrete or any equivalent material acceptable to the Administrative Officer, and maintained such that no dust will result from continued use. Spaces intended primarily for the parking or storage of heavy equipment, trucks (excluding pickup trucks), or other vehicles not classified as passenger cars by the National Highway Transportation Safety Board need not be paved; however, areas intended primarily for parking of such vehicles shall be spread with gravel of a size, weight and thickness acceptable to the City Engineer. All Spaces shall be arranged and marked so as to provide for orderly and safe parking. Drainage shall be provided to dispose of all surface water without crossing sidewalks.
b. Barriers/Bumpers: Except for parking areas provided for single-family and two-family units, suitable barriers or curbs shall be provided to protect sidewalks. Wheel or bumper guards shall be located so that no part of any vehicle shall extend beyond the parking area, intrude on pedestrian ways, or come in contact with walls, fences or plantings. As an alternative to requiring wheel stops, the Planning Commission may permit the widening of walks and landscaped areas to a minimum of six feet, where such widening will serve to protect walls, fences and landscaping in a substantially similar manner as wheel stops. Any increase in open space made necessary by the substitution of open space in lieu of wheel stops shall not be counted as open space in the calculation thereof for the project site, nor shall said areas be counted toward the minimum open space requirements for the zoning district in which the development is located. Areas of open space substituted for required wheel stops shall be identified on the site plan, and their cumulative area computed and noted on the site plan.

Section 5-16. Off-street Loading Provisions
Off-street loading facilities are required by this Ordinance so that vehicles engaged in unloading will not encroach on, or interfere with, the public use of streets and alleys and so that adequate space is available for the unloading and loading of goods, and materials.
5-16-1 Minimum Space Requirement
Off-street loading spaces shall be provided and maintained as follows:
a. Each retail store, storage warehouse, wholesale establishment, industrial plant, factory, freight terminal, market, restaurant, mortuary, laundry, dry cleaning establishment, or similar use which has an aggregate floor area of:
15-16-2 Other Factors Determining Off-street Loading Requirements
1. Fractional Spaces: When determination of the number of spaces required by this Ordinance results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction less than one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded and any fraction of one-half (1/2) or more shall require one space.
2. Enlarged/Changed Use: From the effective date of this Ordinance, if such land, structures, or uses are enlarged, expanded, or changed, there shall be provided for the increment only of such land, structures, and uses enlarged, expanded or changed and maintained as herein required, at least the amount of off-street loading space that would be required hereunder if the increment were a separate land, structure, or use. However, where a lot with an existing structure is cleared and a new structure constructed thereon, there shall be provided and maintained off-street loading space as required herein.
3. Joint Use: When an off-street loading space is used jointly by two or more uses with different requirements, or two or more uses having the same requirement, an area shall be provided equal to the total of requirements of all the uses.
5-16-3 Development of Off-street Loading Facilities
1. Plans: An applicant for a building permit must submit plans showing the off-street loading required by this Ordinance, for any use or structure required to provide off-street loading facilities. The plan shall accurately designate the required off-street loading spaces, access thereto, dimensions and clearance.

Section 5-17. Airport Influence Area
All land lying within the NEF 30 or higher noise contour as designated on the Official Zoning Map, City of Madison, is subject to special development regulations for the purpose of protection of the general health, safety and welfare of the public. In the case of any noise sensitive land uses within the NEF 30 or greater corridor, the potential buyer or builder shall be advised of the special requirements for development within this area as outlined in the Madison Subdivision Regulations.
Section 5-18. Required Buffers
(Ord. 96-02)
The use of properly planted and maintained buffer areas may reduce and ease potential incompatibility between or among different uses of land in proximity to each other.
5-18-1 Requirements
Landscaped buffers are required wherever two different zoning districts are adjacent to one another. The width of these buffers depends on the nature of the adjacency; that is, which two districts are adjacent to one another. The width requirements are enumerated in Section 5-18-5 below. In addition, buffers must meet the following requirements:
1. The landscaped buffer area shall not be less than the width specified in the Sec. 5-18-5 measured at right angles to property lines and shall be established along the entire length of and contiguous to the designated property line or lines.
2. The area shall be so designed, planted, and maintained as to be eighty (80) percent or more opaque between two (2) and six (6) feet above average ground level when viewed horizontally, unless otherwise specified in the appropriate district regulations.
3. Types and numbers of plantings for landscaped buffers shall be submitted with application for a building permit, along with plans and statements demonstrating how the buffer will be irrigated in the future. No building permit or site plan certificate shall be issued without such data, where this Ordinance requires a landscaped buffer area or areas.
4. Plantings shall be of a size and type which will insure the meeting of the eighty (80) percent opacity requirement within no longer than twelve (12) months of the date of first planting. Where questions may arise as to the suitability of proposed plant materials to meet this requirement, final determination of suitability shall be made by the Planning Commission. Eighty-percent opacity must be maintained year-round.
5. Failure to maintain the landscaped buffer area as set out above shall be a violation of this Ordinance.
5-18-2 Substitution for Landscaped Buffer Area
When expressly authorized by the Planning Commission, a six (6) foot high opaque structure set in a five (5) foot wide landscaped buffer area may be substituted for the six (6) foot high, planted buffer in Subsection 5-18-1.
5-18-3 Exception to Requirement
Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to require a landscaped buffer adjacent to a road depicted on the Citys Major Road Plan. In addition, the Planning Commission may, by majority vote, waive any buffering requirement with respect to lot lines adjacent to any public street. (ord. 98-02)
The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison
Updated July 2019
125
5-18-4 Zoning Determines Buffer
Landscaped buffers shall be constructed by, and located on the lot zoned for the more intensive use. The Table in Section 5-18-5 below shall be used to determine which use is more intensive, with the least intensive uses on the left side of the horizontal axis of the Table, and the most intensive uses on the right side of the horizontal axis. In the case where an existing "more intensive" use adjoins a lower intensity district, but has not provided the required landscaped buffer, the less intensive use, when developed, may provide the buffer, at the option of the less intensive use.
5-18-5 Minimum Landscape Buffer Widths
Minimum landscape buffer Widths shall be established according to the following table. Where district regulations in Chapter 4 of this Ordinance require a different buffer width, the requirements in Chapter 4 will control. All required buffers are in addition to yard requirements:

Section 5-18A. Sidewalks
(Ord. 97-50)
5-18A-1 Sidewalks Required
At the time of site plan approval, the Planning Commission shall require the construction of 5 ft. wide concrete sidewalks along the adjacent public City street frontage for any project subject to the provisions of Section 5-2 of the zoning ordinance, unless a sidewalk exists at the time the site plan is approved. In the event that the project fronts on two streets depicted on the adopted Future Transportation Network Map in the Comprehensive Plan, sidewalks shall be provided on both streets. In the event that the project fronts on two streets, only one of which is depicted on the adopted Future Transportation Network Plan in the Comprehensive Plan, sidewalks shall be provided on the street so depicted, and, should the Planning Commission so require, also on the other street. Sidewalks shall be installed on public right-of-way. However, the Planning Commission shall in no case require the installation of sidewalks on State-owned right-of-way or along State Roads. When right-of-way is not available, the Planning Commission may require the installation of sidewalks in a sidewalk easement in the front yard on the site, in such location and configuration as to connect to existing or future sidewalks on adjacent parcels. However, sidewalks may not be installed in a front yard without the explicit approval of the Planning Commission.
5-18A-2 Waiver by Planning Commission
1. When the installation of sidewalks is, in the judgment of the Planning Commission, impractical, unjustifiable, or otherwise not in the public interest, the Planning Commission shall have the authority to waive this requirement.
2. Sidewalks shall not be required adjacent to parcels which are zoned M-1 or M-2. (ord. 98-74)
5-18A-3 Sidewalks in Buffer Areas
Where the Planning Commission permits sidewalks or other walkways designed for pedestrian traffic to be placed within buffer areas required by Section 5-18 or any zoning district regulations, the width of the buffer will be increased 1 ft. for every foot of width of the sidewalk.

Section 5-19. Storm Water Management, Drainage, Erosion Control
To the extent practicable, all development shall conform to the natural contours of the land and natural and pre-existing man-made drainage ways shall remain undisturbed. Lot boundaries shall be made to coincide with natural and pre-existing man-made drainage ways within subdivisions to avoid the creation of lots that can be built upon only by altering such drainage ways and topography.
5-19-1 Storm Water Management
All developments shall be constructed and maintained so that adjacent properties are not unreasonably burdened with surface waters as a result of such developments. Specific requirements area:
1. No developments may be constructed or maintained so that such development unreasonably impedes the natural flow of water from higher adjacent properties across such development, thereby unreasonably causing substantial damage to such higher adjacent properties; and
2. No development may be constructed or maintained so that surface waters from such development are unreasonably collected and channeled onto lower adjacent properties at such locations or at such volumes as to cause substantial damage to such lower adjacent properties.
5-19-2 Drainage
A. All developments shall be provided with a drainage system that is adequate to prevent the undue retention of surface water on the development site. Surface waters shall not be regarded as unduly retained if:
1. The retention results from a technique, practice or device deliberately installed as part of an approved sedimentation or storm water runoff control plan; or
2. The retention is not substantially different in location or degree than that experienced by the development site in its predevelopment stage, unless such retention presents a danger to health or safety.
B. No surface water may be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer system.
C. Whenever practicable, the drainage system of a development shall coordinate with and connect to the drainage systems or drainage ways on surrounding properties or streets.
D. Use of drainage swales rather than curb and gutter storm sewers in subdivisions is provided for in Subdivision Regulations of the City of Madison, Alabama. Private roads and access ways within unsubdivided developments shall utilize curb and gutter storm drains to provide adequate drainage if the grade of such roads or access ways is too steep to provide drainage in another manner or if other sufficient reasons exist to require such construction.
E. Construction specifications for drainage swales, curbs and gutters, and storm drains shall be contained in the Subdivision Regulations.
F. The City Engineer may require the detention or retention of stormwater on-site if necessary to meet Stormwater Management level of service standards adopted by the City. However, if capacity is available in the downstream drainage channels, the City Engineer may permit the drainage of the site into the existing system. In the event the site is drained into the existing system, the City Engineer may require the upgrading of downstream drainage improvements if necessary to maintain their

128
predevelopment level of service. Attention is called to the Stormwater Management and Drainage standards and criteria found in the Public Improvements Manual.
5-19-3 Erosion and Sedimentation Control
A. No zoning, special-use, or conditional-use permit may be issued and final approval for subdivision plats or certified plats may not be given with respect to any development that would cause land disturbing activity unless the professional engineer officially representing the developer certifies to the City that all necessary permits have been received from those agencies from which approval is required by state or federal law and that either:
1. An erosion control plan has been submitted to and approved by the City Engineer; or
2. The City Engineer has examined the preliminary plans for the development and it reasonably appears that an erosion control plan can be approved upon submission by the developer of more detailed construction or design drawings. However, in this case, construction of the development may not begin, and no building permits may be issued, until the City Engineer approves the erosion control plan.
B. For the purposes of this section, land disturbing activity means any use of the land by any person in residential, educational, institutional, commercial, or industrial
development, and highway and road construction and maintenance that results in a change in the natural cover or topography and that may cause or contribute to sedimentation. Sedimentation occurs whenever solid mineral or organic particulate matter is transported by water, ice, air, or gravity from the site of its origin.

h. When two identical, flat sign faces are placed back-to-back or at angles of 60 degrees or less, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any one point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 24 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. If the two faces are unequal, the sign area shall be calculated based on the larger of the two faces.
i. The calculation of the width or lineal measurement of any façade shall be the measurement of the façade between two side facades. The calculation shall be based on viewing the façade from a 90-degree angle (i.e., straight on), regardless of façade insets, offsets, or angles. See Figure E.

This official shall have the right to enter upon any premises at any reasonable time prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the purpose of making inspections of buildings or premises necessary in carrying out his duties in the enforcement of this Ordinance.
If the Administrative Officer shall find that any of the provisions of this Ordinance are being violated, he shall take any action authorized to insure compliance with or to prevent violation of its provisions.
Section 9-2. Building Permits Required
It shall be unlawful to commence the excavation for the construction of any building or other structure, including accessory structures or to store building materials or erect temporary field offices, or to commence the moving, alteration, or repair (except repairs not changing the character of the structure and not involving Southern Standard Building Code inspection) of any structure without a building permit issued by the Administrative Officer. Applications for a building permit shall be made to the Administrative Officer on forms provided for that purpose and shall be accompanied by a fee according to a fee schedule currently in use by the City, and a site plan in conformance with Section 9-3 of this Ordinance.
Section 9-3. Approval of Plans and Issuance of Building Permit
It shall be unlawful for the Administrative Officer to approve any plans or issue a building permit for any excavation or construction until he has inspected such plans in detail and found them in conformity with this Ordinance. To this end, the Administrative Officer shall require that every application for a building permit for excavation, construction, use of land, moving, or alteration be accompanied by a plan or plat drawn to scale and showing the following in sufficient detail to enable the Administrative Officer to ascertain whether or not the proposed excavation, construction, use of land, moving or alteration is in conformance with this Ordinance:
1. The actual shape, proportion, and dimensions of the lot to be built upon;
2. The shape, size, and locations of all buildings or other structures to be erected, altered, or moved, and of any buildings or other structures already on the lot;
3. The existing and intended use of all such buildings or other structures;
4. The location and number of required off-street parking and off-street loading spaces;
5. The proposed number of dwelling units; occupants, employees, or other similar uses;
6. The setbacks, side yards, open spaces, required buffers, signs and other requirements of the applicable zoning district;
7. Any other information deemed necessary by the Administrative Officer to determine and provide for the enforcement of this Ordinance.
If the proposed excavation, construction, moving or alteration as set forth in the application is in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance, the Administrative Officer shall issue a building permit accordingly. If an application for a building permit is not approved, the Administrative Officer shall state in writing on the application the cause for such disapproval. Issuance of a building permit shall, in no

case, be construed as waiving any provision of this Ordinance, unless otherwise waived according to Article X, Section 10-9.
Section 9-4. Inspection
The construction or usage affected by any building permit shall be subject to four inspections: the first, when the foundation has been excavated; the second, when the foundation has been completed and the building lines have been established; the third, when all electrical and mechanical elements are in place; and the fourth, when the building or structure has been completed.
It shall be the duty of the holder of the permit to properly notify the Administrative Officer as to the time when the construction will be ready for inspection. Failure to make proper notification of the time for such inspection shall automatically cancel the permit, requiring the issuance of a new permit before construction may proceed or occupancy may be permitted. The proper location of buildings and the verification of setback lines are the responsibility of the owner and not the Administrative Officer. Improper location of buildings is a violation of this Ordinance and may result in the revocation of the Building Permit and/or the Certificate of Occupancy.
Section 9-5. Certificate of Occupancy
9-5-1: No land or building or other structure or part thereof hereafter erected, moved, or altered in its use shall be used or occupied until the Administrative Officer shall have issued a Certificate of Occupancy stating that such land or structure, or part thereof, is found to be in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
9-5-2 Temporary Certificate of Occupancy: When the Administrative Officer shall determine that some detail of this Ordinance has not been complied with, the Administrative Officer shall have the discretionary authority to issue a temporary, time-limited Certificate of Occupancy. Such Temporary Certificate of Occupancy may be issued if all of the following conditions are met:
1. Some special situation exists where, in the opinion of the Administrative Officer, it is not in the public interest to require strict compliance with this Ordinance.
2. A building inspector shall perform a final inspection of the structure, and shall certify that there are no violations of the adopted Building, Gas, Mechanical, Plumbing, Electrical or Fire Safety Codes that might render the structure unsafe in any way.
3. A Subcontractors List has been submitted to and approved by the Inspection Division in the Department of Community Development, according to the Division's rules for the approval thereof.
4. The Certificate is limited to a certain period of time not to exceed 180 days, but not longer than the special situation that gives rise to the need for a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy shall continue (e.g., special event). Such Temporary Certificate of Occupancy shall not be renewed beyond 180 days.
5. All required fees have been paid to the City in connection with the structure.
The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison
Updated July 2019

6. Temporary Certificates of Occupancy may be issued only to single family homes with temporary uses other than "single family dwelling". In all cases, the temporary permitted use shall be shown on the Temporary Certificate of Occupancy, and the Certificate shall be valid only for that use.
9-5-3 Issuance of Temporary Certificates of Occupancy: Issuance of a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy shall be within the discretion of the Administrative Officer, with all decisions on the Issuance or denial of such Certificates reviewable by the Director of Community Development and the Mayor. Appeal of the administrative decision shall be to the Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals. A Temporary Certificate of Occupancy shall be canceled with twenty four (24) hours notice to the property owner if the Administrative Officer shall determine that one or more of the conditions in subsection 9-5-2 is no longer being met. (Ord. 90-14)
9-5-4: Within three (3) days after the owner, or his agent, has notified the Administrative Officer that a building or premises, or part thereof, is ready for occupancy or use, it shall be the duty of the Administrative Officer to make a final inspection thereof, and to issue a Certificate of Occupancy if the building and premises are found to conform with the provisions of this Ordinance; or, if such certificate is refused, to state the refusal in writing with the cause.

Section 10-3. Appeals from the Decision of the Administrative Officer

Section 10-4. Special Exceptions
Special Exceptions are those uses that may have some special impact which differs from the potential impacts of permitted uses or exceeds them in intensity, or have a uniqueness such that their effect on the surrounding environment cannot be determined in advance of the use being proposed in a particular location.
Upon submission of a request for special exception approval, a review of the location, proposed or existing design, configuration, and impact shall be conducted by the Planning Department to determine whether the proposed use would have a detrimental impact on neighboring properties and/or how those impacts may best be mitigated through specific requirements the Board of Adjustment may impose.
The review considers the proposal in terms of existing zoning and land use in the vicinity of the use; planned and proposed public and private developments that may be adversely affected by the proposed use; whether and to what extent the use at the particular location for which it is proposed is consistent with the intent of the Zoning Ordinance and any other development plans, policies and/or regulations of the City of Madison; and whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken by the
The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison
Updated July 2019
176
developer to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed use on the immediate vicinity and on the public health, safety, and welfare in general.
10-4-1 Applicability of Special Exceptions
Any use designated as a Special Exception in any district as enumerated in this Ordinance shall comply with Section 10-4.
10-4-2 Procedures for Application for Special Exception
All applications for a special exception shall be submitted and approved prior to application for a Zoning Compliance Permit. A subdivision plat or a site plan meeting the requirements of this Ordinance and all other development regulations of the City of Madison shall be included in applications for Special Exceptions in all zoning districts. Site plan or subdivision approval shall not be granted prior to or contingent upon Special Exception approval.
A Special Exception shall be processed by the Planning Department and granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment only in accordance with the following:
1. Application and fee (See Chapter 16-2 Madison Code of Ordinances)( for a Special Exception must be submitted to the Planning Department thirty (30) days prior to the public hearing as required in Section 10-2-3, Public Hearings. Copies of the application will be distributed by the Planning Department to the Technical Review Committee members for review comments.
2. All Special Exception applications shall be made to the Board in writing on applications provided by the Planning Department. If the applicant is an agent for the property owner, a notarized letter from the property owner authorizing the agent to make application and represent the property owner before the Board of Adjustment must accompany the application.
3. The applicant shall submit with each application a notarized list of names and addresses of all adjoining property owners as recorded in the appropriate countys Office of Probate. Using the applicant-provided list, the City will mail a public hearing notice letter no later than ten (10) days prior to the public hearing. The letter will include the following information:
a. Legal description of the property and the street address or approximate location in the City of Madison;
b. Present zoning classification of the property and the nature of the Special Exception requested; and
c. Date, time, and place of hearing.
4. The applicant shall submit a site plan and/or subdivision plan meeting all City of Madison requirements for such and demonstrating the Special Exception Permit is in compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance and especially those listed in Section 10-4-3.
5. The Planning Department will review the location, the application and all other portions of the application and produce a report (including an analysis of the proposal and recommendations) regarding the findings and any conditions which should be considered by the Board of Adjustment as conditions.
6.

Said notice shall be published no less than five (5) days before the meeting of the Board.
The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison
Updated July 2019
177
10-4-3 Standards of Review for a Special Exception
No application for a Special Exception shall be approved unless the Board of Adjustment shall specifically find the proposed use appropriate in the location for which it is proposed. This finding shall be based on the following criteria:
1. The proposed use shall be in harmony with the general purpose, goals, objectives, and standards of this Ordinance, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted, or under consideration pursuant to official notice, by the City.
2. The proposed use at the proposed location shall not result in a substantial or undue adverse effect on adjacent property, the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, parking, public improvements, public sites or rights-of-way, or other matters affecting the public health, safety, and general welfare either as they now exist or as they may in the future be developed as a result of the implementation of provisions and policies of this Ordinance, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted, or under consideration pursuant to official notice, by the City or other governmental agency having jurisdiction to guide growth and development.
3. The proposed use will be adequately served by, and will not impose an undue burden on, any of the improvements, facilities, utilities, and services specified in this subsection. Where any such improvements, facilities, utilities, or services are not available or adequate to service the proposed use in the proposed location, the applicant shall, as part of the application and as a condition to approval of the proposed Special Exception permit, be responsible for establishing ability, willingness, and commitment to provide such improvements, facilities, utilities, and services in sufficient time and in a manner consistent with this Ordinance, and other plans, programs, maps, and ordinances adopted by the City to guide its growth and development. The approval of the Special Exception Permit shall be conditioned upon such improvements, facilities, utilities, and services being provided and guaranteed by the applicant.
4. The Board of Adjustment may attach recommendations for Special Exception approval, additional criteria dealing with buffer yards, parking, lighting, building materials, signage or any other aspect of site plan approval necessary to mitigate the impact of the proposed Special Exception on the surrounding property. All conditions imposed upon any Special Exception permit approval, except those which are otherwise stated in this Ordinance, shall be expressly set forth in the order granting such Special Exception permits. Unless and until prescribed conditions are met, no Zoning Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy, or Business License shall be granted for the applicant for the Special Exception at the property.
5. The application shall be denied if the Zoning Board of Adjustment finds that the application and record fail to establish compliance with the standards of this Ordinance. Further, the application shall be denied if the adverse impacts of the development, despite any mitigating conditions that might be imposed by the Board of Adjustments, outweigh any public or private benefits of the proposal and require denial in the interest of the overall public health, safety, and welfare.
10-4-4 Approval or Denial of a Special Exception
1. In granting any Special Exception, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall issue a Special Exception Permit and prescribe the appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the Special Exception is granted, shall be deemed violation of this Ordinance and punishable under the penalty sections of this Ordinance.
2. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall prescribe a time limit within which the action for which the Special Exception is required shall be begun or completed, or both. Failure to begin or complete the action within the time limit set shall void the Special Exception.
The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison
Updated July 2019
178
3. In the event a permit for a Special Exception is approved subject to conditions, the applicant shall submit a revised site plan meeting all conditions of approval. Only once approval is granted and/or all conditions are met will the Planning Department process the application on the Zoning Compliance for the use and/or development to which the Special Exception Permit applies. Any Zoning Compliance issued for a Special Exception shall have attached the signed order from the Board of Adjustment for the same.
4. For any Special Exception approved, all permit requirements must be approved and a Certificate of Occupancy issued within twelve (12) months after Board action. The Zoning Board of Adjustment, upon recommendation by the Technical Review Committee, may make an extension of said permit approval for a single period of up to six (6) months from the date when that permit would otherwise expire. An extension may be granted only if the Board of Adjustments concludes that the applicant or developer has proceeded with due diligence and in good faith and that conditions have not changed substantially so as to warrant a new application. All such requests for extensions must be submitted in writing not less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the permit stating the reason for the time extension request. Requests for extensions in excess of six (6) months shall not be granted. Instead, the applicant shall submit a new application for review according to the requirements of this section.
5. If the Special Exception Use is discontinued for more than twelve (12) months, then the Special Exception shall be deemed expired.
Section 10-5. Variances
10-5-1 Purpose for Variances
It is expected that the granting of variances, an empowerment of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, will be rare; however, a variance may be appropriate where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape or by reason of other exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situations or conditions attributable to a piece of property, the strict application of any regulation enacted under this Ordinance would result in peculiar, exceptional, and undue hardship on the owner of such property. Those developments requiring a variance from any regulation of this Ordinance in conjunction with site plan review shall have the appropriate request acted upon by the Zoning Board of Adjustment. This shall include existing development sites proposed for expansion or reconfiguration and which are nonconforming to any requirement of this Ordinance. The site plan may be reviewed concurrently and approved conditionally with review and action on the variance request, but the site plan shall not be approved for development until the variance has been approved.
10-5-2 Procedures for Application for Variances
A Variance shall be processed by the Planning Department and granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment only in accordance with the following:
1. Application and fee (See Chapter 16-2, Madison Code of Ordinances) for a Variance must be submitted to the Planning Department thirty (30) days prior to the public hearing as required in Section 10-2-3, Public Hearings. Copies of the application will be distributed by the Planning Department to the Technical Review Committee members for review comments.
2. All Variance applications shall be made to the Board in writing indicating the Section of this Ordinance under which the variance is sought, and stating the grounds upon which it is requested. The applicant must state the exact relief being sought from the application of specific regulation. Said submittal must be done on an application provided by the Planning Department. If the applicant is an agent for the property owner, the application must be
The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison
Updated July 2019
179
accompanied by a notarized letter from the property owner authorizing the agent to make application and represent the property owner before the Board of Adjustment.
3. The applicant shall submit with each application a notarized list of names and addresses of all adjoining property owners as recorded in the County Office of Probate. The City is responsible for mailing a public hearing notice letter no later than ten (10) days prior to the public hearing. The letter shall include the following information:
a. Legal description of the property and the street address or approximate location in the City of Madison;
b. Present zoning classification of the property and the nature of the Variance requested;
c. Date, time, and place of hearing.
4. The applicant shall submit a site plan and/or subdivision plan meeting all City of Madison requirements for such and demonstrating the Variance is in compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
5. Upon receipt of said completed written application, fee, and list, a notice of public hearing before the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall be given by notice on the City of Madison Website or other proper notification method. Said notice shall be published no less than five (5) days before the meeting of the Board.
10-5-3 Standards of Review for Variances
The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall grant no variance in the strict application of the provision of this Ordinance unless it finds that the following requirements and standards are satisfied. In general, the power to authorize a variance from the terms of this Ordinance shall be sparingly exercised. It is the intent of this Ordinance that the variance be used only to overcome some exceptional physical condition of a parcel of land which poses practical difficulty to its development and prevents its owner from using the property as intended by the Zoning Ordinance. Any variance granted shall be the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land.
The applicant must prove that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and that practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship will result if it is not granted. In particular, the applicant shall establish and substantiate that the appeal for the variance conforms to all of the requirements and standards listed below:
1. The granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the regulations imposed by this Ordinance on the district in which it is located and shall not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
2. The granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of any use which is not permitted in the district.
3. There must be proof of unique circumstances or conditions fully described in the findings and applicable to the land or buildings for which the variance is sought, such circumstances or conditions being peculiar to such land or buildings and generally having no application to land or buildings in the district, and which circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building.
4. There must be proof of unnecessary hardship. It is not sufficient proof of hardship to show that greater profit would result if the variance were granted. Furthermore, the hardship complained of cannot be self-created nor can it be established on this basis by one who purchases with or without knowledge of the restrictions. It must result from the application of this Ordinance; it must be suffered directly by the property in question; and evidence of other variances or non-conformities granted under similar circumstances shall not be considered.
The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison
Updated July 2019
180
5. That the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building and that the variance as requested from the Zoning Board of Adjustment is the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose.
6. That the proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the adjacent neighborhood.
7. That the granting of the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
The Board may prescribe any safeguard that it deems necessary to secure substantially the objectives of the regulations or provisions to which the variance applies.
Section 10-6. Zoning Compliance
10-6-1 Applicability
No use, improvement, and/or development of property permitted by this Ordinance, including accessory and temporary uses, may be established and no existing building may be altered with respect to its use after [enter the effective date of this Ordinance] until a Zoning Compliance Certificate has been issued by the Planning Department.
Nothing herein shall relieve any applicant of the additional responsibility of seeking any permit required by any applicable statute, ordinance, or regulations in compliance with all of the terms of this Ordinance.
Conditions for permits to raze or remove buildings are set by other ordinances. The violation of any condition contained in an approval of or in reliance upon in the issuance of the Zoning Compliance Certificate shall be a violation of this Ordinance.
10-6-2 Application Requirements for Zoning Compliance Certificate
All applications for Zoning Compliance Certificates shall be made in writing by the owner or developer of the property for which it is sought. The application provided by the Planning Department shall be filed with the Planning Department and include the following:
1. Name of the business;
2. Applicant name and contact information;
3. Legal and full property address for which the certificate is sought;
4. Special Exception Permit, if required, and the signed order attached to the application; and
5. Request for site plan review, if required (e.g., required for conversion from residential use to commercial use).
When a zoning certificate is sought for a development that is a part of a plat or subdivision which has received final plat approval or which has been issued a Special Exception Permit, the plat or conditional use permit, together with any covenants, conditions, or other restrictions related thereto, shall be reviewed as a part of the application for the Zoning Compliance Certificate. Application for a Special Exception Permit or Site Plan Approval, where required, shall be made and approval granted by the appropriate body prior to application or issuance of a Zoning Compliance Certificate.
The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison
Updated July 2019
181
In the case of any development located within a subdivision, the subdivision shall have received final plat approval and been recorded before the Planning Director will accept an application for a Zoning Compliance Certificate. If the development for which a zoning certificate is sought is required by this Ordinance to undergo site plan review, the approved site plan shall be made a part of the application for a zoning certificate and shall suffice as the statement of proposed use required by this Section.
A temporary use and an accessory use shall require a zoning certificate as a precondition to their lawful establishment. The Planning Director may establish regulations governing the application requirements for a zoning certificate in the case of either a temporary or accessory use that is established at any time other than simultaneously with a principal use, in which case all information specified in this Section shall be submitted. The purpose of the required information is to provide the Planning Director with a sufficient factual basis to determine whether all requirements of this Ordinance applicable to temporary and accessory uses have been met.
10-6-3 Procedures for Issuance of a Zoning Compliance Certificate
All proposed uses, alterations, conversions, or developments for which a Zoning Compliance Certificate is required shall be reviewed for compliance with this Ordinance. Within ten (10) calendar days after the complete application for a zoning certificate has been accepted, the Planning Department shall inform the applicant whether the application has been granted.
1. In any case where the application is granted, the Planning Director shall issue a Zoning Compliance Certificate which shall state: This certificate does not signify building codes review or approval or subdivision review or approval and is not authorization to undertake any work without such review and approval where either is required. Before any structure to which this certificate is applicable may be occupied or used for any purpose, a certificate of occupancy must be obtained.
2. In any case where an application is denied, the Planning Director shall state the specific reasons and shall cite the specific chapters, articles, and sections of this Ordinance upon which denial is based. If relief of such denial would be available by special permit or variance, the Planning Director shall so state and shall refer the applicant to the appropriate sections of this Ordinance.
10-6-4 Penalties
Any person who fails to obtain a Zoning Compliance Certificate prior to applying for a business license, building permit, certificate of occupancy or prior beginning construction, use or erecting a sign shall be subject to doubling of all applicable fees of the process. Furthermore, the Planning Department will notify all other approving departments and agencies of the violation of zoning compliance.

ARTICLE V
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
Section 5-l. Minimum Standards
The following planning and design standards shall be complied with, and no higher
standard may be required by the Planning Commission, except where because of
exceptional and unique conditions of topography, location, shape, size, drainage, or
other physical features of the site, minimum standards specified herein would not
reasonably protect or provide for public health, safety, or welfare. Any higher standard
required shall be reasonable and shall be limited to the minimum additional
improvements necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare. In addition to
the requirements established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with the following
laws, rules, and regulations:
(a) All applicable statutory provisions.
(b) The City of Madison Zoning Ordinance, building and housing ordinances,
and all other applicable laws of the appropriate jurisdiction.
(c) The Comprehensive Plan of the City of Madison including the
Transportation Plan and Land Use Plan.
(d) The special requirements and rules of the Madison County Health
Department and/or appropriate state agencies.
(e) The rules and standards of the State Highway Department if the
subdivision or any lot contained herein abuts a state highway.
(f) The standards and regulations adopted by all boards, commissions,
agencies, and officials of the City of Madison, including the Citys
adopted Public Improvements Construction Manual.
(g) Plat approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not in conformity with
the above guides or policy and purpose of these regulations established
in Section 1-1 of these regulations.
Section 5-2. General Requirements
5-2-l Plats straddling Municipal Boundaries. Whenever access to the subdivision is
required across land in another local government, the Planning Commission may
request assurance from the City Attorney that access is legally established, and from the
City Engineer that the access road is adequately improved, or that an improvement
guarantee has been duly executed and is sufficient in amount to assure the
construction of the access road. In general, lot lines should be laid out so as not to
cross municipal boundary lines.
5-2-2 Character of the Land. Land which the Planning Commission finds to be
unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep
35
slopes, rock formations, adverse soil formations or topography, utility easements, or
other features which will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general
welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding
areas, shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated
by the applicant and approved by the Planning Commission, upon recommendation of the
City Engineer, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions.
Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve such a danger.
Land within the Floodway District shall not be platted for residential occupancy or
building sites. Land outside the floodway but subject to flood may be platted for
residential occupancy provided each lot contains a building site that may reasonably
lend itself to construction of a floor level above flood elevation, or for such other
uses which will not increase the danger to health, life, and property. Fill may not be
used to raise land in the floodway. In other areas subject to flood, fill may be used
providing the proposed fill does not restrict the flow of water and unduly increase flood
heights.
5-2-3 Subdivision Name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate,
or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the
area covered by these regulations. The Planning Commission shall have final
authority to designate the name of the subdivision which shall be determined at
Preliminary Plat approval.
5-2-4 Population Densities. The population densities established by the Zoning
Ordinance of the City of Madison shall be observed.
5-2-5 Waterbodies and Watercourses. If a tract being subdivided contains a water
body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute the entire
ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots. The Planning
Commission may approve an alternative plan whereby the ownership of and
responsibility for, safe maintenance of the water body is so placed that it will not
become a City responsibility. No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the
minimum area of a lot required under the Zoning Ordinance may be satisfied by land
which is under water. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from
the street by which it has access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert
or other structure of design approved by the City Engineer.
Section 5-3. Street Plan
The arrangement, character, extent, location, and grade of all streets shall be laid out
according to good land planning principles and shall be integrated with all existing and
planned streets. New streets shall consider topographical conditions, orientation to
vistas, public convenience and safety, and the proposed uses of land to be served by
them.
5-3-1(a) Continuation of Adjoining Street System. Proposed new streets shall extend
existing streets or their projections at the same or greater width, but in no case
less than the minimum required width, unless variations are deemed necessary by
the Planning Commission for reasons of topography or design.. This policy shall
not apply to stub streets that provide frontage to no more than four lots.
36
5-3-1(b) The creation of street intersections of three or more streets converging
together shall not be permitted.
5-3-1(c) All lots for sale to the public shall front on a paved public street meeting the
minimum improvement requirements of these Regulations.
5-3-2 Access to Adjacent Properties. Property abutting a proposed subdivision shall
not be left landlocked by such proposed subdivision. When the Planning Commission
staff determines that it is desirable to provide for street access to an adjoining property,
the staff shall perform an evaluation pursuant to Ordinance No. 94-110. The staff of the
Planning Commission shall submit to the Planning Commission a written report of its
findings and conclusions. Such report shall summarize the staffs findings for each step
of the evaluation as described in Section 5 of Ordinance 94-110, as may from time to
time be amended. The report shall also state any specific interests or concerns identified
by the staff that may be impacted by the proposed subdivision (as described in Section 6
of Ordinance 94-110, as may from time to time be amended), as well as any existing
facilities considered in the staff evaluation. If the Planning Commission staff determines
that it is recommended and justifiable, then The Planning Commission may require
proposed streets to be extended by dedication and paved to the boundary of such property
and a turnaround be provided, as a condition of approval of the preliminary and/or Final
Plat of said subdivision.
5-3-3 Marginal Access Streets. Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission,
development which abuts, or has included within the proposed area, any arterial or
major thoroughfare as shown on the Land Use Plan, may require a marginal access
street or other treatment which may be necessary to provide for the adequate
protection of properties, and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
5-3-4 Private Streets. There shall be no private streets platted in a subdivision where
abutting properties will be sold, whether immediately or in the future, to the public.
5-3-5 Private Reserve Strips. Private reserve strips (including spite strips)
controlling access to streets shall be prohibited.
5-3-6 Additional Width on Existing Roads. If the subdivision adjoins existing streets
that do not meet the minimum street width requirements, the Planning Commission staff
may perform an evaluation pursuant to Ordinance No. 94-110. The staff of the Planning
Commission shall submit to the Planning Commission a written report of its findings and
conclusions. Such report shall summarize the staffs findings for each step of the
evaluation as described in Section 5 of Ordinance 94-110, as may from time to time be
amended. The report shall also state any specific interests or concerns identified by the
staff that may be impacted by the proposed subdivision (as described in Section 6 of
Ordinance 94-110, as may from time to time be amended), as well as any existing
facilities considered in the staff evaluation. If the Planning Commission staff determines
that it is recommended and justifiable, then the Planning Commission may require the
dedication of additional right-of-way to meet the minimum street width requirements, as
a condition of approval of the preliminary or Final Plat of said subdivision.
5-3-7 Street Names. Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with others
existing and named, shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case
37
shall the name of proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing
street names, irrespective of the use of the suffix, street, avenue, boulevard, drive,
place, court, etc. Street names are subject to the approval of the Planning Commission.
5-3-8 Vacating a Street or Easement. No street or easement may be vacated unless
such action is submitted to, and approved by, the Governing Body. The Governing
Body may request a study and recommendation by the Planning Commission before
taking such action.
5-3-9 Frontage on Improved Roads.
1) No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided shall have
frontage on, and access from, an existing public street, including, but not
limited to the following:
a) An existing federal, state or county highway, or
b) A street shown upon a plat approved by the Planning Commission and of legal
recorded in the Office of the County Probate Judge. Such street or highway
must be suitably improved as required by the rules, regulations, specifications,
or orders, OR be secured by an improvement guarantee required under these
subdivision regulations, with the width and rights-of-way meeting or
exceeding the minimum requirements of these subdivision regulations.
2) Within a General Business District permitted uses and special exceptions shall be
located only on frontage roads to arterials and major thoroughfares as depicted on the
Citys Land Use Plan or have access through areas not zoned for residential or
agricultural purposes.
3) Subdivisions which have, or are planned to have at least 51 lots are required to
provide at least two accesses.
5-3-10 Grading and Improvement Plan. Roads shall be graded and improved and
conform to the City of Madison construction standards and specifications and shall be
approved as to design and specifications by the City Engineer and Planning
Commission in accordance with the construction plans required to be submitted prior
to Final Plat approval.
5-3-11 Topography and Arrangement
(1) Roads shall be related appropriately to the topography. Minor streets shall
be curved wherever possible to avoid conformity of lot appearance. All streets
shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building sites at, or
above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible
to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and curves shall be
38
avoided. Specific standards are contained in the Design Standards (Section 5-4) of
these regulations.
(2) All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed
system of thoroughfares as established in the Comprehensive Plan.
(3) All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic generators such as
industries, business districts, schools, churches, and shopping centers; to
population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses.
(4) Minor streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to the
topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and
utility systems, and to require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide
convenient and safe access to property.
Section 5-4. Design Standards
The following design standards shall be considered minimum requirements and
shall specifically apply to residential subdivisions. The requirements for nonresidential
subdivisions shall be such as the Planning Commission deems appropriate
for the type of development and use contemplated but in no event be less than the
requirements of residential subdivisions.
5-4-1 Right-of-Way Widths. Minimum street right-of-way widths shall be not less
than the following:
(1) Major Street 60 feet
(2) Minor Street 50 feet

5-4-7 Intersections. Street intersections shall be laid out as follows:
(1) Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles.
A proposed intersection of two (2) new streets at an angle of less than
seventy-five (75) degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should
be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at
right angles for at least one hundred (100) feet therefrom. Not more than two
(2) streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by
the Planning Commission.
(2) Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever
practical, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such
street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be

provided having not greater than a five percent (5%) grade at a distance of
fifty (50) feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting
street.
(5) Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation
inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility,
the applicant shall cut such ground and/or vegetation (including trees) in
connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed
necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
(6) The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be five percent
(5%) or less.
(7) Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a minimum radius of
twenty (20) feet.
41
5-4-8 Perimeter Streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out
so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an existing halfstreet
is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be
improved and dedicated by the applicant. The Planning Commission may authorize
a new perimeter street where the applicant improves and dedicates the entire required
street right-of-way width within his own subdivision boundaries.
5-4-9 Access to Major Roads. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an
existing or proposed road depicted in the Major Street Plan in the Comprehensive Plan,
the Planning Commission shall require that access to such streets be limited by one of
the following means: (Ord. 96-6)
(1) The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the arterial and front onto a parallel

be provided in a strip of land along the rear property line of such lots.
(2) A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and
designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of
their terminal lots backing onto the arterial.
(3) A marginal access or service road (separated from the arterial by a planting or
grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points).
5-4-10 Road Names. The Sketch Plat as submitted shall not indicate any names
upon proposed streets. The Planning Commission shall approve all roads at the time
of preliminary approval. Names shall be sufficiently different in sound and in
spelling from other road names in the City of Madison so as not to cause confusion. A
road which is or is planned as a continuation of an existing road shall bear the same
name.
5-4-11 Excess Right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designated in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes shall not be
in excess of two to one.
5-4-12 Railroads, Arterials, and Major Thoroughfares. Railroad rights-of-way,
arterials, and major thoroughfares where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands shall be treated as follows:
(1) In residential districts, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in addition to the
normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be provided adjacent to
the railroad right-of-way, arterial, or major thoroughfare. This strip shall be
part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat: This strip is
reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon is prohibited.
(2) In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses, the nearest
street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall,
wherever practical, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable
depth for commercial or industrial sites.
42
(3) Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which crosses the
railroad at a grade shall, to the extent practical, be at a distance of at least
150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined
with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation
of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
5-4-13 Cul-de-sacs. Permanent deadend streets shall not exceed eight hundred (800)
feet in length, and shall be provided with a turnaround having a roadway
diameter of at least eighty (80) feet and a right-of-way diameter of at least one
hundred (100) feet. Cul-de-sac length is measured from the intersection of the
centerline of the cul-de-sac with the centerline of another street which is itself not
a cul-de-sac, to the center of the bulb. Cul-de-sacs shall not be used to avoid
connection with an existing street or to avoid the extension of an important street.
However, cul-de-sac lengths of up to 1600 ft. may be permitted, provided that an
emergency access easement is provided between a point within 200 ft. and the end
of the cul-de-sac and an existing, unused stub street.
5-4-14 Temporary deadend streets shall be provided with a paved turnaround having a
forty (40) foot radius.
5-4-15 Stub Streets.
(a) The Planning Commission may require the connection to existing stub streets, and
the creation of new stub streets, where it is found to be in the interest of traffic
circulation, safety concerns, and the minimization of arterial traffic congestion.
(b) All stub streets created within the subdivision shall have a 32 sq. ft. sign placed at the
end of the street reading Temporary Dead  End. This street may be continued onto
adjacent property in the future. This sign will be fabricated and erected by the Citys
Public Works Department.
5-4-16 Emergency Access easements. Emergency Access easements are easements that
provide emergency access between subdivisions.
(a) Emergency Access easements may be required by the Planning
Commission
(b) Emergency Access easements shall be at least 30 ft. in width and
centered on a property line.
(c) Underground utilities may be placed in an emergency access easement.

approval by the City Engineer, EMA Director, and Fire Chief.
(e) Emergency Access easements must be improved to carry the weight of
emergency vehicles under all weather conditions.
43
(f) No landscaping, fences, or other structures of any description, other
than grass, may be placed in an emergency access easement. The
design of improvements within an emergency access easement is
subject to approval of the City of Madison EMA Director, Fire Chief,
and the Planning Commission.
(g) The restrictions enumerated in Sec. 5-4-16(f) shall be recorded on the
plat.
(h) Emergency Access easements shall be permanently marked with easily
visible monuments pursuant to rules adopted by the City of Madison
EMA Director and Fire Chief.
(i) Curbs bounding Emergency Access Easements shall be constructed to
facilitate their use by emergency vehicles. Such curbs shall be subject
to approval by the City of Madison EMA Director and Fire Chief.
(j) Emergency Access easements shall not exceed 350 ft. in length
(k) Emergency Access easements may include sidewalks and/or vehicular
barriers, at the discretion of the Planning Commission. Design and
construction of any barriers shall be subject to approval by the City
Engineer, EMA Director, and Fire Chief.
Section 5-5. Blocks
a. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of lots of
appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to arterials, major thoroughfares, railroads, or
waterways.
b. The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are appropriate
for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but block
lengths in residential areas shall not exceed two thousand two hundred
(2,200) feet or twelve (12) times the minimum lot width required in the
zoning district (whichever is less), nor be less than four hundred (400) feet in
length. Wherever practical, blocks along arterials, major thoroughfares, and
collector streets shall be not less than eight hundred (800) feet in length.
c. In long blocks, the Planning Commission may require the reservation of an
easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or
pedestrian traffic.
Pedestrianways or crosswalks, not less than ten (10) feet wide, may be required by
the Planning Commission through the center of blocks more than eight hundred
(800) feet along where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or other community facilities. Blocks
designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and width as may be determined
suitable by the Planning Commission for prospective use.
44
Section 5-6. Lots.
Residential lots shall comply with the following requirements:
a. Lot dimensions shall be not less than the requirements of the zoning district
in which they are located and the requirements of the County Health
Department. In cases where requirements conflict, the greater requirement
shall govern.
b. Each lot shall front upon a dedicated street having not less than a fifty (50) foot
right-of-way.
c. Where land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such
parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future streets and
logical further re-subdivision.
d. Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial and industrial
purposes shall be adequate to provide for off-street parking and loading for the
use contemplated.
e. Double frontage lots shall be avoided, except where essential to provide
separation of residential development from traffic arteries, or to overcome
specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
f. Side lot lines shall be at right angles to streets, except on curves where they
shall be radial.
g. All residential lots shall have an area of at least seven thousand five hundred
(7,500) square feet. Additional lot area is required when:
(1) A lot is served by public water but not public sewer. In such case, said lot
shall be not less than fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet in area.
(2) Public water or sewer is not provided. In such case, said lot shall be not
less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in area.
h. All residential lots shall have a minimum width at the building line of sixty
(60) and a minimum width, at the street line, of thirty-five (35) feet. Corner
lots shall have an extra width of fifteen (15) feet to permit adequate setback
from side streets. The minimum lot depth of single-tier lots shall be one
hundred and twenty-five (125) feet. All other lots shall be a minimum of one
hundred (100) feet in depth. Greater lot width and depth is required when:
(1) A lot is served by public water but not public sewer. In such case, said lot
shall be not less than eighty (80) feet in width and not less than one hundred
and twenty (120) feet in depth.
(2) Public water or sewer is not provided. In such case, said lot shall be not less
than one hundred (100) feet in width and not less than one hundred and
fifty (150) feet in depth.
5-7. Easements
Utility and other easements shall be provided as follows:
45
a. Easements for Utilities. Except where alleys are provided for the
purpose, the Planning Commission may require easements of adequate
width for poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas,
water, and heat mains, or other utility lines on each side of the common
rear lot lines and along side lot lines if necessary or advisable in the
opinion of the Planning Commission.
b. Where a subdivision is traversed by an existing or proposed water
course, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a
storm drainage easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with
the lines of such existing or planned drainageway. The width of such
drainage easement or right-of-way shall be sufficient to contain the
ultimate channel and maintenance way for the tributary area upstream.
c. Where a subdivision discharges or is planned to discharge stormwater in
an amount or concentration that exceeds the lands pre-development
discharge, the City shall require the developer to acquire offsite drainage
rights, in the form of perpetual unobstructed easements with widths
adequate to accommodate the projected basinwide post-development flow.
Such easements must extend continuously to an adequate existing
drainage easement, city right-of-way, or a natural drainageway as depicted
on the United States Geological Survey 30 x 60 Minute Quadrangle Map
(1:100,000 Scale). Any such easement dedication must be approved by
the City Engineer and City Attorney prior to approval of the Preliminary
Plat.
d. Where land inside the Ldn 65+ airport noise zone is proposed to be
subdivided, there may be required the dedication of avigation easements in
such manner as prescribed by the Planning Commission. The Airport
Authority shall be notified by the Commission at least ten days prior to
action on a preliminary or Certified Plat, and will be given the opportunity
to make recommendations on the requirement of avigation easements
within the plat.
Section 5-8. Drainage and Inundation
A drainage plan shall be made for each subdivision by the applicants engineer,
which plan shall take into consideration the ultimate or saturated development of the
tributary area in which the proposed subdivision is located. Adequate provisions shall
be made to provide drainage easements needed within the subdivision, taking into
consideration the saturated development of the tributary area. Calculations shall be
based on the Citys adopted Comprehensive Plan, particularly Volume II (Drainage
Master Plan), as may be modified from time to time.
The storm and sanitary sewer plans shall be worked out prior to the development of
the other utility plans. Engineering considerations shall give preferential treatment to
these gravity flow improvements, as opposed to other utilities and improvements. Offpremise
drainage easements and improvements may be required to handle the runoff
of subdivisions into a natural drainage channel, as specified in Sections 5-7 c and 6-1-
46
9 of these Regulations. But under no condition shall storm drainage be emptied into
the sanitary sewer systemor vice versa.
The developers engineer shall consult the Citys Drainage Master Plan, the Citys
adopted stormwater management regulations, and the Citys Public Improvements
Construction specifications manual for further requirements, and shall abide by them. All
interpretations of the requirements found in these documents shall be made by the City
Engineer.
Low areas subject to periodic inundation shall not be developed or subdivided unless
and until the Planning Commission establishes that:
a. The nature of the land use (i.e., recreational areas) would not lend itself
to damage by water inundation to an appreciable extent;
b. The area may be filled or improved in such a manner to prevent such
periodic inundation; or
c. Minimum floor elevations be required to prevent damage to buildings
and structures, on site or adjacent thereto.
The Planning Commission or City Engineer may require whatever additional
engineering information it deems necessary to make a decision on subdivisions and
other development which contains an area of questionable drainage. Lakes, ponds, and
similar areas will be accepted for maintenance only if sufficient land is dedicated as a
public recreation area, or if such area constitutes a necessary part of the drainage
control system. Such park land will be subject to approval by the City Council.
Section 5-9. Erosion and Washing
(a) Upon completion of curb installation and backfill, a siltscreen must be installed at
back of curb to help prevent erosion and washing mud on street, unless exempted
by the Planning, Engineering and Building Director or his designee. The minimum
height requirement for the siltscreen is twenty-four (24) inches. Installation of
the siltscreen shall be as per manufacturers instructions. All erosion control
measures required by the Citys Construction Specification Manual shall also be
adhered to.
(b) In the event that stormwater runoff is directed toward, or may enter, an opening in the
ground that provides access to the groundwater table (e.g., well, sinkhole, etc.), the
developer shall present a mitigation plan to ensure that no pollutants enter the
groundwater table during construction. Additionally, the developer shall, in concert
with the Water and Wastewater Board of the City of Madison, take steps to ensure
that any such openings are protected from any future surface water infiltration. This
may be accomplished by permanently closing such openings, or by taking other steps
acceptable to the Board.
(c) The erosion, sedimentation, surface water protection and related regulations of the
Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) are hereby
incorporated in this document by reference. Prior to the approval of any Preliminary
47
Plat, the applicant shall demonstrate that they have applied for all required ADEM
permits, and shall present the City with copies of said permits when received. No
subdivision shall be accepted into the Citys maintenance program until a copy of
said permit has been filed with the City along with required As-Built drawings.
48
ARTICLE VI
REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
Section 6-l. Improvements
Approval of the Final Plat shall be subject to the installation of the improvements and
utilities hereinafter designated and satisfactorily completed in accordance with the City
of Madison and Water and Wastewater Board specifications and standards, or the
posting of an improvement guarantee with sufficient surety to secure indemnify the
City for the actual construction and installation of such improvements and utilities.
6-1-1 Street and Alleys. After sewer and water utilities have been installed by the
applicant, the applicant shall construct curbs and gutters and shall surface, or cause
to be surfaced roadways to the widths prescribed in these regulations. All road
pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds, and
sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards and specifications adopted
by the Planning Commission and the City of Madison, and shall be incorporated into
the construction plans required to be submitted for plat approval. (See Appendix II
for Street Sections).
6-1-2 Curbs and Gutters. Standard approved type curbs and gutters shall be
placed on both sides of all new streets within the area of jurisdiction of these
regulations in accordance with the City specifications. Subdivisions where the
minimum lot size is thirty-five thousand (35,000) square feet or more will not be
required to install standard curb and gutter.
6-1-3 Sidewalks. (Reso. 2001-03)
(1) Sidewalks shall be included within the nonpavement right-of-way of all roads
as shown in Schedule I.
(2) Sidewalks shall be improved as required in these regulations. A median strip of
grassed or landscaped area at least two (2) feet wide shall separate all sidewalks from
adjacent curbs. However, in no case shall sidewalks be installed within 16 of the
centerline of any water main or service line installed behind the curb.
(3) In addition to the sidewalks required by Schedule I, five-ft. sidewalks may also be
required by the Planning Commission on any public right-of-way physically adjoining
the subdivision.
(4) In the event that a waiver is granted by the Planning Commission to permit
sidewalks within the subdivision on one side of the street only, a five foot wide sidewalk
will be required.

6-1-4 Pedestrian Accesses
(a) Requirement. Whenever the Planning Commission staff determines that it is
desirable to facilitate pedestrian access from the subdivision roads to schools,
parks, playgrounds, other subdivisions, or other nearby roads, the staff shall
submit to the Planning Commission a written report of its findings and
recommendations with respect to such access opportunities. If the Planning
Commission staff determines that provision of such access is recommended,
or on its own initiative, the Planning Commission may require the dedication
and improvement of pedestrian access public rights-of-way within the
subdivision in locations approved by the Commission. This requirement shall
not apply to existing subdivisions whose preliminary or Final Plats were
approved prior to adoption of this Resolution regulation.
(b) Location: The Planning Commission may require the creation of pedestrian
access public rights-of-way that provide access to adjacent
1) schools,
2) public parks,
3) greenways and trails as depicted in the Comprehensive Plan;
4) neighborhoods,
5) shopping areas,
6) public lands,
7) transportation or other community facilities, or
50
8) vacant parcels, held either publicly or privately, which could
provide future neighborhood connection(s) to the above noted sites,
In addition, pedestrian accesses may be required to connect sites other than
those noted above when there is evidence that a pedestrian would otherwise be
forced to travel alongside a designated collector or arterial roadway, or other
roadway that may be hazardous for pedestrian travel, in order to reach a
destination, where such travel alongside a designated collector or arterial road
may be avoided by construction of a pedestrian access.
(c) Design
While the city may exercise considerable discretion in determining the design
of pedestrian accesses, the following minimum standards should be followed:
1) Unless approved otherwise by the Planning Commission, all pedestrian
accesses shall be paved, and the paved portion of the pedestrian access
may range from 4 to 10 feet in width, depending on the designed use.
Factors to consider may include the length of the path and what the
pathway is connecting to. Generally, pedestrian accesses that anticipate
high use may be wider. Barriers shall be placed at the terminal ends of
paths the design of which are adequate to restrict use by motor vehicles
while allowing use by wheel chairs and other modes of travel.
2) Unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission, five (5) feet of
landscaping, generally divided equally between the two edges with some
width variation to allow meander of pathways shall be required, and the
entire pedestrian access will be entirely within a permanent public rightof-
way deeded to and maintained by the City of Madison once the
subdivision has been accepted into the Citys maintenance program For
safety purposes, planting material in the landscape area is limited to three
(3) feet in height or for trees, the mature height of the branches shall be
higher than seven (7) feet when placed near the paved path. A note on the
plat shall indicate the landscape, fence (if any) and building regulations
for this area. The use of bark or other loose material shall be designed or
located to keep the bark from being blown onto the paved path.
6-1-5 Neighborhood Recreation Areas. When deemed to be in the interest of the public.
the Planning Commission may require the dedication of park land within the subdivision,
subject to the criteria herein. When Planning Commission staff determines that it is
desirable to provide a neighborhood recreation area to meet the need for recreation
facilities generated by the proposed subdivision, the staff shall perform an evaluation
pursuant to Ordinance No. 94-110. The staff of the Planning Commission shall submit to
the Planning Commission a written report of its findings and conclusions. Such report
shall summarize the staffs findings for each step of the evaluation as described in
51
Section 5 of Ordinance 94-110, as may from time to time be amended. The report shall
also state any specific interests or concerns identified by the staff that may be impacted
by the proposed subdivision (as described in Section 6 of Ordinance 94-110, as may from
time to time be amended), as well as any existing facilities considered in the staff
evaluation. If the Planning Commission staff determines that it is recommended and
justifiable, then the Planning Commission may require the dedication of property for park
and/or recreation purposes as a condition of Final Plat approval. If property is required to
be dedicated, it shall be located as designated in the comprehensive plan or otherwise
where appropriate, as determined by the Planning Commission.
In the application of Ordinance 94-110 to the analysis of the impacts and mitigation
thereof of new development with respect to recreational needs of the City, the staff shall
prepare a report that addresses the following questions according to the instructions
specified. Said report shall be prepared for any project for which a site plan certificate or
other development order is required.
1. Does the project create the need for recreation?
a. Is it non-residential?
b. Is there any basis for a total waiver based on lack of impact?
c. Does developer propose to provide for recreation privately? If yes, will it be of a
character and extent at least equal to City standards?
d. Is there any other reason that recreation impact should not be mitigated (e.g.,
doing so would conflict with another important public purpose)?
(If no to all above, continue. If yes to any one, waive requirement.)
2. Does sufficient recreational opportunity already exist?
a. Is there a park or a school with recreational facilities within one mile (radially) of
every proposed unit? (Yes - go to 2b/No - go to 3)
b. If so, are the total number of acres of public recreational land in a one-mile radial
area, centered on the project, equal to at least three per 1000 potential residents in
the area? (Draw a one-mile radius circle centered on the project. Project buildout
population in the circle based on current zoning. Exclude existing residents with
access to private recreation facilities comparable to City standards. Allow 18%
for right-of-way for any area that has not been subdivided. Determine total
available public recreation land in the circle. If there are at least three acres per
1000 potential population, stop. If not, proceed to next step.)
3. What is the impact of the development?
a. Based on the Preliminary Plat or site plan, how many units are planned for the
project? (If under 60 single family detached or 93 multifamily units, standards
yield less than 0.5 ac. required donation, and impact shall be deemed
insignificant. No dedication required. If not, continue to 3b)
52
b. If Preliminary Plat or site plan contains more than 59 single family or 92
multifamily units, calculate donation at 3 ac./1000 residents of project. Use
household size of 2.8 for single family detached, 1.8 for multifamily.
4. Size Threshold; Potential Assembly of Future Land
a. If donation is to be required, is it at least 2 acres? (See answer to 3b above). Is
there suitable access, either by a public street or by public access easement? If
yes to both, require donation. The Planning Commission may require, in order
to facilitate pedestrian access from the roads to schools, parks, playgrounds, or
other nearby roads, perpetual unobstructed easements or public rights-ofway
at least ten (10) feet in width. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
Location to be chosen by developer/landowner subject to Planning Commission
approval. If it is not possible to provide adequate access, proceed to 4b.
b. Can a location be found where adjacent land is available adjacent for future
assembly into larger parcel? (to qualify, adjacent land must be vacant,
environmentally acceptable, zoned residential (including residual land zoned
RC-1 or RC-2 but excluding land enjoying any vested development rights), and
otherwise suitable for park development in the opinion of the Director of Parks
and Recreation). If no, stop - no dedication required. If yes, require donation
adjacent to such suitable parcel. If there is more than one suitable parcel,
developer may decide on location of dedication subject to approval of the
Planning Commission.
The developer or builder of any project for which a site plan certificate is required
shall be required to submit sufficient information to the staff to permit a
determination pursuant to these regulations.
The developer or builder of any project for which a site plan certificate is required
may voluntarily prepare the report required in Section 1 of this regulation, to which
staff will affix their comments and independent findings if different from the
developers report.
The staff, including the City Planner and Director of Parks and Recreation or their
designees, will make a written recommendation to the Planning Commission on any
project for which a site plan certificate is required with respect to any required
recreational exaction and the reasons therefore, or the reasons for the recommended
waiver thereof. This recommendation shall be made available to the Planning
Commission no later than the opening of the record of the public hearing or other
public meeting on the proposed development.
6-1-6 Sewerage Facilities
General Requirements. The applicant shall install sanitary sewer facilities in a manner
prescribed by the City of Madison Water and Wastewater Board construction standards
and specifications. All plans shall be designed and approved in accordance with the
rules, regulations, and standards of the City of Madison and the Board.
53
Sanitary sewers shall be provided where a public sanitary sewerage system is
reasonably accessible as determined by the Water and Wastewater Board. Individual
disposal systems shall be used in instances where no public sanitary sewerage system
is available, as determined by the Water and Wastewater Board, providing approval is
received from the State and County Health Departments.
6-1-7 Water Facilities
The applicant, in accordance with the Water Main Extension Policy of the Water and
Wastewater Board, will be responsible for bearing the cost of providing water service to
the subdivision, unless exempted by the Water and Wastewater Board. All potable water
facilities shall be approved by the Board, whose approval of the subdivision construction
plans submitted with the Preliminary Plat will be construed by the Planning Commission
to certify both that (1) the on-site system is designed to standards and specifications
acceptable to the Board, and (2) that there is sufficient capacity in the Citys potable
water system to serve the development.
6-1-8 Fire Protection
(a) Fire Hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions. Fire
hydrants shall be located no more than five hundred (500) feet apart, measured as
required by Insurance Services Office Standards. Fire hydrants shall be red in color,
specifically, Sherwin-Williams Company, KEM 400 Custom Enamel, Red 11105 or
equivalent approved by the City of Madison Fire Chief. To eliminate future street
openings, all underground utilities for fire hydrants themselves and all other supply
improvements shall be installed before any final paving of a street shown on the
subdivision plat. In the case of certain land uses where the need can be documented,
the Planning Commission may require the spacing of fire hydrants closer than 500 ft.
(b) Fire Flow requirements. The Preliminary Plat shall show minimum design fire flows
at each fire hydrant (static pressure and volume); or, alternatively, the plat may show
minimum fire flow data for all fire hydrants, such that no fire hydrant in the subdivision
will have fire flow capabilities less than the indicated fire flows. Such fire flows shall be
sufficient, in the judgment of the Fire Chief, to protect the structures intended to be
constructed in the subdivision based on the Building and Fire Prevention Codes in effect
at the time of Preliminary Plat approval.
6-1-9 Drainage and Storm Sewers
(a) General Requirements. The Planning Commission shall not approve any plat or
subdivision which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood
water runoff channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where
required, shall be designed by acceptable engineering methods as approved by
the City Engineer. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried
for a distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter. When calculations
indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall
54
be made for flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used to intercept flow
at that point.
(b) The following level of service standards shall be observed in the design of the
subdidivisions stormwater system:
-Lowest Floor Residential: 100 Year
-Required Yards 25 Year
-Local Streets and drainage structures 10 Year
-Collector and Arterial Roads
and drainage structures
serving to collect water
from more than one subdivision 25 Year
-Open Channels 25 Year
All levels of service are based on a Type II 24-hour Storm.
(c) Nature of Storm Water Facilities
1. Location. The applicant may be required by the Planning Commission to
carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may
exist either previously to or as a result of the subdivision. Such
drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible,
or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall
be constructed in accordance with the construction standards and
specifications of the City of Madison.
2. Accessibility to Public Storm Sewers. Where a public storm sewer is
accessible, the applicant shall install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets
are within a reasonable distance, adequate provision shall be made for
the disposal of storm water, subject to the specifications of the City of
Madison.
3. Accommodation of Upstream Drainage Areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate
potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or
outside the subdivision. The City Engineer shall determine the necessary
size of the facility based on the provisions of the construction standards
and specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed
development permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.
4. Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas. The City Engineer shall also study
the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities
outside the area of the subdivision. Where it is anticipated that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will
overload an existing downstream drainage facility, the Planning
Commission may withhold approval of the subdivision until provision
has been made for the improvement of said potential condition in such
55
manner as the Planning Commission shall determine. No
subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to
an adequate drainage water course or facility.
5. Areas of Poor Drainage. Whenever a plat is submitted for an area which
is subject to flooding, the Planning Commission may approve such
subdivision provided that the applicant fills the affected area of said
subdivision to an elevation sufficient to place the elevation of streets
and lots at a minimum of twelve (12) inches above the elevation of the
maximum probable flood, as determined by the City Engineer. The plat of
such subdivision shall provide for an overflow zone along the bank of any
stream or watercourse, in a width which shall be sufficient in times of
high water to contain or move the water, and no fill shall be placed in the
overflow zone nor shall any structure be erected or placed therein. The
boundaries of the overflow zone shall be subject to approval by the
City Engineer. Areas of extremely poor drainage should be discouraged
from development.
6. Floodway Areas. The Planning Commission may when it deems it necessary
for the health, safety, or welfare of the present and future population
of the area and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage, and
sanitary facilities, prohibit the subdivision of any portion of the property
which lies within the floodway of any stream or drainage course. These
floodway areas shall be preserved from any and all destruction or
damage resulting from clearing, grading, or dumping of earth, waste
material, or stumps, except at the discretion of the Planning Commission.
(c) Dedication of Drainage Easements
(1) General Requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a
storm water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to
the lines of such watercourse, and of such width and construction or both as
will be adequate for the purpose. Whenever possible, it is desirable that
the drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks
and adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow.
(2) Drainage Easements.
(a) Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rightsof-
way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least fifteen (15) feet in
width for such drainage facilities shall be provided across property
outside the road lines and with satisfactory access to the road.
Easements shall be indicated on the plat. Drainage easements shall be
carried from the road to a natural watercourse or to other drainage
facilities.
56
(b) When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be
secured by the applicant and indicated on the plat.
(c) The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement, land on both sides of existing water courses, to a
distance to be determined by the Planning Commission.
(d) Low-lying lands along water courses subject to flooding or overflowing
during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as
drainageways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not
be computed in determining the number of lots to be utilized for
average density, nor for computing the area requirement of any lot.
6-1-10 Signs. All signs erected on public property within the plat of the subdivision
shall meet all adopted City regulations, including, without limitation, the requirements of
the Federal Highway Administration Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, latest
edition. The City shall erect all such signs according to a plan prepared by the Public
Works Director. The applicant shall pay to the City them sum of eighty-five dollars
($85.00) for each required sign within the subdivision.
6-1-11 Oversize Facilities. The City Council may participate in the cost of
oversized improvements within a subdivision, if in its judgment such oversized
improvements are necessary to serve large areas of land not in the subdivision, and if
the cost of such oversize improvements is an unreasonable burden on the
applicant.
6-1-12
a) Utilities. The applicant is required to place all utilities underground, except as
provided below. The preliminary or Certified Plat shall specify whether proposed
utilities are to be placed underground or above-ground, including electric service,
telephone lines, and cable television lines. All utility facilities existing and proposed
throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the Preliminary Plat. Easements centered
on rear and/or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities (private and municipal);
such easements shall be at least ten (10) feet wide. Proper coordination shall be
established between the applicant and the applicable utility companies for the
establishment of utility easements. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
Applicants are encouraged to be knowledgeable of City and utility company street
lighting standards.
(b) The Planning Commission may, by majority vote, permit the installation of aboveground
electric, cable television, or telephone service if it concludes that one or more of
the following conditions are met:
1. above-ground service would enhance the public safety
2. above-ground service would be in the interest of preservation of the character of
the area or adjacent areas, and/or the Planning Commission desires to pursue this
goal for the area under development
57
3. the City Engineer certifies that installation of underground utilities is not good
engineering practice due to physical attributes particular to the land being
developed
4. as a variance pursuant to Article IX of these Subdivision Regulations
6-1-13 Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined
by the Planning Commission, shall be constructed at the full expense of the
applicant without reimbursement from the City of Madison. The sharing expense for
the construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as determined by
the Planning Commission, will be fixed by special agreement between the City
Council and the applicant. Said cost shall be charged to the applicant prorata as the
percentage of his land developed and so served.
6-1-14 Widening and Realignment of Existing Roads. Where a subdivision borders an
existing narrow road, the Planning Commission staff shall perform an evaluation
pursuant to Ordinance No. 94-110. The staff of the Planning Commission shall submit to
the Planning Commission a written report of its findings and conclusions. Such report
shall summarize the staffs findings for each step of the evaluation as described in
Section 5 of Ordinance 94-110, as may from time to time be amended. The report shall
also state any specific interests or concerns identified by the staff that may be impacted
by the proposed subdivision (as described in Section 6 of Ordinance 94-110, as may from
time to time be amended), as well as any existing facilities considered in the staff
evaluation. If the Planning Commission staff determines that it is recommended and
justifiable, then the Planning Commission may require the dedication of such areas for
widening or realignment of such roads as a condition of approval of the Final Plat of said
subdivision. Such rights-of-way for roads and streets shall be dedicated by the applicant
to the full width as required by these Subdivision Regulations. Property reserved for any
road purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance, whether the property is to be dedicated to the City in fee simple or an
easement is granted to the City of Madison.
6-1-15 Bikeways, Greenways, and Single-or-Multi-Purpose Trails.
a. The Planning Commission may, at its discretion, require the installation of
bikeways, greenways, and single-or-multi-purpose trails within any proposed
subdivision. The location of such facilities shall be consistent with the Greenway
Trails Element of the Citys Comprehensive Plan, and may be dedicated
voluntarily by the developer, or may be required pursuant to the provisions of
Ordinance 94-110. In the event that the developer does not wish to donate a
facility depicted on the Greenways Trails Element Map within the plat of the
subdivision, and an evaluation performed pursuant to Ordinance 94-110 does not
support involuntary exaction, the City may acquire the facility through voluntary
purchase or eminent domain.
b. Curb cuts and ramps shall be installed on streets where such facilities are required
by these regulations or by the Comprehensive Plan. Specifications for such
facilities shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and City regulations.
58
Section 6-2. Permanent Reference Points

straight boundary line.
(c) Property Monuments of ferrous pipe or round or square ferrous bars not less than
0.50 inches in diameter and not less than eighteen (18) inches in length
weighing not less than 3.65 pounds per lineal foot. Any durable metal or
concrete monument may be used in lieu of ferrous pipes provided that they
are uniform within the platted area and have permanent magnets embedded
near the top and the bottom.
6-2-2 Cadastral Reference Points. A minimum of two (2) cadastral control
monuments shall be placed at accessible locations within the subdivision and shall
be referenced by course and distance from an accepted corner of the government survey
of Madison County or previously placed and accepted cadastral control monuments
which are not contiguous to the subject subdivision boundary. At the discretion of the
Administrative Officer these monuments may also serve as subdivision boundary
monumentation. Cadastral monuments shall appear on the Final Plat, together with the
description in bearings and distances to an accuracy of 1:10,000, of their location
from the reference monuments.
6-2-3 Subdivision Boundary Monumentation. The external boundaries of a
subdivision shall be monumented in the field with boundary monuments which shall

line, said points to be not less than twenty (20) feet back from the bank of any river,
stream, or major drainage way; except that when such corners fall within a street, or
proposed future street, the monuments shall be placed on the side line of the
59
street. The monuments shall be spaced so as to be within sight of each other and shall
be placed not more than 1,400 feet apart in any straight line.
6-2-4 Internal Block Monumentation. Boundary monuments shall be placed at
all internal boundaries, corners, and points not referenced above and at all block
corners, at each end of all curves, at the point where a curve changes radius, and at

60
ARTICLE VII
ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE
OF IMPROVEMENTS
Section 7-l Improvements
(a). Completion of Improvements
Prior to Final Plat approval, the applicant shall complete, in a manner satisfactory to
the Planning Commission and the City Engineer, all improvements required in these
regulations, specified in the final subdivision plat, and as approved by the Planning
Commission and to dedicate same to the City of Madison free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances on the property and public improvements thus dedicated.
(b) Improvements to be Dedicated to the Water and Wastewater Board.
All sanitary sewer and potable water facilities (excluding easement and fee rights to real
property), once constructed, accepted and dedicated to public use, shall become the
property of the Water and Wastewater Board of the City of Madison. Consequently, a
separate dedication procedure shall be required for these improvements, and the Water
and Wastewater Board shall prescribe the manner of said dedication. The Boards
approval and acceptance of potable water and sanitary sewer facilities for a subdivision
shall satisfy the requirements of this section with respect to those facilities.
Section 7-2. Method of Guarantee
(a) Guarantees for City Improvements.
In lieu of requiring the completion of all improvements prior to Final Plat approval, the
City may, at its discretion, enter into a contract with the applicant whereby the
applicant shall guarantee to complete all improvements, required by these
regulations or otherwise specified by the Planning Commission, in a manner satisfactory
to the Planning Commission. To secure this contract, the applicant shall provide, subject
to the approval of the Planning Commission, the following guarantee:
The applicant shall deposit cash, or other instrument readily convertible into cash at
face value, either with the City or in escrow with a bank. Such deposit shall be
irrevocable by the applicant during the period of validity, and shall be payable to the City
upon the applicants failure to comply with any provisions of this article. The use of any
instrument other than cash and, in the case of an escrow account, the bank with which
the funds are to be deposited, shall be subject to the approval of the Planning
Commission. Any such instrument (including a letter of credit) shall be valid for one
month longer than the period allowed for construction of improvements under Section 7-
3-1 below. The amount of the cash deposited or the amount of any instrument other than
cash accepted by the Planning Commission shall be at least equal to 120% of the cost
as estimated by the applicant and approved by the City Engineer of installing all
required improvements. Interest accrued shall be payable to the applicant.
61
In the case of an escrow account, the applicant shall file with the Planning
Commission an agreement between the financial bank and himself guaranteeing the
following:
(1) That the funds of said escrow account shall be held in trust until released by the
Planning Commission and may not be used or pledged by the applicant as
security in any other matter during that period;
(2) And that in the case of a failure on the part of the applicant to complete
said improvements, then the bank shall immediately make the funds in said
account available to the City for use in the completion of those improvements.
(b) Guarantees Required by the Water and Wastewater Board.
The Water and Wastewater Board may elect to accept improvement guarantees, pursuant
to the rules of the Board. If the Board does choose to accept an improvement guarantee,
the developer shall post the form of guarantee as agreed, separate and apart from any
guarantee accepted by the City. The Board may choose to sign the Final Plat of the
subdivision based on the posting of a guarantee acceptable to it.
Section 7-3. Time Limits
7-3-1 Deadline. Prior to the granting of Final Plat approval, the applicant, the
Planning Commission, and the Water and Wastewater Board shall agree upon a deadline
for the completion of all required improvements, such deadline to be one year from the
date of Final Plat approval, unless a longer period, not to exceed (two) years, is
approved by the Planning Commission and the Water and Wastewater Board. The
Planning Commission, with the consent of the Water and Wastewater Board, shall have
the power to extend that deadline for (one) additional year (up to a total of two years)
where the applicant can present substantial reason for doing so.
7-3-2 Failure to be Accepted. If any portion of the required improvements shall
fail to be accepted for dedication in compliance with these regulations within the
allocated time period, either for reason of incompletion or for reason of substandard
construction, then the Planning Commission shall take the following action:
Where improvements have been guaranteed under Section 7-2 of these
regulations, the Planning Commission shall declare whatever security has been
pledged as a guarantee to be forfeit. Where the Planning Commission is not already
in possession of said guarantee, it shall immediately take the actions necessary to
obtain it. Upon receipt of these securities, the Planning Commission shall use them,
or receipts from their sale if that be necessary, to finance the completion of
contracted improvements or the rebuilding of such improvements to the proper
specifications. Unused portions of these securities shall be returned to the
applicant, bonding company, or crediting institution, as is appropriate.
62
Section 7-4. Improvement Requirements
7-4-1 Inspection and Certification
The City Engineer and the Administrative Officer shall regularly inspect for defects
in the construction of the required improvements. The applicant shall pay to the
City an inspection fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per lot, and the subdivision plat
shall not be signed by the Chairman of the Planning Commission unless such fee
has been paid at the time of application. These fees shall be due and payable upon
demand of the City and no building permits or certificates of occupancy shall be
issued until all fees are paid. If the City Engineer finds upon inspection that any of the
required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the Citys
construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for
completing the improvements. Wherever the cost of improvements is covered by an
improvement guarantee, the applicant and any guarantor(s) shall be severally and
jointly liable for completing the improvements according to specifications.
The Water and Wastewater Board shall conduct independent inspections of all
infrastructure anticipated to be accepted by the Board, and shall notify the City Engineer
of the status of these inspections and the acceptability of the work. Failure of the Water
and Wastewater Board to approve the work within the time limits established under
Section 7-3-1 above shall cause the applicant and any party guaranteeing acceptable
completion of the work to be jointly and severally liable for completing the
improvements according to specifications.
Upon completion of these improvements, the City Engineer and Water and
Wastewater Board shall file with the Planning Commission a statement either
certifying that the improvements have been completed in the specific manner or
listing the defects in those improvements.
Upon completion of the improvements, the applicant shall file with the Planning
Commission a statement stipulating the following:
(a) that all required improvements are complete;
(b) that these improvements are in compliance with the standards specified by the
Planning Commission and the City Council for their construction;
(c) that the applicant knows of no defects from any cause in those improvements;
(d) and that these improvements are free and clear of any encumbrances or lien.
The applicant shall also file with the Planning Commission an agreement dedicating
said improvements. This agreement shall specify that all improvements, including all
interests in real property except for potable water and sanitary sewer infrastructure are
dedicated to the City, and that all potable water and sanitary sewer infrastructure are
dedicated to the Water and Wastewater Board.
If the project Engineer has certified that the contracted improvements are complete
and free from defect, and said improvements have passed inspection by the City
Engineering Inspector, then upon receipt of the other statements and agreements
63
detailed above, the City shall accept the dedication of those improvements. The City
may, at its discretion, accept the dedication of any portion of the required
improvements, provided that all statements and agreements specified above have
been received for that portion of the improvements. Improvements to be dedicated to the
Water and Wastewater Board shall be accepted by the Board according to that Boards
rules. In no instance, however, will the Planning Commission grant acceptance to the
infrastructure within any subdivision or part thereof until after the water and sanitary
sewer systems within that subdivision or part of the subdivision have been accepted by
the Water and Wastewater Board.
7-4-2 Change Orders to Require Approval. The City Engineer and Planning,
Engineering and Building Director shall endorse all engineering and materials change
orders to improvements specified in the subdivision construction plans as approved
by the Planning Commission. The Administrative Officer shall take appropriate
action to ensure compliance with approved plans and specifications and the developer
shall be notified when unauthorized changes to the plans are detected.
Noncompliant improvements will not be accepted and neither the Planning
Commission nor the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall be empowered to grant postinstallation
variances for non-compliant improvements. Engineering Change
Orders relating only to sanitary sewer and potable water systems, which do not require
relocation of easements or rights-of-way, shall be submitted to the Water and Wastewater
Board for approval and shall not require Planning Commission action, provided,
however, that such Change Orders must be reported to the City Engineer and shall be
reflected on the As-built engineering drawings of the Subdivision that are presented to
the City and the Water and Wastewater Board.
Section 7-5. Reduction of Guarantees
In those cases where improvement guarantees have been made under Subsection 7-2-l,
7-2-2, or 7-2-3 of these regulations, the amount of the guarantee may be reduced
upon acceptance, in compliance with these regulations, of the dedication of a portion of
the required improvements. An improvement guarantee shall be reduced upon actual
dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the public
improvement dedicated bears to the total public improvements for the plat. In no event
shall an improvement guarantee be reduced below twenty-five percent (25%) of the
principal amount.
Section 7-6. Maintenance of Improvements
The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond with the City Council, prior
to dedication, in an amount considered adequate by the City Engineer (but in no case less
than 15% of the value of the improvements) and in a form satisfactory to the City
Attorney, in order to assure the satisfactory condition of the required improvements for a
period of two years after the date of their acceptance by the City of Madison and
dedication of same to the City of Madison. The Water and Wastewater Board may
require the posting of a maintenance bond and security therefor with the Board in order to
assure the satisfactory condition of the sanitary sewer and potable water systems for a
period of one year after their acceptance by the Board. Failure of the developer to post
any maintenance bond or security required by the Board may constitute cause for denial
of acceptance by the Board of the improvements. Any and all maintenance bonds shall be
secured in the same manner as that required for improvement bonds under Section 7-2
64
above. Posting of any type of security other than cash shall be subject to approval by the
Planning Commission or Water and Wastewater Board, as appropriate.
Section 7-7. Issuance of Building Permits and Certificates of Occupancy.
Where an improvement guarantee has been required for a subdivision, no
certificate of occupancy for any building in the subdivision shall be issued prior to the
completion of the improvements and dedication of same to the City, as required in the
Planning Commissions final approval of the subdivision plat.
No building permit shall be issued for the final ten percent (10%) of lots in a
subdivision, or if ten percent (10%) be less than two (2), for the final two (2) lots of a
subdivision, until all public improvements required by the Planning Commission for the
plat have been fully completed and dedicated to the City.
Notwithstanding the above, no building permit shall be issued for any lot for which there
is not both:
a. a live fire hydrant within 250 ft. of the lot, and
b. an all-weather surface road giving access to the lot from a dedicated street.
Section 7-8. Release of Guarantee
Upon acceptance, in accordance with these regulations of the dedication of the final
portion of improvements, the City shall authorize the release of the remaining portion of
the improvement guarantee.
Section 7-9. Additional Rules for Subdivision Improvement Guarantees
When the Planning Commission is requested to accept an improvement guarantee for
improvements expected to cost more than $10,000.00, then the following rules shall
apply:
1. The amount of the guarantee shall be based upon one of the following:
a. the sum of the monetary consideration for all signed contracts for
improvements into which the developer has entered, provided that contracts
for all improvements indicated by the construction plans for said
improvements have been executed; or
b. where no such contracts have been executed, the sum of the estimates of the
costs of all improvements indicated by the construction plans, as estimated by
the City Engineer;
c. where some, but not all such contracts have been executed, by the sum of the
monetary consideration for all such contracts plus estimates of the cost of all
improvements not yet contracted for, said estimates to comply with all
provisions of ss. 7-9 (1) (b).
2. All costs of developing construction estimates for improvement guarantees shall
be borne by the developer, who shall reimburse the City at its cost for said
65
services. Failure to reimburse the City within 30 days of the Planning
Commission meeting at which the Final Plat is approved shall void the Final Plat,
and the Chairman shall not sign the Final Plat.
3. For purposes of determining a value for the improvement guarantee, the value of
the improvements calculated pursuant to Section 7-9 (1) above shall be reduced
by the value of improvements already installed and inspected by the City.
4. All requests by developers to post Subdivision Improvement guarantees shall be
made in writing at least 30 calendar days prior to the meeting of the Planning
Commission at which the Final Plat relating to said guarantees is to be considered.
5. In addition to the monetary amounts required in ss. 7-9-(1), any developer
desiring to post an improvement guarantee shall add 20% to the cost of
improvements of the value of the improvements to be guaranteed to cover
materials price increases, contingencies, administrative expenses and other
expenses. This amount shall be included in the improvement guarantee.
6. The developer agrees with the City that the city shall hire a professional land
developer, State-licensed contractor, or registered professional engineer to
supervise any construction that is undertaken with proceeds from an improvement
guarantee. The administrative fee of 20% of the value of the improvements, as
required in Section 7-9 (4) above, will be used to defer the cost of the
professional fee of the individual hired in this capacity.
7. All improvement guarantees required to be posted by the Planning Commission as
a condition of the granting of a Final Plat must be posted and accepted within 30
days after the Planning Commission meeting at which the Final Plat is approved.
Failure to meet this deadline shall automatically void the Final Plat.
Section 7-10. Bonding of Sidewalk Improvements (Resolution 91-2)
Not withstanding any of the provisions of this article, any developer may post a separate
bond guaranteeing the construction of sidewalks required by the Planning Commission or
these regulations within two years from the date of Final Plat approval. Security for the
bond, in the form of cash or a letter of credit shall be valid for at least twenty-five months
from the date the security is received by the City. The developer may specify, by
notation on the Final Plat, that individual home builders are required to construct said
sidewalks adjacent to their building sites as a condition precedent to issuance of the
Certificate of Occupancy thereto. If sidewalks are not completed within two years as
guaranteed by the posted and secured bond, the City shall call the security for the
sidewalk bond and complete any sidewalks not yet constructed, or which are in disrepair,
or which are nonconforming to requirements set forth in Article 6-1-3 of the City of
Madison Subdivision Regulations, returning all unspent funds to the developer.
Extensions of the time for completion of sidewalks for which a the city has accepted a
sidewalk bond and security therefor may be granted, at the discretion of the Planning
Commission, provided an acceptable bond and adequate security are posted for the
extended period. In no event, however, shall the posting of a sidewalk bond in lieu of
construction of sidewalks prevent the acceptance of all other improvements, or the
issuance of Certificates of Occupancy pursuant to Section 7-7 herein.
66

agreements are not inconsistent with these regulations or other law or regulation, and
impose stricter requirements than these regulations, the stricter requirements shall
control.
Section 8-3. Separability
If any part or provision of these regulations or application thereof to any person or
circumstances is adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment
shall be confined in its operation to the part, provision, or application directly involved
in all controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not affect
or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the application thereof
to other persons or circumstances. The Planning Commission hereby declares that it
would have enacted the remainder of these regulations even without any such
part, provision, or application.
Section 8-4. Saving Provision
These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending under, or
by virtue of, prior existing subdivision regulations, or as discontinuing, abating,
67
modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue, or as affecting the
liability of any person, firm, or corporation, or as waiving any right of the City under any
section or provision existing at the time of adoption of these regulations, or as
vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any person, firm, or corporation, by
lawful action of the City except as shall be expressly provided for in these regulations.

Planning Commission for design, dedication, improvement, and restrictive use of the
land so as to conform to the physical and economical development of the City and to
the safety and general welfare of the future owners in the subdivision and of the
community at large.
Section 8-8. Resubdivision of Land
8-8-1 Procedure for Resubdivision. For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on such map,
or area reserved thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it affects any map or
plan legally reached prior to the adoption of any regulations controlling
subdivisions, such parcel shall be approved by the Planning Commission by the same
procedure, rules and regulations as for a subdivision.
8-8-2 Procedure for Subdivisions Where Future Resubdivision is Indicated.
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or more
lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that such
lots will eventually be resubdivided into small building sites, the Planning
Commission may require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening of streets
and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for the
future opening and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of the plat.

copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring the same to be vacated.
(B) Such an instrument shall be approved by the Planning Commission in like

provisions of these regulations, and filed with the Probate Judge of Madison
County.
(C) The subdivision of any lot or any parcel of land, by any means, for the purpose
of sale, transfer, or lease with the intent of evading these regulations, shall not
be permitted. All such described subdivisions shall be subject to all of the
requirements contained in these regulations.
(D) No building permit shall be issued for the construction of any building or

approved by the Planning Commission and recorded or filed in the office of the Probate
Judge of Madison County, shall forfeit and pay a penalty of one hundred dollars for each
lot or parcel so transferred or sold or agreed or negotiated to be sold; and the description

penalties or from the remedies herein provided. The City may enjoin such transfer or
sale or agreement by action for injunction brought in any court of equity jurisdiction
or may recover the same penalty by a civil action in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

ARTICLE IX
VARIANCES
Section 9-1. General
Where the Planning Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or practical
difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations and/or the purposes
of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may
approve variances to these subdivision regulations so that substantial justice may be
done and the public interest secured, provided that such variance shall not have the
effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and further provided
the Planning Commission shall not approve variances unless it shall make findings
based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
(A) The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public safety, health,
or welfare or injurious to other property;
(B) The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are unique to the
property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable generally to
other property.
(C) Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner
would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience or diminution of
economic value, if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out;
(D) The hardship claimed has in no way been caused by the land owner;
(E) The variances will not in any manner vary the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance, Comprehensive Plan, or other adopted plans, policies, and
regulations of the City.
Section 9-2. Conditions
In approving variances, the Planning Commission may require such conditions as will,
in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements of
these regulations.
Section 9-3. Procedures
A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in writing by the applicant at the time
when the Layout Plat is filed for the consideration of the Planning Commission. The
petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all of the facts relied upon
by the petitioner. The variance, if approved by the Planning Commission, shall become
part of the official record of the Planning Commission and shall be noted on the Final
Plat.
