PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Darien, Connecticut. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1972 Code, as supplemented, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Representative Town Meeting. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1972 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Ellen K. Torof, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to John N. Crary, Administrative Officer, and John Wayne Fox, Town Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

Said board shall lay such tax upon the grand list of said town last completed as it shall deem necessary and may fix the time when such tax shall become due and payable.

(2)  If the fund is insufficient to satisfy all liabilities in full, then the assets of the fund shall be applied in the following order: 
a.  First, to provide to each member an amount equal to his contributions and former plan allocation, with credited interest thereon, to the earliest of his normal or earlier retirement date, whichever is applicable, or the date of termination, reduced by the amount of any payments made to such member, which amount shall reduce the amounts necessary to provide retirement benefit payments set forth in categories Second through Fifth below;

Each of the foregoing five categories with the exception of the Second shall be determined as of the date of termination of the plan, and such categories other than the First are hereinafter referred to as "classes." 
(3)  If upon the application of the assets of the fund in the order of priority to provide payment in part of liabilities to members and beneficiaries in one of the four classes, there are assets available for that class but not sufficient to satisfy such liabilities in full, the assets available for that class shall be applied rateably on the basis of the proportions which the available assets bear to the present values of the accrued retirement benefits of all members and beneficiaries in that class. 
(4)  Upon the termination of the plan, the fund may be continued in existence and the assets applied to the benefit of the several classes set forth above, or the fund may be distributed in the manner set forth below, or a combination thereof: 
a.  By the distribution to each member or beneficiary of the present value of what such member or beneficiary is entitled to receive, either in one lump sum or in installments over a period of not more than five years; or 
b.  By the purpose of annuity contracts of such types as the board shall determine for the members and beneficiaries from an insurance company or companies. 
(5)  In the event that the plan is terminated or the full current costs thereof have not been met at any time before July 1, 1981, the benefits which any of the 25 highest paid employees, as hereinafter determined, may receive, shall not exceed the largest of the following amounts: 
a.  $20,000.00; or 
b.  The amount of town contributions which would have been applied to provide retirement benefits for such employee if the former plan had been continued without change. 
c.  The amount which would have been provided by town contributions under the former plan if it had been terminated on June 30, 1971, plus an amount equal to 20 percent of the employee's average regular annual compensation for the five years preceding the date of termination or $10,000.00, whichever is the smaller, multiplied by the number of years since July 1, 1971. 
(6)  If the full current costs of the plan are not met as of July 1, 1981, then until such costs have been met, the amount of benefits paid under the plan to any of the 25 highest paid employees from town contributions shall not exceed the amount thereof which would have been paid when limited as provided in subsection (5) above. 
(7)  These conditions shall not restrict the current payment of full retirement benefits of any retired member while the plan is in full effect and its full current costs have been met. In the event that any funds are realized by operation of the restrictions set forth herein, they shall be used to reduce subsequent town contributions of the plan, but, if the town has ceased its contributions, they shall be used for the benefit of members other than the 25 highest paid employees on a basis which shall not result in substantial discrimination in favor of the more highly compensated employees. 
(8)  For the purpose of this division, the 25 highest paid employees shall mean the 25 highest paid employees as of July 1, 1971, including any such highly paid employees who are not members at that time but who may later become members, but excluding any employee whose annual retirement benefit provided by the town contributions will not exceed $1,500.00. 
(9)  After the fulfillment of all obligations to members and their beneficiaries provided for in this division, any portion of the fund remaining as a result of actuarial error may be returned to the town.

Sec. 50-258. - Methods of accomplishing retirement. 
(a)  Procedure. The retirement from the police department of a member thereof shall be accomplished by one of the following methods, except as provided in section 50-259(b): 
(1)  Voluntary retirement. A member of the police department who shall have been in the service of the town as a regular police officer for 25 years, exclusive of time served as a supernumerary or special police officer, and who shall have reached the age of 55 years, may, at his option, retire from the police department at any time until he shall reach the age of 65 years, provided that, effective July 1, 1973, a member of the police department who shall have been in the service of the town as a regular police officer for 20 years, exclusive of time served as a supernumerary or special police officer, may, at his option, retire from the police department at any time until compulsory retirement, regardless of age. 
(2)  Compulsory retirement because of age. Any member of the police department who shall have reached the age of 65 years shall be automatically retired. 
(3)  Compulsory retirement by order of the police commission. Any member of the police department who shall have reached the age of 50 years may be retired by order of the police commission acting in its sole discretion. 
(4)  Compulsory retirement because of disability. The board of police commissioners may retire any member of the police department who shall have become permanently unfit for duty on a certificate of a doctor or doctors appointed by the board of police commissioners, certifying that such member is permanently unable to perform ordinary police duties, and that such unfitness and inability was caused by some injury received while performing the duties of his service without fault on his part. The retirement of a member for disability, whether pursuant to the provisions of this subsection (a)(4) or as provided in hereinafter in section 50-259(b)(1), shall be coextensive with the member's disability. The police commission shall, upon application by such member, or may, upon its own motion, reexamine and redetermine such member's disability at any time after such disability has continued for one year. The finding of the board of police commissioners shall be final in all cases with respect to the fact of disability. 
(b)  Payment and computation of pension. 
(1)  Any member of the police department retired as provided in this section shall receive from the police pension fund a pension payable in equal monthly installments at the rate of 50 percent of the average monthly compensation received during the three years immediately preceding retirement, plus an additional two percent of such average monthly compensation for each year of service to the town as a regular police officer in excess of 25 years, provided that any member of the police department retired as provided in this section subsequent to July 1, 1973, shall receive from the police pension fund a pension payable in equal monthly installments at the rate of 21/2 percent of the average monthly compensation, excluding overtime, received during the 21 months immediately preceding retirement for each year of service to the town as a regular police officer, up to a maximum of 70 percent, except that for employees hired to begin work on or before January 1, 1978, overtime pay shall continue to be included in calculating retirement benefits and shall be averaged over the three years immediately preceding retirement. For this purpose, years of service shall be calculated to the nearest one-quarter of a year. 
(2)  Overtime pay will be excluded when computing pension benefits for employees hired to begin work after January 1, 1978, but will continue to be included when computing pension benefits for employees hired to begin work on or before January 1, 1978, for as long as they remain employees of the police department or are covered by the police pension fund of the town. 
(3)  Effective July 1, 1980, the annual retirement benefits paid under the police pension plan to retirees where the retirees retired prior to July 1, 1973, shall be increased by one percent for each year such member has been receiving the pension benefits between his date of retirement and June 30, 1980; and effective July 1, 1980, the annual retirement benefits paid under the police pension plan to survivors of retirees, where the retirees retired prior to July 1, 1973, shall be increased by two percent for each year such member or his survivor has been receiving the pension benefits between his date of retirement and June 30, 1980. 
(4)  Effective July 1, 1985, the annual retirement benefits paid under the police pension plan to retirees having more than 20 years of service or to survivors of such retirees, as the case may be, shall be increased as follows:

1.  If their pension is less than $5,000.00-15 percent increase; 
2.  If their pension is from $5,001.00 to $10,000.00-Ten percent increase; 
3.  If their pension is from $10,001.00 to $15,000.00-Six percent increase; 
4.  If their pension is over $15,000.00-Three percent increase. 
Retirees or survivors of retirees having from 11 to 20 years of service shall receive an increase equal to 50 percent of the above percentage increases for their pension bracket. Retirees or survivors of retirees having less than 11 years of service shall receive 25 percent of the above percentage increases for their pension bracket. 
(5)  Disability pension benefits will be reduced by workers' compensation benefits and benefits paid under G.S. § 7-433c. 
(c)  Pension benefits of spouse upon death of retiree. Upon the death of a member of the police department retired pursuant to the provisions of this section, his widow, if any, to whom he shall have been married for not less than three years prior to his retirement in case of retirement pursuant to subsection (a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section or to whom he shall be married at the time of retirement in case of retirement pursuant to subsection (a)(4) of this section, shall, during her widowhood, receive equal monthly payments from the police pension fund at the rate of 50 percent of the pension payments received by such deceased member of the police department after his retirement; provided that, upon the death of a member of the police department retired pursuant to the provisions of this section subsequent to July 1, 1970, his widow, if any, to whom he shall have been married for not less than three years prior to his retirement in case of retirement pursuant to subsection (a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section or to whom he shall be married at the time of retirement in case of retirement pursuant to subsection (a)(4) of this section, shall, during her widowhood, receive equal monthly payments from the police pension fund at the rate of 66 2/3 percent of the pension payments received by such deceased member of the police department after his retirement. 
(d)  Payment entitlements from fund. In the event that a member of the police department retired as provided in this section dies without leaving a widow entitled to payments from the police pension fund, but leaving a child or children under 18 years of age, or dies leaving a widow entitled to payments who dies or remarries before such member's children reach the age of 18 years, the payments herein provided to be made to a widow of a retired member of the police department shall be made to the legal guardian of such child or children under 18 years of age. 
(e)  Cease of payments contingent on remarriage or child attaining 18 years of age. All payments to the widow of a member of the police department shall cease upon her remarriage and all payments to the legal guardian of any child of a member of the police department shall cease upon such child reaching the age of 18 years. 
(f)  Method of computing years of service. In computing the years of service of any member of the police department for the purposes of this article, such member's service to the town as a regular police officer, exclusive of service prior to his last break in service or as a supernumerary or special policeman, shall be included, except as provided in section 50-261(c). Resignation, dismissal, or unauthorized absence not excused by the board of police commissioners shall constitute a break in service. 
(g)  Amounts payable as benefits. Effective July 1, 1970, amounts payable as pension benefits to members eligible for and receiving pensions on June 30, 1970, pursuant to this section or any special act concerning a police pension fund in the town approved by the representative town meeting on or after July 19, 1955, shall be increased by one percent for each year such member has been receiving the pension benefits between his date of retirement and June 30, 1970, calculated to the nearest year.

(1)  Equal monthly payments at the rate of 50 percent (or 66 2/3 percent if the death occurred subsequent to July 1, 1970) of the average monthly pay of such member of the police department during the three years of his service next preceding his death, or during the full extent of his service, whichever is less, plus two percent of the average monthly compensation of such member for each year that he shall have served the town as a police officer in excess of 25 years; or

If the police pension fund (the "fund") is terminated, or if there shall be a complete discontinuance of the contributions under the fund, the assets held in the fund (after provisions for payment of all expenses of final liquidation or termination) shall be allocated pursuant to the terms of this section. Such allocation shall be made for the purpose of providing retirement benefits determined by the board to have accrued under the fund to the date of termination of the fund. Such allocation shall be made on the basis of actuarial valuations provided to the board, and in the manner and order described in subsections (a)(1)-(a)(6) of this section.

(2)  Second, an amount shall be allocated, which when added to the amount indicated in subsection (a)(1) of this section, will be sufficient to provide retirement benefits to all persons who were receiving benefits on the date of termination of the fund and members remaining in the employ of the town who have reached their normal retirement date. 
(3)  Third, an amount shall be allocated, which when added to the amount indicated in subsection (a)(1) of this section, will be sufficient to provide retirement benefits for members still in the service of the town who were eligible to retire on an early retirement date. 
(4)  Fourth, an amount shall be allocated, which when added to the amount indicated in subsection (a)(1) of this section, will be sufficient to provide benefits earned to date by those members who have earned ten years of credited service (exclusive of time served as a supernumerary or special police officer), but are not identified in subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section. 
(5)  Fifth, amounts then remaining shall be allocated to provide benefits for all members not provided for above. 
(6)  Amounts allocated in accordance with subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this section may be applied in the discretion of the board to provide benefits through the purchase of paid-up annuities on an individual or group basis, through allocation of reserves within the then existing fund and/or under a separate fund instrument or through participation in any other retirement fund or by any combination of these alternatives or other means. 
(b)  Latest time for distribution. The latest time for a distribution or for commencement of distributions shall be the later of April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2; or April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the member retires. 
(c)  Exclusive benefit. No part of the corpus or income of the fund shall be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of members and their beneficiaries.

(1)  Compensation in excess of $200,000.00 shall be disregarded. Such amount shall be adjusted at the same time and in such manner as permitted under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, except that the dollar increase in effect on January 1 of any calendar year shall be effective for the fiscal year beginning with or within such calendar year and the first adjustment to the $200,000.00 limitation shall be effective on January 1, 1990. For any short fiscal year, the compensation limit shall be an amount equal to the compensation limit for the calendar year in which the fiscal year begins multiplied by the ratio obtained by dividing the number of full months in the short fiscal year by 12. 
(2)  In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the fund, and notwithstanding any other provision of the fund to the contrary, for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1994, the compensation of each member taken into account under the fund shall not exceed the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit. The OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is $150,000.00 as adjusted by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for increases in the cost of living in accordance with section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applied to any period, not exceeding 12 months, over which compensation is determined (the "determination period") beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. 
(3)  For fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1994, any reference in this fund to the limitation under section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code shall mean the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit set forth in this provision. 
(4)  If compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's benefits accruing in the current fiscal year, the compensation for that prior determination period is subject to the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit in effect for that prior determination period. For this purpose, for determination periods beginning before the first day of the first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 1994, the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is $150,000.00. 
(e)  Benefit limitations. 
(1)  Maximum annual benefit. 
a.  The maximum annual benefit payable to a member under this fund in any limitation year shall equal the lesser of: 
1.  $90,000.00; or 
2.  One hundred percent of the members' 415 compensation averaged over the three consecutive limitation years (or actual number of limitation years for members who have been employed for less than three consecutive limitation years) during which the member had the greatest aggregate 415 compensation from the town. 
b.  For purposes of applying the limitations of Internal Revenue Code section 415, the term "415 compensation" shall include the member's wages, salaries, fees for professional service and other amounts for personal services actually rendered in the course of employment with the town paid during the limitation year. The term "415 compensation" shall have the same meaning as under Treas. Reg. § 1.415-2(d), which regulation is specifically incorporated herein by reference. 415 compensation shall be limited to the limitation prescribed under section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
c.  For purposes of applying the limitations of Internal Revenue Code section 415, the limitation year shall be the fiscal year. 
d.  The dollar limitation under Internal Revenue Code section 415(b)(1)(A) stated in subsection (e)(1)a.1 of this section shall be adjusted annually as provided in Internal Revenue Code section 415(d) pursuant to the applicable regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. The adjusted limitation is effective as of January 1 of each calendar year and is applicable to "limitation years" ending with or within that calendar year. 
e.  The limitation stated in subsection (e)(1)a.2 of this section for members who have separated from service with a nonforfeitable right to a benefit shall be adjusted annually as provided in Internal Revenue Code section 415(d) pursuant to the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
f.  For the purpose of this section, all qualified defined benefit plans (whether terminated or not) ever maintained by the town shall be treated as one defined benefit plan, and all qualified defined contribution plans (whether terminated or not) ever maintained by the town shall be treated as one defined contribution plan. 
(2)  Adjustments to annual benefit and limitations. 
a.  If the annual benefit begins before age 62 years, then the $90,000.00 limitation shall be reduced in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe which is consistent with the reduction for old-age insurance benefits commencing before age 62 years. The reduction under this subsection (e)(2)a. shall not reduce the limitation of subsection (e)(1)a. of this section to $75,000.00 if the benefit begins at or after age 55 years, or if the benefit begins before age 55 years, the equivalent of the $75,000.00 limitation for age 55 years. 
b.  If the annual benefit begins after age 65 years, the $90,000.00 limitation shall be increased so that it is the actuarial equivalent of the $90,000.00 limitation at age 65 years. 
c.  For purposes of adjusting the annual benefit to a straight life annuity, the adjustment shall be the actuarial equivalent, utilizing the actuarial assumptions of the fund, except that the interest rate assumption shall be the greater of five percent or the rate otherwise used. 
d.  For purposes of adjusting the $90,000.00 limitation applicable after age 62 years, the adjustment shall be the actuarial equivalent, utilizing the actuarial assumptions of the fund, except that the interest rate assumption shall be the lesser of five percent or the rate otherwise used, and the mortality decrement shall be ignored to the extent that a forfeiture does not occur at death. 
e.  For purposes of this subsection (e), no adjustments under Internal Revenue Code section 415(d) shall be taken into account before the limitation year for which such adjustment first takes effect. 
f.  For purposes of subsection (e), no adjustment is required for qualified joint and survivor annuity benefits, preretirement death benefits and postretirement medical benefits. 
(3)  Annual benefit not in excess of $10,000.00. This fund may pay an annual benefit to any member in excess of his maximum annual benefit if the annual benefit derived from town contributions under this fund and all other defined benefit plans maintained by the town does not in aggregate exceed $10,000.00 for the limitation year or for any prior limitation year and the town has not at any time maintained a defined contribution plan in which the member participated. 
(4)  Participation or service reductions. If a member has less than ten years of participation in the fund at the time he begins to receive benefits under the fund, the limitations in subsections (e)(1)a.1. and 2 of this section shall be reduced by multiplying such limitations by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years of participation (or part thereof) in the fund and the denominator of which is ten; provided, however, that such fraction shall in no event be less than one tenth. The limitations of subsection (e)(3) of this section shall be reduced in the same manner except the preceding sentence shall be applied with respect to years of service with the town rather than years of participation in the fund. Additionally, to the extent provided in regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, the above-described reductions shall be applied separately with respect to each change in the benefit structure of the fund. 
(5)  Multiple fund reduction. 
a.  If a member is (or has been) a member in one or more defined benefit plans and one or more defined contribution plans maintained by the town, the sum of the defined benefit plan fraction and the defined contribution plan fraction for any limitation year may not exceed 1.0. 
b.  The defined benefit plan fraction for any limitation year is a fraction, the numerator of which is the projected annual benefit of the member under the fund (determined as of the close of the limitation year pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.415-7(b)(3)) and the denominator of which is the lesser of the product of 1.25 multiplied by the maximum dollar limitation provided under subsection (e)(1)a.1 for such limitation year, or the product of 1.4 multiplied by the amount which may be taken into account under subsection (e)(1)a.2 for such limitation year. 
c.  The defined contribution plan fraction for any limitation year is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the annual additions to the participants accounts at the close of the limitation year and the denominator of which is the sum of the lesser of the following amounts determined for such year and each prior year of service with the town: 
1.  The product of 1.25 multiplied by the dollar limitation in effect under Internal Revenue Code section 415(c)(1)(A) for such limitation year (determined without regard to Internal Revenue Code section 415(c)(6)); or 
2.  The product of 1.4 multiplied by the amount which may be taken into account under Internal Revenue Code section 415(c)(1)(B) for such limitation year. 
d.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the numerator of the defined contribution plan fraction shall be adjusted pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.415-7(d)(1) and questions T-6 and T-7 of Internal Revenue Service Notice 83-10. 
e.  For purposes of this section, the term "participant's account" shall mean the account established and maintained by the board for each member with respect to his total interest in the defined contribution plan maintained by the town resulting from annual additions. 
f.  For purposes of this section, the term "annual additions" shall mean any amount treated as an "annual addition" for the limitation year under Internal Revenue Code section 415(l)(1) and the regulations thereunder. 
g.  If the sum of the defined benefit plan fraction and the defined contribution plan fraction shall exceed 1.0 in any limitation year for any member in this fund, the board shall limit, to the extent necessary, the annual additions to such participant's account for such limitation year. If, after limiting the annual additions to such participant's account for the limitation year, the sum of the defined benefit plan fraction and the defined contribution plan fraction still exceed 1.0, the board shall then adjust the numerator of the defined benefit plan fraction so that the sum of both fractions shall not exceed 1.0 in any limitation year for such member. 
(6)  Incorporation by reference. Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, the limitations, adjustments and other requirements prescribed in this section shall at all times comply with the provisions of Internal Revenue Code section 415 and the regulations thereunder, the terms of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference.

APPENDIX B - TOWN OF DARIEN RULES OF PROCEDURE of the REPRESENTATIVE TOWN MEETING (RTM) 
[1] 
Part I-Purpose Of the Rules 
    The purpose of these rules is to provide a procedure for the orderly and efficient conduct of the meeting in a manner that will safeguard the traditional principles of representative government. These rules are adopted pursuant to Section 56(e) of the Act Consolidating Certain Special Acts concerning the Town of Darien (hereinafter referred to as the Act). 
Part II-Town Meeting Membership and Voting Rights 
    Part II-Sec. 1. The right to vote at town meetings of the Town of Darien, except meetings for the election of town officers, shall be limited to town meeting members elected as provided herein. 
    Part II-Sec. 2. At each municipal election, there shall be elected by ballot by each voting district the number of town meeting members to be elected therefrom in accordance with Part II-Sec 3. The provisions of the general statutes relating to elections shall apply to all elections of town meeting members, except as the same are inconsistent with the provisions of this act. No member shall be elected who does not receive at least twenty-five (25) votes of the electors of the district. If a tie vote in a district prevents the election of a town meeting member, the office shall stand vacated and be filled by appointment from among the candidates so tied by a vote of a majority of the town meeting members for said district, both newly elected members and those incumbents whose terms of office extend to the next municipal election. 
    Part II-Sec. 3. District Representation: The registrars of voters shall certify to the town clerk, not less than forty (40) days before a municipal election, the number of electors registered in each voting district on the sixtieth day before such election. Each district shall elect one (1) town meeting member for each one hundred (100) electors in such district, computed to the nearest one hundred (100), as established by said certification of the registrars; provided the total number of members shall be limited to one hundred (100) by apportioning members among the several voting districts so that the members from a given district shall be the same as the percentile figure, disregarding fractions, which, as of the sixtieth day before such election, the number of electors registered in that district bears to the total number of electors of all districts. However, if as the result of applying the foregoing procedure there is a deficiency in the permitted membership of one hundred (100), one (1) additional member shall be allowed to as many districts, selected in descending order of the magnitude of the fractions disregarded above, as is necessary to make up that deficiency. The number of town meeting members to be elected from each district shall be the number of replacements necessary because of expiring terms plus or minus the number of seats necessary to make the total membership from each district equal to its allotted representation. 
    Part II-Sec. 4. Terms of Office; no compensation: Terms of office of members elected to the RTM shall be two (2) years except as provided herein. In each voting district, the maximum number of two-year terms which may be filled at any election shall be a bare majority of the total allotted representation of that district. Others elected shall have one-year terms. Preference for two-year terms shall be given in descending order of the number of votes received. Town meeting members shall serve until their successors are elected and have qualified. They shall serve without compensation. 
    Part II-Sec. 5. Eligibility: No person shall be eligible for election or appointment as a town meeting member for any voting district who is not an elector of the town and a resident of such district at the time of the filing of his nominating petition or notice of re-nomination in accordance with section 6 of the Act or at the time of his appointment in accordance with section 7 of the Act. No town meeting member shall at the same time hold any other town elective office, or appointive town office as defined in sections 4 and 6 of the Charter, except as expressly permitted in other sections of the Charter or the Code of Ordinances or as provided by state law or where any additional office is advisory as authorized by section 18 of the Charter. If for any reason a town meeting member ceases to be a resident or an elector of the town, his office shall thereupon become vacant. A town meeting member may continue for the remainder of his term to represent the district electing him although his residence has been removed to another district of the town. 
    Part II-Sec. 6. Nominations and voting: 
(a)  Nomination of a candidate for a town meeting member shall be made by filing with the town clerk, between eight (8) and twelve (12) weeks prior to the election, a petition on a form provided by the town clerk, signed in ink by at least twenty-five (25) electors of the district in which the candidate resides and bearing the written acceptance of the candidate. A town meeting member may nominate himself for reelection from the same district by giving written notice to such effect to the town clerk at least ten (10) weeks before the election. Each such petition shall contain the name of only one (1) candidate. 
(b)  Except as otherwise provided by the general statutes, voting for members of the town meeting shall be by voting machine or by absentee ballot. The town clerk shall certify to the secretary of the state, in accordance with legal due dates, the number of candidates which each voting district may elect, and the names of the candidates nominated in each of said districts. There shall be no party name, symbol, or identification of town meeting candidates. An elector may vote for as many persons to be town meeting members as his district is entitled to elect.

PREAMBLE
Pursuant to the power and authority invested in it by law, the Planning and Zoning Commission of
the Town of Darien hereby adopts the following Regulations.
I. ARTICLE I - PURPOSES
SECTION 100. PURPOSES
There is hereby established a comprehensive zoning plan for the Town of Darien, Connecticut
(hereinafter referred to as the "Town"), which plan is set forth in the text, maps, and schedules,
which constitute these Regulations. Said plan is adopted for the purposes set forth in Chapter 124,
Section 8 of the Connecticut General Statutes, to:
a. Guide the future growth and development of the Town in accordance with the Town Plan of
Development which is designed to promote the most beneficial and convenient relationships
among the residential, commercial, and public areas within the Town, considering the
appropriateness of various uses in each area, and the suitability of each area for such uses, as
indicated by existing conditions and trends in development.
b. Provide adequate light, air and privacy; secure safety from fire, flood and other danger; and
prevent overcrowding of the land and undue concentration of population.
c. Protect the character and the historic, social and economic stability of all parts of the Town, and
ensure that all development shall be orderly and beneficial.
d. Protect and conserve the value of land throughout the Town and the value of buildings
appropriate to the various zones established by these Regulations.
e. Bring about the gradual conformity of the uses of land and buildings throughout the Town to the
comprehensive zoning plan set forth in these Regulations, and minimize conflicts among the
uses of the land and buildings.
f. Promote the most beneficial relation between the uses of land and buildings and the circulation
of traffic throughout the Town, having particular regard to the avoidance of congestion in the
streets and the provision of safe and convenient traffic access appropriate to the various uses of
land and buildings throughout the Town.
Page I-2
g. Aid in providing a guide for public policy and action in the efficient provision of public
facilities and services, and for private enterprise in building development, investment, and other
economic activity relating to uses of land and buildings throughout the Town.
h. Limit development to an amount commensurate with the availability and capacity of public
facilities and services, thereby facilitating adequate provision for transportation, water,
sewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements.
i. Conserve and protect all of the natural resources of the Town, including land, soil, air, water,
wetlands, marshes, ponds and lakes, streams and water courses, shorefront and coastal lands,
rivers and tidal estuaries, trees and vegetation, forests, aquifers and water tables, wildlife, areas
of scenic beauty, and areas of ecological importance - in recognition of the important
interrelationships among these resources and a suitable environment for human habitation, their
direct influence on the Town's suitability for residential use, and their importance to the health,
safety and general welfare of Darien and its larger environs.
j. Assure that proper provision be made for sedimentation control, and the control of erosion
caused by wind or water.
k. Improve the appearance of all parts of the community by requiring or encouraging as
appropriate, reasonable and necessary steps as part of the application of these Regulations.

III. ARTICLE III - GENERAL REGULATIONS
SECTION 300. APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS
301. Minimum Requirements
In interpreting and applying these Regulations, the requirements contained herein are
declared to be and shall be interpreted and applied to meet the minimum requirements for
the protection of the public health, morals, safety, comfort, convenience and general
welfare. In considering issues arising under these Regulations, the applicable ordinance,
statute, law, rule or regulation which imposes the most restrictive obligation upon the use of
and/or construction of buildings and structures and upon the use of land shall be applied to
the extent consistent with law.
302. Provisions Controlling
These Regulations shall not be deemed to interfere with, or abrogate, or annul, or otherwise
affect any easements, covenants, or other agreement between parties, provided, however,
that where these Regulations impose greater restrictions than are imposed by said
easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions of these Regulations shall prevail.
303. Regulations Affect Every Building and Use
Except as otherwise provided herein, no building shall be erected, moved, altered, rebuilt or
enlarged, nor shall any land, water area or building be used, designed, or arranged to be used
for any purpose except in conformity with these Regulations for the zone in which such
building, water area or land is located.
Page III-2
SECTION 310. GENERAL ZONE REGULATIONS
311. Zone Classifications
The Town of Darien is hereby divided into the following classes of zones:
R-2 One Family Residential Zone - 2 acre
R-1 One Family Residential Zone - 1 acre
R-1/2 One Family Residential Zone - 1/2 acre
R-1/3 One Family Residential Zone - 1/3 acre
R-1/5 One Family Residential Zone - 1/5 acre
R-NBD Noroton Bay District Residential Zone
DMR Designed Multi-Family Residential Zone
PR Parking - Residential Zone
3.7AH 3.7 Acre Hollow Tree Ridge Road Small Acreage Zone for
Affordable Housing
CBD Central Business District Zone
CBD-CS Central Business District Zone  Corbin Subarea
NH Noroton Heights Business Zone
DB Designed Business Zone
DC Designed Commercial Zone
NB Neighborhood Business Zone
SB Service Business Zone
DO Designed Office
LW Leroy-West Affordable Housing Overlay Zone
SN Special Needs Housing Overlay Zone
DBR Designed Business and Residential Overlay Zone
DCR Designed Community Residential Overlay Zone
MU Municipal Use Overlay Zone
[Amended 7/23/2006; 7/29/2007; 11/11/2007; 10/24/2010; 10/25/2012; 4/9/2017;
12/16/2018; 8/11/2019]
312. Zoning Map
Said zones are bounded and defined as shown on the map entitled "Town of Darien, Conn.
Zoning Map" which, with all explanatory matter thereon, is on file in the office of the
Commission and is hereby declared to be part of these Regulations.
Page III-3
313. Order of Restrictiveness
Where zones are referred to as more restrictive or less restrictive, the designation
shall refer to the order in which the zones are named above, the first being the most
restrictive. In the case of the single family residential zones, although the uses allowed in
all such zones are the same, it is clear that the R-2 zone is the most restrictive zone due to
required greater lot size, and yard requirements.
In zones other than single family residential, the uses permitted vary greatly, as do the lot
area, setback, coverage and other restrictions and requirements. Some aspects of one
zone may be more restrictive than another zone, but the other zone might be more
restrictive due to some other factors. To avoid future debate about which zone is more or
less restrictive, the order of restrictiveness is specified in Section 311.
[Amended 7/29/2007]
314. Location of Boundaries
Where uncertainty exists as to the locations of any boundaries shown on the zoning map, the
following rules shall apply:
a. Zone boundary lines are intended to follow Town boundaries, street lines, rights-ofway,
watercourses or lot lines, or be parallel or perpendicular thereto, unless such
zone boundary lines are fixed by dimensions, as shown on said zoning map.
b. Where zone boundaries are indicated as parallel to street lines, they shall be assumed
to be 100 feet distant therefrom, unless otherwise indicated.
c. Where two or more zoning designations are shown within a block 200 feet or less in
width, the boundary of the more restricted zone shall be deemed to be 100 feet back
from its street line.
d. In subdivided property, or where a zone boundary divides a lot, the location of any
such boundary, unless the same is indicated by dimensions shown on said map, shall
be determined by the use of the map scale shown thereon.
e. The zone classification of any water area within the Town inshore from the mean
low tide line on the effective date of this Section shall be deemed to be the same as
the classification of the adjoining land area, and the zone classification of any area
extending outward from the shore beyond the said mean low tide line shall be R-l.
f. If the zone classification of any part of the Town is in question, it shall be deemed to
be in the most restrictive adjoining zone.
315. Lots in More than One Zone
Where a lot in one ownership of record is divided by one or more zone boundary lines,
regulations for the less restricted portion or portions of such lot shall not extend into the
more restricted portion or portions.
Page III-4
SECTION 320. GENERAL USE REGULATIONS
321. Improvements Required as Condition of Use of Lot
321.1 Safe Access Required for Zoning Permit
No Zoning Permit shall be issued for any residence or other structure until safe and
completely adequate all-weather access to the site has been provided for the use of fire and
other emergency vehicles, and for essential service vehicles, from the nearest public street or
street intended as the means of access to the property.
For the purpose of this section, such safe and completely adequate all-weather access shall
mean and include only: (1) a completed paved roadway; or (2) a roadway under construction
which has been completed at least with respect to proper subgrade and proper subbase in
accordance with a plan approved by the Commission, which construction has been properly
installed and graded with all debris removed, has all required underground utilities installed,
and extends at least to the point of entrance to the lot.
321.2 Conservation Restrictions
The use of conservation restrictions may be required by the Commission to protect and
permanently preserve natural or unique features which enhance the character and
environment of the area, or that are necessary for the control of sedimentation and erosion.
Such restrictions shall take the form of negative easements and shall be finalized prior to any
commencement of construction.
321.3 Completion of Improvements Required for Certificate of Zoning Compliance
No Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be issued for any residence or other structure
intended for human occupancy or other use located on a lot which requires the construction
of a new roadway or utilities to serve it, as shown by any subdivision or site plan approved
by the Commission until the Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO) has determined that all
utilities, drainage and street improvements required to be installed to serve the lot have been
satisfactorily installed in accordance with the said plan, except for the following:
a. Final surface treatment (wearing surface) of the roadway and sidewalks.
b. Standard street signs.
c. Curbs and guard rails (as required).
d. Topsoil, seeding, trees and other required planting.
e. Such other minor installations as will not interfere with proper access and
drainage and are best deferred to final completion of all required construction
322. Accessory Uses
All accessory uses shall be located on the same lot with the principal uses to which they are
accessory, except as provided in Section 906.1. Accessory uses and/or structures shall not
be located, established or continued on a lot without the prior establishment of a permitted
principal use; nor shall any new lot be created that has an accessory use or structure without
a principal use.
Page III-5
323. Prohibited Uses
a. Any use not specifically permitted by these Regulations shall be prohibited.
b. Any use or activity that creates a nuisance, including, but not limited to, the emission
of gases, fumes, odor, dust, noise, glare, vibration, smoke, danger of fire, explosion,
radiation, or results in pollution of ground, air, or water, or other physical hazard
shall be prohibited.
Page III-6
SECTION 330. GENERAL LOT AND DIMENSION REGULATIONS
331. Lot Required for Every Building
Every building hereafter erected shall be located on a lot as herein defined. There shall be
not more than one main building and its accessory buildings on one lot, except for nonresidential
buildings and multi-family dwellings in zones where such uses are permitted.
332. Required Street Frontage
No permit shall be issued for any building unless the lot upon which such building is to be
built shall have the frontage required by these Regulations on a street as defined herein.
333. Yards and Open Space Can Apply to Only One Building
No yard or other open space provided about any building for the purpose of complying with
the provisions of these Regulations shall be included as any part of the yard or open space
for any other building; no yard or any other open space on one lot shall be considered as a
yard or open space for a building on any other lot. Should a lot hereafter be formed from a
part of a lot already occupied by a building, such separation shall be effected in such manner
as not to impair conformity with any of the requirements of these Regulations with respect
to the existing building and all yards and other required spaces in connection therewith, and
no permit shall be issued for the erection of a building on the new lot thus created unless it
complies with all the provisions of these Regulations. (See Subsection 222 for illustration.)
334. Lot Width and Depth Required
Within any zone, no part of any building or any structure housing a principal use shall be
erected on any part of a lot which has a minimum width or depth of less than the distance
specified for the zone in which located. Further, such lot shall be able to fully enclose a
square having a dimension on each side equal to the lot width requirement for that zone.
On existing non-conforming lots where there is no portion of the lot with sufficient lot width
and/or lot depth to fulfill these requirements, the following shall apply:
a. Construction of a new principal building on a vacant building lot shall be permitted
only in accordance with Subsection 385; and
b. The lot width and/or lot depth requirement shall not apply to the construction of a
replacement dwelling or to an addition to an existing structure provided the actual lot
width and actual lot depth shall equal at least 75 percent of that which is required.
[Amended 2/28/2016]
335. Lot Area Not Counted Toward Requirements
For any lot created by subdivision or other means subsequent to October 7, 1957, no part of
such lot less in width than one-half of the minimum lot width required for the zone in which
it is located shall be counted as part of the required lot area.
Page III-7
336. Lots Wholly or Partially Under Water
No more than 25 percent of the minimum area requirement of a lot may be fulfilled by land
which is under water or is subject to periodic flooding at mean high tide. Land which is
under water that is open to use by persons other than the owner of the lot shall be excluded
entirely from the computation of the minimum area of that lot.
337. Odd Shaped Lots
Where a question exists as to the proper application of any of the requirements of these
Regulations to a particular lot or parcel because of the peculiar or irregular shape of the lot
or parcel, the ZBA shall determine how such Regulations shall be applied.
338. Corner Lots
A building erected on a corner lot shall be required to have the two or more yards adjoining
the streets equal in depth to the required front yards on such streets. As defined, the lot line
opposite the shorter of the front lot lines shall be deemed a rear lot line and the remaining lot
line shall be a side lot line. (See Subsection 222 for illustration.)
339. Lots Having Frontage Less than the Minimum Width Specified
Rear lots may only be created within the One Family Residential - 2 acre and One Family
Residential - 1 acre Zoning Districts. The frontage requirement for a lot located in such a
position that it is to the rear of some other lot fronting on the same street and occupied or to
be occupied by a one-family dwelling may be reduced to twenty five (25) feet subject to
compliance with the following specific standards which shall be determined by the
Commission at a General Meeting:
a. No portion of the lot between the street line and the building site shall have a lesser
width than the frontage.
b. The grade and alignment of such narrow part of the lot shall be adequate for a
driveway that can permit safe and convenient access to the lot. All necessary
environmental or other approvals shall be secured in advance to establish that the
proposed access is functional.
c. The intersection of the proposed driveway with the street shall be safe in terms of
minimum sight lines, gradient, and related factors. Maximum grades of the
driveway shall not exceed ten (10) percent and the first thirty (30) feet from the edge
of the street pavement shall not exceed two (2) percent grade.
d. No rear lot shall be positioned behind another rear lot.
For any such lot created subsequent to March 4, 1960, the frontage of which lot is less than
the minimum width requirement for said lot as specified in these Regulations, the following
additional requirements shall be complied with:
e. The front yard and minimum depth for said lot shall not be measured from the street
line but from a line parallel to or concentric with the street line and the least distance
Page III-8
therefrom sufficient to make said lot width at that point equal to the minimum width
specified for the zone in which said lot is situated, provided that, when the point at
which said lot reaches the required minimum width is the same or a greater distance
from the street line than the setback specified, no additional setback shall be
required.
f. Where a dwelling or other structure is to be located on a lot in such a position that it
is to the rear of some other lot fronting on the same street, the minimum distance of
said dwelling or other structure on the rear lot from the nearest point of the front lot
shall be 50 feet greater than the depth of the required front yard specified in these
Regulations. (See Subsection 222 for illustration.)
g. All utility lines, including electric and telephone service, extending from the street
line of such lot to the building site of the lot shall be installed underground. In
approving the establishment of such lot, the Commission may specify the location of
utility lines, the grade and alignment of the access driveway, storm drainage
provisions, and may also require that any driveway extending from the street line to
the building site on the lot be screened from the rear yards of abutting lots, where it
finds the same to be necessary for public safety or for the protection of the
surrounding residential area.
Page III-9
SECTION 350. REGULATION OF BUILDING APPURTENANCES
351. Porches
Any porch, whether enclosed or unenclosed, shall be considered a part of the building in the
determination of the size of yard or amount of lot coverage. (See Subsection 223 for
illustration.) A roof over entrance doorways (which is no more than five feet wide, one
story, open on the sides with a simple roofline) shall not extend more than three feet into any
required yard.
[Amended 12/29/2013]
352. Projecting Architectural Features
The space in any required yard shall be open and unobstructed except for the ordinary
projection of the windowsills, cornices, eaves, and other architectural features, provided,
however, that such features shall not project more than twelve inches into any required yard.
353. Bay Windows
Bay windows, including their cornices and eaves, shall not project into any required yard
more than two feet, provided, however, that the sum of the lengths of any such projections
on any wall shall not exceed one-fourth the length of any said wall.
354. Stairs and Ramps
Entry stairs, fire escapes and access ramps for the handicapped (which are no more than
seven feet wide and have a landing of no more than 4 x 4) shall not extend more than three

Page III-10
SECTION 360. REGULATION OF OTHER IMPROVEMENTS ON THE LOT
361. Terraces
A paved terrace shall not be considered in determination of yard size or building coverage,
provided, however, that such terrace shall be unroofed and without walls, parapets, or other
forms of enclosure. (See Subsection 223 for illustration). Such terrace, however, may have
an open guard railing not over three feet high, and shall not project into any yard to a point
closer than eight feet from any lot line.
362. Walls and Fences
The yard requirements of these Regulations shall not be deemed to prohibit any fence or
wall, including any necessary retaining wall, provided that in any residence zone no fence or
wall shall exceed four feet in height in any required front yard, and six feet in height in any
required side and rear yard, measured above the finished grade, subject to limitation in
Subsection 363 and pertinent requirements of Article VIII. A special privacy fence up to
eight feet high may be erected on a portion of a residential property that is immediately
adjacent to a commercial zone and/or a property with an ongoing non-residential or Special
Permit use as permitted in Section 404 of the Darien Zoning Regulations. This fence may
be on either the residential property or the property with the ongoing non-residential or
Special Permit use.
[Amended 12/31/2000]
363. Visibility at Intersections
On a corner lot in any zone, except a business zone, no fence, wall, hedge or other structure,
or planting, more than three feet in height, shall be erected, placed or maintained within the
triangular area formed by the intersecting street lines and a straight line joining said street
lines at points which are 30 feet distant from the point of intersection, measured along said
street line. The height of three feet shall be measured above the road surface at the nearest
edge of the road. (See Subsection 221 for illustration.)
364. Swimming Pools
A swimming pool shall observe all the regulations affecting accessory buildings, but in no
case shall a swimming pool be located nearer than six feet to the side lot line or rear lot line.
The setbacks for swimming pools shall be measured from the edge of any deck or platform
structure adjacent to the pool or otherwise from the exterior lip of the pool to the nearest
property line. Where a swimming pool shall be located nearer than 25 feet to the side or
rear lot lines, there shall be installed and maintained a permanent solid fence or wall six feet
in height and of such design, location and construction that effective screening shall be
provided for the protection of adjacent property. No swimming pool shall be provided with
an above-ground-level deck or terrace unless such deck or terrace observes the required yard
spaces for a main building as provided by these Regulations. Non-deciduous shrubbery,
where located adjacent to a swimming pool and of sufficient compactness, density and
height to afford truly effective screening may, during the period of its effectiveness, be
substituted for the required fence or wall if approved by the ZEO as adequate for the
purpose of screening. Swimming pools in existence on the effective date of this
amendment, and which do not meet the requirements given above, shall be considered
Page III-11
legally non-conforming within the meaning of Section 383, and, therefore, may be
continued as provided by Subsection 384. All swimming pools shall comply with the State
Building Code.
365. Underground Shelters
{intentionally deleted}
[Amended 12/31/2000]
366. Recreation Facilities
Tennis courts, paddle tennis courts and similarly developed recreation facilities shall be
deemed to be accessory structures and shall comply with all yard, coverage and other
applicable regulations. (See Subsections 223 and 224 for illustrations.)
Page III-12
SECTION 370. OTHER GENERAL REGULATIONS
371. Height of Buildings or Structures
The height limitations of these Regulations shall not apply to church spires, belfries,
flagpoles, cupolas not used for human occupancy, chimneys, ventilators, solar panels,
skylights, water tanks, mechanical equipment or similar features not intended for human
occupancy. Necessary mechanical appurtenances usually carried above the roof level may
exceed the height limitation provided they shall be adequately screened from view from
nearby streets. All such features, however, shall be erected only to such height as is
necessary to accomplish the purpose they are intended to serve, and the total area covered by
such features shall not exceed 15% of the roof area or the area actually needed, whichever is
less.
[Amended 2/28/2016]
372. Exception for Existing Alignment of Buildings
If on one side of a street within a given block and within 150 feet of any lot there is
pronounced uniformity of alignment of the fronts of existing buildings and of the depths of
front yards greater than the depths specified in the Schedule of Regulations, a front yard
shall be required in connection with any new building which shall conform as nearly as
practicable with those existing on the adjacent lots, except that no building shall be required
to set back from the street a distance greater than 60 feet, provided the requirements of
Subsections 334 and 339 are complied with. If on one side of a street within a given block
and within 150 feet of any lot, there is a pronounced uniformity of alignment of the fronts of
existing buildings and of the depths of front yards less than the depths specified in these
Regulations, a front yard shall be permitted in conjunction with any new building which
shall conform as nearly as practicable with those existing on the adjacent lots.
373. Display or Storage of Materials
In all zones, the display, exhibition or storage of merchandise, materials or articles for sale
in the required front yard shall be prohibited and the storage of such materials behind the
building line shall be covered or screened from the street.
Page III-13
SECTION 380. NON-CONFORMING USES AND BUILDINGS
381. Continuing Existing Uses
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the lawfully permitted use of land or buildings
existing at the time of the adoption of these Regulations may be continued although such use
does not conform to the standards specified by these Regulations for the zone in which such
land or building is located. Said uses shall be deemed legally non-conforming uses.
382. Non-conforming Use of Land
Where no building is involved, the non-conforming use of land may be continued, provided,
however, that no such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor shall it be
extended to occupy a greater area of land than that occupied by such use at the time of the
adoption of these Regulations, nor shall any such non-conforming use be moved in whole or
in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel of land occupied by such non-conforming use
at the time of the adoption of these Regulations, provided, further, that if such nonconforming
use of land or any portion thereof, ceases for any reasons for any continuous
period of more than 60 days, or is changed to a conforming use, any future use of the land
shall be in conformity with the provisions of these Regulations. No non-conforming use of
land shall be changed to another non-conforming use.
383. Non-conforming Use of Buildings
a. A building or structure, the use of which does not conform to the use regulations for
the zone in which it is situated, shall not be enlarged or extended unless such
building or structure, including such enlargement or extension, shall be made to
conform to all regulations, including use, for the zone in which it is situated.
b. Such non-conforming building shall not be structurally altered to an extent greater
than 50 percent of its current fair market value unless such alterations are required
by law; provided, however, that such maintenance and repair work as is required to
keep a non-conforming building or structure in sound condition shall be permitted;
and provided further, subject to compliance with parking and Flood Damage
Prevention requirements, Building Code, Fire Safety Regulations, and with the
approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals, that any such non-conforming use may be
extended throughout any parts of the building which were manifestly arranged or
designed for such use at the time of the adoption of these Regulations. The current
fair market value shall be determined by the ZEO and the calculations used shall be
made a part of the permanent file on any permit issued. No non-conforming use of
land shall be enlarged.
c. A non-conforming use of a building may be changed only to a conforming use.
d. If any non-conforming use of a building or land shall be abandoned then any future
use of such building or land shall be in conformity with the standards specified by
these Regulations for the zone in which such building or land is located.
Abandonment of a non-conforming use shall include changing to a conforming use
or moving the building in or on which such use is conducted or maintained, for any
distance whatever, for any reason. It shall be a presumption of abandonment of a
Page III-14
non-conforming use if said use shall cease for any reason for a continuous period of
one year or more. A rebuttal of this presumption can be presented to the ZBA for a
determination whether the nonconformity has been abandoned.
e. If any building in which any non-conforming use is conducted or maintained shall
hereafter be removed, the subsequent use of the land on which such building was
located and the subsequent use of any building thereon shall be in conformity with
the standards specified by these Regulations for the zone in which such land or
building is located.
384. Non-Conformity, Other Than Use
A building that is conforming in use, but does not conform to the height, setback, yard, land
coverage or parking requirements of these Regulations shall not be considered to be nonconforming
within the meaning of Subsection 383 (nonconforming use). Any and all
additions to the building must comply with all current requirements of the zone in which the
site is located. No permit shall be issued that shall result in the increase of any nonconformity
in height, setback, yard space, land coverage or parking without an appropriate
variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals. No intensification of use nor increase of the
amount of building vertically, horizontally or otherwise, shall be based on the existing
noncomplying or nonconforming aspects of the structure.
[Amended 2/28/2016]
384.1. Non-conforming Building To Be Deemed Legally Non-Conforming
In accordance with the provisions of the General Statutes, when a building is so
situated on a lot that it violates these Regulations with respect to its relation to the
boundaries of the lot, and such building has been so situated for three years without
the institution of an action to enforce such regulations, such building shall be
deemed a legally non-conforming building in relation to such boundaries. Although
the building may become legally non-conforming with respect to its relationship to
the boundaries of the lot, it shall not become legally non-conforming with respect to
any other provisions of these Regulations. Use of land, structures or both, which
were not legally established prior to these Regulations or in conformance with these
Regulations, shall not become legally non-conforming by the passage of time.
384.2 Donation of Land for Parking Does Not Increase Non- Conformity
Where the full portion of a lot, lying to the rear of a Rear Building Line established
in the CBD Zone by the Commission, is given to and accepted by the Town for
permanent use as part of a public parking area, the balance of the lot and any
buildings thereon shall not be considered non-conforming as a result of any
reduction in lot area, lot dimensions, building setbacks or building coverage below
the minimum requirements when such reduction is caused by the Town's acceptance
of the land for parking purposes. (See Section 1057, Dedication of Public Parking
Areas.)
Page III-15
385. Building on Non-conforming Lots
A permit may be issued for the erection of a building on any building lot, recorded in the
Darien Land Records, that was made non-conforming with respect to area, frontage, lot
depth and/or lot width requirements, by the adoption of, or any amendment to, these
Regulations or the Zoning Map, provided the Zoning Enforcement Officer makes a written
finding that:
a. The owner of any such lot did not own sufficient adjoining land at the time of the
adoption of said Regulations (September 24, 1954) or said amendments to conform
therewith, or more nearly therewith, and
b. All yard and open space requirements of the Regulations are met, and
c. Adequate provision is made for protecting the general health, safety, and welfare and
providing adequate access, drainage facilities, and protection of the nearby
properties, and
d. The lot has not been used in conjunction with adjacent property to the extent that its
identity has merged with adjacent property in the same ownership. Uses or activities
that may cause the identity of a lot to be merged with adjacent properties include,
but are not limited to the following:
1. allowing two or more parcels to be assessed as one building lot, or
2. construction of a structure crossing the property line, or
3. location of an accessory structure (tool shed, pool, garage, etc.) on the
4. having utilities and/or services (electrical, telephone, sewer, water, septic system,
etc.) on or crossing the lot without having an easement or documented
distinction between the parcel being serviced and the lot in question, or
5. having a driveway, parking area, accessway or similar facility on or crossing the
lot without having an easement or documented distinction between the parcel
being serviced and the lot in question, or
6. planting and/or maintaining a garden, lawn, row of planted trees or shrubs,
fence, or similar improvement(s) on or encompassing the lot or portion of the lot,
or
7. other actions of the lot owner that indicate that they have treated the lot as a
portion of the adjoining property.
When the owner of two or more adjacent non-conforming lots abandons the
separate, non-conforming status of the lots by failing to comply with any of the
above standards, the non-conforming lots shall be eliminated and the parcels shall,
for purposes of these Regulations, be considered merged into one or more
conforming lots or a single more nearly conforming lot. This shall apply even if one
Page III-16
or more of the non-conforming lots has been developed. Once considered merged
the lots may not be sold, conveyed, altered, or otherwise used as separate lots.
386. Restoration of Damaged Buildings and Structures
a. If any building or structure legally non-conforming in use or otherwise, shall be
damaged by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of the then fair market
value thereof, no repairs or construction except such as are required for public health
and safety shall be made unless such use and every portion of such building or
structure shall be made to conform to all the standards of these Regulations for the
zone in which it is located.
b. If the damage to such building or structure shall be less than 50 percent of the then
fair market value, it may be restored and the non-conforming use or other legal nonconformity
continued, provided that the total cost of such restoration shall not
exceed 50 percent of the current fair market value of the building or structure at the
time of the damage, and further provided that such restoration shall be started within
a period of six months and shall be diligently prosecuted to completion.
c. No modification of location, buildings, structures, parking or other characteristics
shall be made unless it results in closer approach to conformity with the present
Regulations.
d. The restoration of the building or structure and related improvements, including that
work authorized as per subsection e. below, must be in accordance with all
appropriate current flood damage prevention, fire, building and safety codes.
e. For buildings or structures located within a non-residential zone, the current use of
which is permitted within that zone, the following provisions shall apply.
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a., in the event of a casualty causing
the destruction of all or damage to a part of a legally non-conforming building or
structure, said existing building or structure may be restored in its pre-existing
dimensions provided precise details of the size, shape, floor plan, specific type and
location of use(s) and other aspects of the building or structure and related
improvements shall be on file in the Darien Land Records or the permanent files of
the Commission prior to the occurrence of such casualty. Appropriate documents
for filing shall include:
1. the final development plans for the building and site approved by the
Commission and signed by the Chairman; or
2. a set of complete plans prepared by a Registered Land Surveyor or Architect
illustrating the details of the legally non-conforming building or structure as
established prior to required Commission review and approval procedures. No
such documents shall be filed until reviewed and approved by the Commission
or its staff as being accurate representations of existing conditions and legally
non-conforming status.
Page III-17
387. Existing Special Uses Deemed Conforming
Any use lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of these Regulations, or of any
amendment thereto, in the zone in which use is classified herein as one requiring a Special
Permit shall, without further action, be deemed to be a conforming use in such zone. Any
extension of, or addition to, such use shall meet all requirements of these Regulations.

SECTION 410. NOROTON BAY DISTRICT RESIDENTIAL ZONE (R-NBD)
411. Background and Purposes
The Noroton Bay District Residential Zone (R-NBD) is a collection of approximately 77
lots, many of which were created in accordance with a 1926 Map that was filed in the
Darien Land Records as Map #341. All of these properties are in the private association
known as The Noroton Bay Homeowners Association. There are other properties that are
within the immediate area of this district, which have a lot size of one acre or more, and
therefore, are not included in this District. Streets and storm drainage systems in the
neighborhood are privately owned and maintained. About twenty eight of the seventy
seven lots were originally created with a size of approximately eight-thousand to eightthousand
four hundred square feet, or a little more than one-sixth of an acre. Houses are
now constructed on a variety of lot sizes, including single lots consisting of about 8,000
to 8,400 square feet; double lots consisting of about 16,000 to 16,800 square feet; and
other varying sizes ranging up to the one plus acres owned by the Noroton Yacht Club.
From the time that zoning was first established in Darien in 1925 until 1946, the portion
of Noroton Bay generally outlined in this R-NBD zone was in the B Residence Zone,
allowing nine families per acre. This area was treated separately and distinctly from the
adjacent A or AA Residence Zones, which extended from Nearwater Lane/Brush
Island Road northward, and southward to Pratt Island and Nash Island. In 1946, this
distinct area of the Bay was rezoned to AAA, allowing one family per acre, i.e., oneacre
minimum lot size, thereby rezoning it to be the same as the adjacent areas to the
north and south. In 1957, the AAA zone was changed to R-1, which has been in
effect until this rezoning.
During the ensuing years from 1957, many variance applications were received for
proposed construction of additions to existing residences or replacement residences
because virtually none of the lots in this neighborhood complied with the one-acre
minimum lot size, lot width, or lot depth requirements of the R-1 Zone. None of the
structures complied fully with all of the building setback and yard requirements.
Enactment of Flood Damage Prevention Regulations has required many structures to be
elevated as substantial renovations or new construction was proposed. The Flood
Damage Prevention Regulations require that the lowest floor (including basement) be at
least one foot above the expected flood level. The flood level is generally one to three
feet above the existing ground level.
In late October 2012, a storm affected many houses in Noroton Bay, resulting in flood
damage to many of the residential structures and the Noroton Yacht Club. In December
2012, FEMA noted that new Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) would take effect in
mid-2013. This would result in most of Noroton Bay, which is now in the AE elevation
10 or AE elevation 11 zones to become AE elevation 14, thus requiring additional
elevation of any first floor finished space. This modified FEMA mapping affects almost
every house within this zoning district (some of the waterfront properties are currently in
the VE-14 flood zone and will not be impacted by the proposed new FIRM). Basements
are not permitted within the flood hazard zones. The Commission wants to encourage
property owners to comply with all of the flood damage prevention requirements.
Because of the unique nature of this zone, with relatively small lots and all structures
within a flood zone, which flood zone elevation is generally four feet or more higher than
Page IV-10
the adjacent streets, special provisions are included, exempting the first six inches of eave
and up to twenty square feet of stair landing/stoop overhangs from Building Coverage,
making it easier for property owners to elevate their house to meet applicable FEMA
standards.
In the Noroton Bay District zone: the properties and circumstances of this neighborhood
are extremely different from the other properties in the R-1 Zone both to the north and
south of this District; the neighborhood has a unique character; lot sizes within this area
of Noroton Bay vary dramatically, oftentimes with small lots adjacent to much larger
lots; and all of the properties are within the flood hazard zone. The purposes of the RNBD
Zone are: to create more practical and logical regulations that will allow for the
reasonable use of properties without the need for variances; and where possible, readaptation
of the houses in the neighborhood, while still protecting this neighborhoods
character and the other purposes outlined in Section 100 of the Darien Zoning
Regulations.
[Amended 4/14/2013]
412. Permitted Principal Uses
Permitted principal uses in this zone shall be the same as allowed in all other R-2, R-1, R-
1/2, R-1/3 and R-1/5 Zones, as noted in Section 402 of these Regulations.

SECTION 420. MUNICIPAL USE OVERLAY ZONE
[Added 3/12/2006; Amended 8/11/2019]
421. Background and Purposes
The Municipal Use Overlay Zone is an overlay zone which is intended to provide greater
flexibility for municipal uses or for uses that are generally conducted by or provided by
the Town of Darien to serve a public purpose. These uses frequently are a one of a kind
use in the Town  such as the Town Hall, the Public Works garage, the firefighting
training facility, the middle school, the high school, the Darien Library, the Senior
Center, the Darien Police station, the EMS headquarters and garage, while others have
more than one facility in the Town, but are dispersed in different areas of the community
 such as the three Fire Stations, the public elementary schools, public housing, as well as
buildings and facilities in the public parks and beaches. In a municipality that is more
than ninety-percent developed, it is nearly impossible to find undeveloped parcels for
municipal uses or uses serving a public purpose. The application of current regulations
frequently limits or precludes the expansion of existing uses to meet future growth
requirements. For example, in the residential zones, a 30 foot maximum building height
applies to most municipal and public use buildings including the Darien Town Hall, the
Darien Police Department, the Noroton and Noroton Heights the volunteer fire
departments, the volunteer EMS service and all public schools. Those uses located in the
commercial zones are subject to even more restrictive building height limitations of 25
feet or 28 feet. These requirements restrict necessary growth, encourage footprint sprawl,
increase building costs and decrease available open space. The intent of this Municipal
Use Overlay Zone is to permit flexibility in building height, parking and buffer
requirements primarily to permit vertical expansion in lieu of expansion of building and
structural footprints. Such flexibility shall be granted only where the Commission
determines the appropriateness of a particular location for the zone, and only after Special
Permit approval of the specific use and facility. Not all municipal existing or proposed
uses or properties will be appropriate for the Municipal Use Overlay Zone, but the
creation and placement of the MU zone provides for greater flexibility for the Town to
provide essential services to the community while still protecting the high quality of
development and character of the town and protecting the properties in proximity to
municipal facilities.
422. Principal Uses Requiring Special Permit
The following uses may be permitted subject to approval of a Special Permit in
accordance with Section 1000, and then a Zoning Permit in accordance with Subsection
1102 and the standards set forth below:
a. Municipal buildings, structures and uses (including facilities of the Darien Board of
Education).
b. Buildings, structures and uses that serve a public purpose, not including uses carried
on primarily for profit, that would normally be constructed by and or operated by the
municipality, but which are under the auspices of a quasi-municipal entity such as
the Darien Library Inc., or Post 53 EMS service, or one of the three privately
operated volunteer fire departments.
Page IV-14
423. Permitted Accessory Uses Requiring Special Permit
The following uses may be permitted subject to approval of a Special Permit in
accordance with Section 1000, and then a Zoning Permit in accordance with Subsection
1102 and the standards set forth below:
a. Signs in accordance with Section 920.
b. Any building or use customarily incidental to a permitted use and specifically
approved by the Commission.
c. Reasonable and appropriate off-street parking and loading facilities in accordance
with Section 900 as those requirements may be adjusted by the Commission in each
instance based upon a review of the specific location, design and circumstances of
the existing and/or proposed use.
d. Accessory food services, consisting of the sale of prepared food for consumption on
the premises by visitors and employees.
424. Area and Bulk Requirements
The following requirements shall be deemed to be the minimum or maximum
requirements in every instance of their application. Dimensions are in feet unless
otherwise indicated.
Minimum Lot Area none
Minimum Lot Frontage 50
Minimum Lot Width (at building location) 60
Minimum Lot Depth (at building location) 100
Minimum Front Yard 25

Section 210
-highest point of roof above average grade
2 and one half stories
30 feet
35 feet
Maximum Building Coverage 25% of the lot area
Notes:
a. Minimum side and/or rear yard(s) may be reduced to not less than 8 (eight) feet for
the proposed use where the underlying zone of the abutting property is located in the
same or less restrictive underlying zone as the proposed use, and the Commission
determines that the placement of the building and/or mechanical equipment such as
air conditioning units relative to the property line will not be detrimental to the
reasonable use and value of the adjacent property.
b. In addition, the Commission may authorize a basement or two floors below ground
level to be completely finished, habitable space without those areas being counted as
a story. Maximum building height as defined by Section 210 may be increased to
40 feet and/or 3 stories above ground and/or 45 feet (from the average grade to the
Page IV-15
highest point of the roof) provided, either: 1) all of the setbacks for the entire
building are increased to at least two times the minimum requirement; or 2) the
Commission finds that the unique use and design of the building combined with the
location of the site and the development plan will result in a project that will be
appropriate for the community and the site specific circumstances and will not be
detrimental to the reasonable use and values of the adjacent properties.
[Amended 6/19/2016; 8/11/2019]
425. Special Controls
a. Necessary lighting of parking areas shall be permitted, but there shall be no
unshaded/unshielded light sources and lights shall be so located that their beams are
not directed into neighboring residential lots or onto an adjacent street. Due to the
unique nature of the uses and the fact that many of the facilities will serve more than
one function or use, and because it is not unusual for such facilities to be the location
of special events, the number of onsite parking spaces shall be subject to a
determination by the Commission regarding the adequacy of such parking for most
activities and events to take place on the site.
b. Reasonable and appropriate parking setback requirements as specified in Section
906.6 shall be provided except as those requirements may be adjusted or eliminated
by the Commission in each instance based upon a review of the specific location,
design and circumstances of the proposed use.
c. Reasonable and appropriate landscaping, screening and buffering shall be provided
in accordance with Section 940, as those requirements may be adjusted or eliminated
by the Commission in each instance based upon a review of the specific location,
design and circumstances of the proposed use.
d. All uses shall be subject to Special Permit approval in accordance with Subsection
1000. In general the 25 foot minimum buffer from all property lines to all Special
Permit buildings, parking areas and other active use areas shall be maintained, but
the Commission may authorize the reduction or elimination of the buffer size in
certain specific circumstances where they determine that it would be impossible
and/or inappropriate to establish and/or maintain such buffers and the Commission
determines that the reduction of the buffer size will not have an unreasonable
detrimental impact upon the adjacent property or properties.
e. The Municipal Use (MU) Zone shall be applied as an overlay zone that keeps the
existing, underlying zone in place, and thus provides the property owner with an
option to use and develop the site in accordance with the regulations of the existing
zone or to utilize the flexibility of the MU zone. Any structures and/or facilities
developed in accordance with the Municipal Use Overlay Zone are for the specific
use as authorized and might not be easily adaptable for conversion to other uses once
the municipal use has been discontinued.

SECTION 430. ACTIVE SENIOR RESIDENTIAL OVERLAY ZONE
[Added 10/26/2014]
431. Background and Purposes
Housing for active senior empty nesters is an important element of residential
development within the Town. Such housing enables older residents to continue to reside
in Town by living in specially designed single-family residences. The Active Senior
Residential Overlay Zone allows the development of such dwellings, by permitting
increased density on larger parcels in the R-1 Zone, while preserving the single-family
residential character of the surrounding area. Increased density on larger lots, combined
with strict limitations on building coverage and height, provides opportunities for active
senior housing. Developments approved pursuant to this Section shall comply with the
requirements of the federal Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 3600-3620) and similar state
statutes (e.g., CGS 46a-64b, 46a-64c) that pertain to housing for persons sixty-two (62)
years of age and older.
432. Uses Requiring Special Permits
The following uses shall be permitted subject to approval of a Special Permit in
accordance with Section 1000 and the standards set forth below:
a. Housing for those age 62 and older shall be permitted by Special Permit only on
properties that meet all of the following criteria contained in this Section 430,
including Accessory uses allowed in the R-1 Zone.
433. Site RequirementsBasic Services
All development proposed under this Section shall give due consideration to proximity to
services such as public utilities, available forms of public transportation within the
community, shopping facilities, and access to major highways and commuter roads. An
analysis of the availability of such services shall be submitted as part of any application
to demonstrate that the requirements of this Subsection have been fulfilled. At a
minimum, the site must be:
a. in the R-1 Residence Zone;
b. of at least three acres in size; and
c. served by public water and public sanitary sewer of sufficient capacity to serve the
development.
434. Age Restriction
All dwellings allowed under this Section 430 shall be occupied only by persons age 62
years of age or older. Prior to the issuance of a Zoning Permit for commencement of
construction, a restrictive covenant or declaration identifying the location and unit
number and street address and current owner(s) (or occupants if a rental unit) of each
dwelling unit and describing the age restriction must be recorded on the Darien Land
Records. The deed restriction or declaration must be approved by the Planning and
Page IV-17
Zoning staff and Town Counsel prior to being recorded on the Darien Land Records, and
shall be binding upon all future use of the dwelling(s).
435. Area and Bulk Requirements
The following requirements shall be deemed to be the minimum or maximum
requirement in every instance of their application. Dimensions are in feet unless
otherwise indicated.
1. Minimum Lot Area 3 acres

14. Minimum Distance between Structures 20 feet
15. Maximum Finished Floor Area per Dwelling Unit
(see Note 1 and Section 438c)
3,000 square feet
16. Maximum Number of Dwelling Units (round down to
the nearest whole number. See Section 438e)
2 per acre
Notes:
a. The Regulations allow for the finishing of up to ½ of the basement. No attic space is
allowed to be finished at all. Any finished space in the basement does not count
towards the 3,000 square foot maximum in Item 15.
b. The definition of Developed Site Area set forth in Section 210 shall apply to
developments created under this Section.
c. Each elderly below market-rate housing unit required to be constructed or acquired
shall be at least 800 square feet in size, and the average size of all of the elderly
below market rate housing units associated with the development shall be equal to or
greater than 50% of the average size of the on-site market rate units within the
development. Each elderly below market-rate housing unit shall be no less than 800
square feet in size, and have no less than the average of the number of bedrooms in
the on-site market rate units, rounded down. See Section 438 regarding below
market rate housing units.
[Amended 6/19/2016]
Page IV-18
436. Special Controls
a. One common driveway shall serve all dwelling units and structures on the site,
provided that the Commission may require an additional means of access for
emergencies only.
b. No structures, swimming pools, or sports courts shall be located within the
minimum yard areas. Terraces at grade may be located at least 25 feet from property
boundaries, where the Commission finds that such terraces are adequately screened
to avoid negative impacts to abutting streets and residential properties. Power
transformers and similar public utility equipment serving only the development may
be located within required yards, where the Commission finds that such equipment
is adequately screened to avoid negative impacts to abutting streets and residential
properties.
[Amended 7/12/2015]
c. All required yards shall consist of natural or landscaped screening from abutting
properties and streets. The minimum 25 foot buffer requirements of Section 944
shall apply to this Special Permit use within the R-1 Zone.
d. Only single-family and two-family dwellings shall be permitted. No more than two
dwelling units shall be located within the same building.
e. On-site parking shall be provided in accordance with Section 904a.
f. Finished, occupied space shall be located only on up to two and one-half (2-1/2)
levels within a building (the first floor and second floor and a portion of the
basement), but not in an attic. Any attic shall remain unfinished and shall be used
only for mechanical equipment and/or for storage.
437. Conservation Area Requirement
Developments under this Section shall include an area of at least ten (10) percent of the
total lot area as conservation area, subject to a conservation easement recorded on the
Darien Land Records. The conservation easement area may include some or all of the
required buffer area as well as other portions of the site as may be appropriate. The
conservation easement document shall be approved by the Planning and Zoning staff and
Darien Town Counsel, and recorded on the Land Records prior to the issuance of Zoning
and Building Permits for construction of new structures on the development site.
438. Requirement for below-market rate units
a. A below market rate dwelling unit is one which is affordable to households with an
income equal to or less than 80 percent of the State Median Income for the State of
Connecticut. All below market rate units constructed (or acquired) and deedrestricted
under this Section shall comply with the age restrictions in Section 433.
b. To calculate the minimum number of elderly below market rate units required to be
constructed (or acquired) either on-site or off-site and deed-restricted, the following
shall apply:
Page IV-19
? Less than 5 market-rate elderly units: 0 elderly below market rate units
? 5-6 market-rate elderly units: 2 elderly below market rate units
? 7-9 market-rate elderly units: 3 elderly below market rate units
? 10-12 market-rate elderly units: 4 elderly below market rate units
One elderly below market rate unit shall be constructed (or acquired) and deedrestricted
for each three elderly market rate units thereafter. (Round any
fractional requirement for below market rate units up to the nearest whole
number).
c. Each elderly below market-rate housing unit required to be constructed or acquired
must comply with both of the following requirements: a) the average size of all the
below market-rate units shall be at least 50% of the average size of the on-site
market rate elderly units constructed; and b) each unit shall not be less than 800
square feet in size. Any on-site elderly below market rate housing unit shall have no
less than the average of the number of bedrooms in the on-site market rate units,
rounded down.
d. Section 580 (Inclusionary Zoning) provisions for incentives, density bonus, and for
requiring below market rate dwelling units are not applicable to the use of the Active
Senior Residential Overlay Zone, since this overlay zone has a separate below
market rate requirement.
e. The total number of units on-site (market rate and below market-rate) shall not
exceed a density of 2.0 per acre in the R-1 Zone. Any additional required below
market-rate units beyond that density must be constructed or acquired off-site.
[Amended 6/19/2010]
439. Program Administration
The administration of the below market rate unit(s) shall comply fully with Sections 586

allowing increased density on parcels in residential zones that are a minimum of 175
percent of the minimum lot area in the underlying zone, but not less than 0.875 acre.
Such developments shall be designed to be consistent with the residential character of the
surrounding area. All residential units in this overlay zone shall be restricted to persons
with intellectual disabilities (special needs) whose income qualifies them for affordable
housing.

or equal to the lesser of eighty (80) percent of the State Median Income.
2. Such persons have an intellectual disability, as defined in Section 1-1g of the
Connecticut General Statutes.
b. Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy (CO), a restrictive covenant or
declaration identifying the current owner(s) of each dwelling unit and describing the
restrictions must be recorded on the Darien Land Records. The deed restriction or

V. ARTICLE V - DESIGNED BUSINESS AND RESIDENTIAL
AND PARKING ZONES
SECTION 500. DESIGNED BUSINESS AND RESIDENTIAL ZONE (DBR)
501. Background and Purposes
This district is an overlay zone which, in addition to permitted uses and controls of the
underlying zone, also permits additional uses subject to special provisions and is
composed of the Designed Business (DB) Zone together with associated residentiallyzoned
areas as shown on the Town Zoning Map. The district is a transitional zone
between the Central Business District and the lower density residential districts on the
periphery of that center and provides for the construction of residential dwellings as an
alternative form of development to that which is still permitted in the DB Zone. The
public interest is to provide a desirable alternative to presently permitted commercial uses
within the DB portions of this zone, to provide a broader choice of housing types in
Darien, and to preserve the residential character of Darien. This zone permits the
establishment of multi-family housing units that will serve the housing needs of persons
who desire this form of housing with its associated conveniences and advantages, and
will also meet certain social needs and requirements within the community. In particular,
the DBR district is intended to provide a diverse range of housing alternatives with senior
and moderate income housing being specifically encouraged.
502. Site Required to be Served by Public Water and Public Sewerage Facilities
To qualify for development under these DBR regulations, a site shall be served by public
water and public sewerage facilities of sufficient capacity for the proposed development.
503. Principal Uses Requiring Special Permits
The following uses shall be permitted subject to approval of a Special Permit in
accordance with Section 1000 and the standards set forth below:

other paved areas, terraces and pedestrian sidewalks shall not exceed 50% of the site
area.
e. The average floor area of all dwelling units may be increased from 1200 square feet
to as much as an average of 1800 square feet provided the density and/or maximum
number of dwelling units is reduced by 30%, so that the size, number and bulk of the
buildings and related development is not increased due to the larger size of the units.
[Amended 12/31/2000; 6/30/2002]
505. Density
505.1 Modification
Significant wetlands and areas of steep slopes of 15 percent or greater grade may be
identified by the Commission and excluded from the gross land area computation.
The Commission may increase the maximum density and modify the coverage
requirements hereunder pursuant to Subsections 506.1 and 506.2.
Page V-3
505.2 Bedrooms
At least 30 percent of the total number of units shall be limited to one bedroom.

506. Density Incentive
506.1 Senior Housing Incentive
If the applicant agrees to limit occupancy of all dwelling units to families of which at
least one person is age 62 or over, then the Commission may permit the applicant to
develop a maximum density of 12 units and 18 bedrooms per gross acre. Title to the

506.2 Moderate Income Housing Incentive
Permitted density may be increased by not more than 40 percent if at least 40
percent of the additional density units are established as moderate income dwelling
units. This incentive is an alternative to and not in addition to the Senior Housing
Incentive above. The Commission may limit this increase in density where the
Commission determines that such may be necessary or appropriate because of the
specific characteristics of the individual site. The Commission may waive the
recreational requirement of Subsection 509.b where the Commission finds that such
waiver will encourage moderate income housing units. Additional criteria for
moderate income housing incentives are set forth in Subsection 513.

open space shall be provided on the site for each dwelling unit. All designated open
space areas shall be able to contain a circle with not less than a 20 foot diameter.
The land so set aside shall be properly monumented, graded, screened and
landscaped and may include recreation facilities suited to the needs of the residents.
Recreation areas shall be designed to prevent the emission of objectionable noise
and light onto abutting properties. At least 75 percent of the recreation area shall
have a grade less than five percent and the area shall be shown on the plan as well as
the nature and type of recreation and facilities to be provided.
b. The requirement of 600 square feet usable common open space per unit may be
reduced by an amount equal to the total of the terrace areas provided under
Subsection 509 divided by the total number of dwelling units on the site, and said
area can be included in the calculation of the 600 square feet of open space per unit
required hereby.

to and in accordance with applicable state laws and these Regulations.
515. Mixed Use Regulations
515.1 Background and Purposes
Properties within the DBR Zone may be developed with combinations of residential
and non-residential uses with the expressed intent of encouraging the construction of
multi-family housing. This form of development shall be referred to as "DBR
Mixed Use Development" and shall be permitted only subject to the terms and
conditions of these special regulations and after careful design review to ensure that
a harmonious relationship is established among the mixed uses and between the
mixed uses and the general environs of the site.
Page V-9
515.2 Permitted Uses
Non-residential uses which are deemed to be compatible with multi-family units and
which may be incorporated within a DBR Mixed Use Development shall be limited
to:
a. Business and professional offices.
b. Indoor recreation facilities.
c. Clubs or lodges.
d. Protected Town Landmarks.
515.3 General Standards and Requirements
a. In deciding whether to permit mixed use development, the Commission shall
find that the proposed uses are:
1. Appropriate to the site and compatible with surrounding properties and
development;
2. Designed to preserve any historically or architecturally significant
structures and significant environmental features on the site;
3. Properly designed to enhance and emphasize the residential portion of
the project;
4. Designed to minimize impacts upon any adjoining residential uses;
5. Designed to minimize traffic congestion;
6. Of an intensity and combination of uses appropriate to the site and
district pursuant to the requisite findings under Section 1000 of these
Regulations.
b. A DBR Mixed Use Development may include more than one lot and said
lots are not required to be under common ownership. However, no
structures shall encroach upon any lot line and all property owners shall
participate in the application and be a direct party to any Special Permit
which may be granted. Any future application to amend a Special Permit
granted hereunder shall be consistent with the entire mixed use site. Any
shared facilities, common usages or other such elements of the Special
Permit shall be established in perpetuity through irrevocable easements or
other appropriate procedures.
c. A DBR Mixed Use Development constituting a subdivision or resubdivision
as defined in the General Statutes, shall not be approved by the
Commission unless such subdivision or re-subdivision shall also have been
Page V-10
approved. Such subdivision or re-subdivision approval process shall precede
or be undertaken in conjunction with the DBR approval process.
515.4 Density
No business or professional office building or structure in any DBR Mixed Use
Development, as defined herein, shall exceed a floor area ratio (FAR) of 0.12. Any DBR
Mixed Use Development including both a professional or service commercial office
building or structure and multi-family dwellings shall not exceed a total FAR of 0.30
(0.12 for office and 0.18 for multi-family). In a DBR Mixed Use Development, any
incremental increase in floor area above the ordinary maximum allowable FAR for the
non-residential uses shall be for multi-family uses only. Previously existing indoor
recreation facilities, clubs or lodges, and protected Town Landmarks are not subject to a
specific FAR limitation due to their uniqueness, but the Commission may limit the
amount of non-residential or multi-family development on the site accordingly.
Otherwise, all requirements of Subsection 505 shall be applicable.
All regulations hereunder pertaining to density and intensity of development are
maximum levels of development and the Commission, in its discretion, may further
limit development to reflect site specific conditions.
515.5 Special Exceptions
Where the Commission makes positive findings under these standards and
regulations that a proposed DBR Mixed Use Development may be permitted, they
may also consider the granting of certain special exceptions which may permit
additional flexibility in the development of the site or result in an improved
development of the district. Wherever special exceptions are permitted, they shall
be set forth specifically on the plans and the Commission shall set forth such
exceptions in the record on the applications. These may include:
a. Coverage - The maximum building and total site coverage for both
commercial and residential uses may be increased by not more than 10
percent.
b. Open Space - The minimum open space requirement of 600 square feet of
usable open space for each dwelling unit may be decreased by the
Commission to no less than 400 square feet for each dwelling unit.
Otherwise, all requirements of Subsection 510 shall be applicable.
c. Parking - The minimum parking space requirements for a non-residential use
shall be complied with in full pursuant to Section 900. With regard to
residential parking space requirements, the one-half space per unit to be
designated for visitor parking may be provided on that portion of the site not
reserved for multi-family uses if established by easement. Otherwise, all
requirements of Section 900 shall be applicable to the residential
development parking requirements.
d. Setbacks - All setback requirements shall be applicable to a DBR Mixed Use

SECTION 520. DESIGNED MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL ZONE (DMR)
521. Background and Purposes
This district permits multi-family uses subject to special provisions. The district provides
for the construction of residential dwellings, the preservation of open space, and the general
enhancement of residential development of larger properties conveniently located with
respect to basic services within the community. The district is designed to be within
walking distance of the Noroton Heights Shopping Center and the Noroton Heights train
station in Darien. The zone is intended to provide a broader choice of housing types, to
address needs for affordable housing, and to preserve the residential character of Darien.
Multi-family housing within prescribed density limitations may only be constructed here,
where it will be in close proximity to commercial services and mass transportation facilities,
but, except for dwelling units of the Darien Housing Authority, it will not be adjacent to,
and in no case, shall the new units adversely impact existing or potential single family
residences. This zone is in close proximity to a commercial retail center and permits the
establishment of multi-family housing units that will serve the housing needs of persons
who desire this form of housing with its associated conveniences and advantages.
[Amended 3/29/2009]
522. Site Requirements

Page V-22
SECTION 540. 3.7 ACRE HOLLOW TREE RIDGE ROAD SMALL ACREAGE ZONE FOR
AFFORDABLE HOUSING
541. Background and Purposes
This Affordable Housing use is created in response to an application to amend the Zoning
Regulations to permit development of affordable housing on a 3.7 acre tract on the west
side of Hollow Tree Ridge Road. Affordable housing which fully satisfies the intent,
requirements and purposes of Section 8-30g of the Connecticut General Statutes must be
part of any housing proposal submitted for approval within this Zone. If the property is
not developed for affordable housing in accordance with the requirements of the stated
statutes, the district shall continue to be subject to all requirements of the Designed
Multi-family Residential Zone as set forth in Section 520 of the Regulations. The district
requirements recognize the location of the property which is separated from single-family
residential neighborhoods by the railroad tracks to the north, the John Davis Lodge
Turnpike (Interstate 95) to the south, Hollow Tree Ridge Road and the commuter parking
lot to the east, and to the west, a large undeveloped tract of land which is in the DMR
Zone. The isolated location of the site limits density of development to preserve the
health and safety aspects of the community. The district is close to the Noroton Heights
Shopping Center, the Stop and Shop shopping center, the Noroton Heights Train Station
and not far from the Middlesex Middle School. Development in accordance with these
Regulations will provide a broader choice of housing types to address the needs for
affordable housing while still preserving the predominant single family residential
character of Darien. Such multi-family affordable housing under Section 8-30g of the
Connecticut General Statutes may only be constructed here, where it will be in close
proximity to commercial services and mass transportation facilities, and will not be
adjacent to or adversely impact existing or potential single-family residences. These
multi-family housing units will serve the needs of persons who desire this form of
housing with its associated conveniences and advantages, and it is acknowledged that onsite
open space and other amenities must be provided due to the somewhat isolated nature
of this property. On-site parking must be sufficient to serve the needs of residents,
service persons, and visitors because no on-street parking is likely to become available in
the area.
541b. Background and Purposes  Self Storage
This Self-Storage use is created in response to an application to amend the Zoning
Regulations to permit the development of a self-storage facility on the 3.7 acre tract on
the west side of Hollow Tree Ridge Road. If the property is not developed for affordable
housing per the above or self-storage, the district shall continue to be subject to all
requirements of the Designed Multi-Family Residential Zone as set forth in Section 520
of the Regulations. The district requirements recognize the location of the property which
is separated from single-family residential neighborhoods by the railroad tracks to the
north. the John Davis Lodge Turnpike (Interstate 95) to the south, Hollow Tree Ridge
Road and the commuter parking lot to the east, and to the west a large multi-family
residential development (Avalon). The lack of access to public sewage facilities limits
development options for the 3.7 acre tract. The district is close to the Noroton Heights
Shopping Center, the Stop and Shop shopping center, the Noroton Heights train station,
the Avalon residences and not far from Middlesex Middle School. Development in
accordance with these regulations will provide storage options to residential homeowners
Page V-23
in Darien. Such self storage facility may only be constructed here, where it will be in
close proximity to other commercial uses and mass transportation facilities and will not
adversely affect existing or potential single-family residences. This self-storage facility
will serve the needs of residents who desire, or are in need of, additional storage for
business, personal and household goods, as well as cars and boats, and parking must be
provided because of the somewhat isolated nature of this property.
[Amended 4/17/2016]
542. Site Requirements  Affordable Housing
a. Utilities
The site is adjacent to existing water and public sewage facilities which appear to be
of sufficient capacity to serve potential development of the property. Upgrading,
improvement or extension of the facilities may be necessary due to the density. The
costs associated with upgrading such facilities shall be borne by the applicant in
connection with any proposed development activity. The applicant shall submit a
statement from a licensed professional engineer and/or the utility companies
certifying that the capacity of the utilities will suffice to accommodate the proposed
development and/or will be upgraded to accommodate such development.
b. Environmental Impacts
An environmental impact study and analysis shall be prepared and submitted to the
Commission as part of any application and must clearly illustrate all effects of
proposed development upon environmental factors, including but not limited to,
inland wetlands and watercourses, aquifers, trees and vegetation, storm drainage
systems, potential soil erosion, and other such elements. Such studies shall prescribe
proposed measures to mitigate environmental damage while still accomplishing the
basic objectives of the proposed development. The applicant shall also be
responsible for certifying to the Commission that the air and noise conditions
existing due to surrounding uses have been taken into consideration in the design of
the project and that such conditions will not adversely affect or impact the health,
safety and comfort of the residents of the premises.
c. Vehicular Traffic
A current traffic impact study shall be prepared and submitted to the Commission so
as to meet the requirements of Subsection 1005(d) and (e) of these Regulations with
regard to the existing and proposed conditions and circumstances as well as
reasonably anticipated traffic elements such as road and drive width, sight lines,
current and projected volumes of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, a second means of
vehicular access/egress to and from the property for emergency purposes, circulation
patterns, curb cut locations, on site parking needs, service vehicle access and
maneuvering, trip generation, traffic control devices, signals and signage, pedestrian
walkways, sidewalks, handicapped access and convenience and safety requirements
including impacts upon the surrounding street system. The costs associated with
upgrading or installation of traffic management devices or designs in connection
with the proposed development shall be borne by the applicant.
Page V-24
d. Basic Services and Utility Connections
All structures and dwelling units within the site must be serviced by public water
and public sewerage. All utility connections, including electrical, telephone,
telecommunications and other connections must be underground. No overhead
services or wires shall be permitted.
[Amended 4/17/2016]
542b. Site Requirements  Self Storage
a. Utilities
The site is adjacent to an existing water facility which appears to be of sufficient
capacity to serve potential development of the property. Upgrading, improvement or
extension of the facility may be necessary. The installation of a private septic system
will also be necessary. The costs associated with upgrading such facility shall be
borne by the applicant in connection with any proposed development activity. The
applicant shall submit a statement from a licensed professional engineer and/or the
utility companies certifying that the capacity of the utilities will suffice to
accommodate the proposed development and/or will be upgraded or installed to
accommodate such development.
b. Environmental Impacts
An environmental impact study and analysis shall be prepared and submitted to the
Commission as part of any application and must clearly illustrate all effects of
proposed development upon environmental factors, including but not limited to,
inland wetlands and watercourses, aquifers, trees and vegetation, storm drainage
systems, potential soil erosion, and other such elements. Such studies shall prescribe
proposed measures to mitigate environmental damage while still accomplishing the
basic objectives of the proposed development. The applicant shall also be
responsible for certifying to the Commission that the air and noise conditions
existing due to surrounding uses have been taken into consideration in the design of
the project and that such conditions will not adversely affect or impact the health,
safety and comfort of the residents of the premises.
c. Vehicular Traffic
A current traffic impact study shall be prepared and submitted to the Commission
with regard to the existing and proposed conditions and circumstances as well as
reasonably anticipated traffic elements such as road and drive width, sight lines,
current and projected volumes of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, a second means of
vehicular access/egress to and from the property for emergency purposes, circulation
patterns, curb cut locations, onsite parking needs, service vehicle access and

SECTION 580. INCLUSIONARY ZONING
[Added 5/31/2009]
581. Background and Purposes
These regulations are intended to encourage the development of below market rate
dwelling units within the Town of Darien, consistent with Section 8-2(i) of the General
Statutes of Connecticut.
582. Applicability
Inclusionary Zoning Regulations shall apply to all zones that allow dwelling units as a
principal or special permit use.
583. Affordable Requirements
Developments resulting in the creation of additional multi-family dwelling units shall
designate a minimum of twelve percent (12%) of the total number of dwelling units as
affordable housing as defined by Connecticut General Statutes. For the purpose of this
regulation, the term multi-family is defined as a single property with two or more
dwelling units, whether attached or detached. Dwelling units constructed pursuant to
Section 405e. are exempt from the requirements of this regulation.
Single-family subdivisions or re-subdivisions resulting in a total of five or more building
lots shall designate a minimum of twelve percent (12%) of the total number of dwelling
units as affordable housing as defined by Connecticut General Statutes. All other single
family subdivisions are exempt from the requirements of this regulation.
The affordable housing requirement shall be satisfied by: providing affordable housing
units on the subject property; providing affordable housing units elsewhere within the
Town of Darien; or paying a fee in lieu; or providing some combination thereof.
All affordable housing units shall be affordable to households with an income equal to or
less than 80 percent of the State Median Income (SMI) for the State of Connecticut
Household incomes are published by the United States Census Bureau and periodically
updated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Income
levels are to be adjusted for household size per HUD requirements.
[Amended 2/28/2016]
584. Below Market Rate Dwelling Unit
A below market rate (BMR) dwelling unit is defined as a dwelling unit occupied by an
income-eligible household as described in the Section 583 where the maximum sales
price or rent shall be restricted for forty years or the life of the unit, whichever is longer,
using the methodology for maximum housing payment calculations outlined in Section 8-
30g-8 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.
Page V-38
585. Incentives
Developments subject to the provisions of Section 580, except for single-family
subdivisions, may, at the absolute discretion of the Commission, be eligible for an
increase in permitted density up to 50 percent greater than the allowed density provided
at least 25 percent of such incentive units are designated as below market rate and the
Commission determines that such incentives do not adversely affect the health, safety and
welfare of the public in general, and the immediate neighborhood. In such cases, the
Commission may, at the absolute discretion of the Commission, allow any or all of the
following waivers, provided the Commission finds that such waiver encourages the
development of below market rate housing and is consistent with the surrounding
neighborhood:
a. Recreational or open space requirements may be reduced.
b. Minimum yard requirements may be reduced.
c. Maximum building coverage requirements may be increased.
d. Parking requirements may be reduced.
e. Height may be increased to allow three stories.
f. Height may be increased to allow up a maximum building height of 32.5 feet by
Special Permit.
In no case shall the Commission approve a waiver described in a. through e. above,
resulting in a requirement that deviates by more than 25% from the originating
regulation. On lots less than 0.6 acres in area in the Designed Business Zone (DB), the
Commission may increase building coverage by up to 50 percent from the originating
regulation, provided that the Commission shall find that the height and bulk of the
proposed buildings on the subject site shall not adversely impact abutting residential
properties.
[Amended 12/18/2011; 7/15/2012; 2/28/2016]
586. Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan
The applicant shall submit an affirmative fair housing marketing plan for the below
market rate dwelling units. All dwelling units shall be offered for sale or rent in
compliance with all applicable Federal and State Fair Housing laws.
[Replaced 11/28/2010]
587. Program Administration
Prior to the issuance of any Certificate of Occupancy, any application under Section 580
shall identify the non-profit entity or property manager who will be responsible for
program administration. The program administrator is subject to the approval of the
Commission or its designated representative. The program administrator shall:
a. Annually review and certify to the Commission the annual income of households
residing in below market rate dwelling units in accordance with a procedure
established in advance and approved by the Commission.
b. Maintain a list of eligible households in each category, as described in Section
586, who have applied for participation in the program. Applicants within each
Page V-39
category shall be selected by lottery, conducted in accordance with a procedure
established in advance of said lottery and approved by the Commission, or its
designated representative.
c. Annually certify to the Commission that the selected household actually resides in
the below market rate dwelling unit.
d. Certify to the Commission that below market rate dwelling units sold or re-sold
do not exceed the maximum purchase price as calculated in a manner consistent
with the methodology for maximum housing payment calculations in set-aside
developments outlined in Section 8-30g-8 of the Regulations of Connecticut State
Agencies, as adjusted for family size.
e. Certify to the Commission that below market rate dwelling units for rent shall not
exceed the maximum monthly rent as calculated in a manner consistent with the
methodology for maximum housing payment calculations in set-aside
developments outlined in Section 8-30g-8 of the Regulations of Connecticut State
Agencies, as adjusted for family size.
588. Additional Standards
a. On-Site: Affordable units shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the
development and shall contain, on average, the same number of bedrooms and
shall be indistinguishable from market rate units with respect to the exterior
finishes, including landscaping, but interiors may include standard finishes and
need not be of luxury quality. Those units shall be designed and located to
maintain the architectural elements and character of the neighborhood. Examples
of how to calculate the number of units required are shown in Appendix E of the
Zoning Regulations.
b. Phasing: Affordable units shall be developed simultaneously with or prior to the
development of the other units on a pro rata basis.
c. Deed Restrictions: In order to maintain affordable dwelling units for at least forty
years or the life of the unit, whichever is longer, the following restrictions shall
apply:
1. Affordable units for sale shall be restricted by title to require that, in the event of
any resale by the owner or any successor, the resale price shall not exceed the
then maximum sales price for said dwelling unit, as determined in accordance
with Subsection 587d above or the sum of the original purchase price and the
cost of any documented fixed improvements made by the owner, whichever is
greater.
2. Affordable units for rent shall be restricted by title to require that the rents for
said units shall not exceed the maximum rent as determined annually in
accordance with Subsection 587e above.
d. Alternative Sites: The Commission may, at its absolute discretion, approve the
construction or rehabilitation of the required affordable units on another site in
Darien, provided that such off-site affordable units shall be maintained for at least
Page V-40
forty years or the life of the unit, whichever is longer, in the same manner as onsite
units. The Commission may condition the issuance of certificates of
occupancy for the development project with the completion of the off-site
affordable units or establish other reasonable performance conditions necessary to
insure that the off-site units will be built in a timely manner.
e. Payment of a Fee: The Commission, at its absolute discretion, may require the
applicant to pay a fee in lieu of constructing some, or all, of the required
affordable housing units. Such fee shall take the form of a onetime cash
contribution to a Town of Darien housing trust fund, or other Commission
approved non-profit or for-profit organization dedicated to affordable housing
initiatives. Said funds shall be paid prior to the issuance of the first Zoning
Permit. Units created with such funds shall be designated as affordable in the
same manner as required in Section 584. An example of Fee In Lieu Payment
Calculations is in Appendix E.
f. Where the contribution is targeted to assist an identified off-site project providing
below market rate dwelling units, the Commission may, at its absolute discretion,
condition the issuance of certificates of occupancy for the development project
with the completion of the off-site below market rate dwelling units or establish
other reasonable performance conditions necessary to insure that the off-site units
will be built in a timely manner.
[Amended 2/28/2016]
589. Inclusionary Zoning
The provisions of Section 580 shall apply to Larger Developments within the Corbin
Subarea, subject to the following:
a. The incentives and waivers set forth in section 585 shall not apply to Larger
Developments within the Corbin Subarea.
b. The Commission may approve affordable housing units that are subject to
additional occupancy restrictions based on age or disabilities, provided that such
additional restrictions comply with all applicable housing laws. Each affordable
housing unit that is subject to multiple restrictions shall be counted as a single unit
for compliance with Section 583.

SECTION 720. CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT ZONE (CBD)
[Added/Amended 8/11/2019]
721. Background and Purposes
The Central Business District Zone is the Town's primary business area and is intended to be
the focal point for retail and business and professional office activities with apartments
encouraged on upper floors. These Regulations are designed to encourage the orderly
development of this district in a manner which encourages the preservation of the existing
architectural character of this zone and, at the same time, to provide the opportunity for
creative and flexible architectural design. The sound inter-relationship of buildings to plazas
and open spaces, provisions for proper pedestrian and vehicular circulation and consolidated
central parking areas, and encouragement of a mix of housing and business uses which are
necessary and desirable to serve the needs of the residential community are also specifically
addressed in these Regulations. These Regulations are designed for Commercial Sales and
Service uses (except for certain Financial Service uses) on the first floor areas and to provide
sufficient spaces for Business and Professional Offices and encourage Dwelling Units in
second floor spaces. The intent is to strengthen the viability of housing and retail business
in the Central Business District and to foster pedestrian activity as fully as is practical and to
enhance the walkability of the Central Business District.

SECTION 730. CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT  CORBIN SUB-AREA ZONE (CBD-CS)
[Added 4/9/2017; Added/Amended 8/11/2019]
731. Background and Purposes
The Central Business District Zone is the Town's primary business area and is intended
to be the focal point for retail and business and professional office activities with
apartments encouraged on upper floors. These Regulations are designed to encourage the
orderly development of this district in a manner which encourages the preservation of the
existing architectural character of this zone and, at the same time, to provide the
opportunity for creative and flexible architectural design. The sound inter-relationship of
buildings to plazas and open spaces, provisions for proper pedestrian and vehicular
circulation and consolidated central parking areas, and encouragement of a mix of housing
and business uses which are necessary and desirable to serve the needs of the residential
community are also specifically addressed in these Regulations. These Regulations are
designed for Commercial Sales and Service uses (except for Financial Service uses) on
the first floor areas and to provide sufficient spaces for Business and Professional Offices
and encourage Dwelling Units in upper floor spaces. The intent is to strengthen the
viability of housing and retail business in the Central Business District and to foster
pedestrian activity as fully as is practical.
The area within the Central Business District and adjacent to the Interstate 95
(Connecticut Turnpike) right-of-way presents a unique opportunity for redevelopment on
a larger scale, and in a manner that utilizes the proximity of the Interstate 95 (Connecticut
Turnpike) right-of-way and entrances and exits at the Boston Post Road. The width of
that right-of-way serves as a buffer to minimize the impact of larger structures from the
residential zone to the south of the right-of-way. The Corbin Subarea also presents an
opportunity to distribute traffic through the use of on-site streets and on-site parking.
Accordingly, the Corbin Subarea regulations encourage comprehensive, mixed-use
developments, with public greens and plazas, landscaped pedestrian plazas, public
amenities, internal streets and off-street parking facilities sufficient to meet the parking
requirements of a larger redevelopment. The Corbin Subarea regulations provide
developers with an option to build larger projects under the subarea regulations, or
projects under the CBD regulations.
732. Permitted Principal Uses
The following uses shall be permitted subject to approval of a Zoning Permit in
accordance with Subsection 1102:

SECTION 740. NOROTON HEIGHTS BUSINESS ZONE (NH)
[Added 10/24/2010; Added/Amended 8/11/2019]
741. Background and Purposes
The Noroton Heights Business Zone is intended to maintain the existing retail foundation
of the Noroton Heights business area while encouraging the development of business and
professional offices and dwelling units, including affordable units, in a pedestrian
friendly and transit-oriented area, in recognition of the zones proximity to mass transit
and Interstate 95. These regulations are intended to encourage development that promotes
safe pedestrian access to businesses by residents within the zone and from adjacent
residential neighborhoods. At the sole discretion of the Commission, increased building
height may be permitted to encourage the use of architectural design features such as
peaked roofs and dormers to soften the appearance from adjacent residential properties.
The intent is to strengthen the viability of retail business in the Noroton Heights
commercial district, to offer a broader range of housing and office space with convenient
access to transportation, to foster pedestrian activity as fully as is practicable, and to
reduce reliance on individual motor vehicles to access the retail businesses.
New development within this zone shall require Special Permits in order to establish a
pedestrian friendly mixed-use and transit-oriented area. It is imperative that new
development properly manage and enhance stormwater management in this overlay
zone. No development or redevelopment will be permitted if it will result in increased
adverse stormwater impacts on adjacent properties or adjacent streets. Any development
or redevelopment must address drainage, parking, traffic and pedestrian safety issues in
the area.

SECTION 820. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
821. Background and Purposes
These regulations have been prepared by the Town pursuant to Title 44, Chapter 1, Sections 59-75
of the Federal Register and the National Flood Insurance Program as amended.
It is the finding of the Commission and the Environmental Protection Commission that the flood
hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation which may result or might possibly result in loss of
life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of tax base, all of
which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in flood plains causing
increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses
vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise protected from flood damages.
It is, therefore, the purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens of Darien by making
provisions for the preservation, protection, maintenance, or use of flood hazard and floodway
areas.
Pursuant to the authority granted, the Commission shall grant, grant with modifications, or deny
permits for all regulated activities associated with these regulations within the Town.
822. Inventory of Regulated Areas
a. Regulated areas are identified as special flood hazard areas by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for
Fairfield County, Connecticut, dated July 8, 2013, with accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), dated July 8, 2013 (Panels 09001C0517G,
09001C0528G, 09001C0529G, 09001C0536G, 09001C0537G) and June 18, 2010
(Panels 09001C0507F, 09001C0509F, 09001C0526F, 09001C0527F), and other
supporting data applicable to the Town of Darien, and any subsequent revisions
thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this regulation. Since
mapping is legally adopted by reference into this regulation it must take precedence
when more restrictive until such time as a map amendment or map revision is
obtained from FEMA. The area of special flood hazard includes any area shown on
the FIRM as Zones A, AE, and VE, including areas designated as a floodway on a
FIRM. Zone VE is also identified as a Coastal High Hazard Area. The
determination of flood hazard areas shall be based on the flood elevations shown on
the FIRM maps in conjunction with an up-to-date and accurate topographical survey
of the property. Areas of special flood hazard are determined utilizing the base flood
elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
for a community. BFEs provided on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) are only
approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs published
in the FIS for a specific location.

b. The Commission and/or its designated agent shall monitor and maintain general
surveillance of the regulated areas within the Town to ensure that no unauthorized
regulated activities occur.
c. The Commission shall periodically, in conjunction with the Environmental
Protection Commission and state or federal agencies, inventory flood-prone and
flood-regulated erosion-prone areas and update the official map delineating said
areas to be regulated.
823. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by these Regulations is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on legal, scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods
can and will occur on rare occasions. Flooding heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes. It is not implied that land outside the areas of special flood hazards, or uses within such
areas, shall be free from flooding or flood damage. These Regulations shall not create liability on
the part of the Town or by any official or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these Regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
824. Permitted Operations and Uses
a. The following operations and uses shall be permitted in flood-prone and floodrelated
erosion-prone areas, as of right:
b. Uses incidental to the enjoyment and maintenance of a residential property such as
landscaping without substantial alteration of the real estate, but not including any
form of structure.
c. The following operations and uses shall be permitted as non-regulated uses in floodprone
and flood-related erosion-prone areas, provided they shall not disturb the
natural and indigenous character of the land:
1. Conservation of soil and vegetation;
2. Outdoor recreation such as play and sporting areas, picnicking, field trails, nature
study and horseback riding where otherwise legally permitted and regulated.
825. Permitting of Regulated Activities within Regulated Areas
a. No person shall henceforth conduct a regulated activity in a regulated area of the
Town without first obtaining a permit for such activity from the Commission. Any
regulated activity or use legally existing as of the effective date of these regulations
shall be exempt therefrom and permitted to continue provided that no new or
additional regulated activity, requiring a permit under these Regulations, shall be
conducted after this same effective date without such a permit. Lands to which these
Regulations apply are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
b. Any application to the Commission for a Zoning Permit, Site Plan Approval, Coastal
Site Plan Review or subdivision approval shall be reviewed by the Planning and
Page VIII-5
Zoning Director to determine if it involves any activity or work within a regulated
area, and if so, shall incorporate the requirements of these Regulations in the
application.
c. Any application to the Building Department for a Building Permit or other permit
shall be reviewed by the Building Official to determine if it involves any activity or
work within a regulated area, and if so, the applicant shall be referred to the
Commission for its approval prior to issuing said permit. All such action shall be
properly recorded within the application file.
d. In all areas of special flood hazard and Coastal High Hazard areas (for all
unnumbered and numbered A and V zones and A, AE, and/or VE zones), the
following provisions shall apply:
1. Permits shall be required for all new construction, substantial improvements
(including the placement of prefabricated buildings and manufactured homes)
and other development and shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent floatation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and
be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage
and shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other
service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
Such design shall be by a Connecticut Registered Professional Engineer and
approved by the Building Official;
[Amended 5/30/2010]
2. Subdivision proposals shall be reviewed to assure that all such proposals shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; all public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize and eliminate flood damage; and adequate drainage
shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. Flood elevation data shall
be included with all subdivision proposals. Where flood elevation data is not
available, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
analysis performed by a licensed professional engineer that generates base flood
elevations for all subdivision proposals and other proposed development,
including manufactured home parks and subdivisions;
[Amended 5/30/2010]
3. New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems;
4. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems;
5. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
6. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall
have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to at least one foot above the
Page VIII-6
base flood level. If the structure is substantially improved as defined by Section
210 (Substantial Improvement), then the entire structure must be made to
conform with all requirements of Section 820;
7. All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to at least one foot
above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure shall be
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
8. Where floodproofing shall be utilized for a particular structure in accordance
with Subsection 825, a Connecticut Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect shall certify that the flood proofing methods shall be adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood, and a record of such certificate
indicating the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained with the Commission.
9. For all new construction and substantial improvements, fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are useable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access, or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters.
10. Designs for meeting the requirement in (9) above must either be certified by a
registered Professional Engineer or Architect and must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria. A minimum of two openings having a total net
area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no
higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the
automatic entry and exit of flood waters.
[Amended 5/30/2010]
11. Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other
proposed developments.
12. Recreational vehicles (as defined in this section) placed on sites shall either (1)
be on-site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, (2) be fully licensed and ready
for highway use, (A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.), or
meet all the general standards of 825 (d) and the elevation and anchoring
requirements of 825 d. (13), (14) and (15) and 825 (f), the elevation and
anchoring requirements. Storage of recreational vehicles must also comply with
Section 403k of these Regulations.
[Amended 5/30/2010]
Page VIII-7
13. In areas of special flood hazard (A and AE Zones), any manufactured home to
be newly placed, undergoing a substantial improvement or repaired as a result of
substantial damage, shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest floor is at
least one foot above the base flood elevation (BFE). The manufactured home
must also meet all the construction standards for Zones A and AE as per Section
825. This includes manufactured homes located outside a manufactured home
park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision, or on a site in an existing manufactured
home park in which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a
result of a flood.
[Added 5/30/2010]
14. In all coastal high hazard areas (VE Zone), any manufactured home to be newly
placed, undergoing a substantial improvement or repaired as a result of sustained
substantial damage, shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structural member is at least one foot above the base flood elevation. The
manufactured home must also meet all the construction standards for the VE
Zone as per Section 825. This includes manufactured homes located outside a
manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or
subdivision, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, in an
expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or on a site in
an existing manufactured home park in which a manufactured home has incurred
substantial damage as a result of a flood.
[Added 5/30/2010]
15. All manufactured homes within areas of special flood hazard and coastal high
hazard areas shall be placed on a permanent foundation which itself is securely
anchored and to which the structure is securely anchored so that it will resist
flotation, lateral movement and hydrostatic pressures. Anchoring may include,
but not be limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. All
manufactured homes shall be installed using methods and practices that
minimize flood damage. Adequate access and drainage should be provided.
Elevation construction standards include piling foundations placed no more than
ten (10) feet apart, and reinforcement is provided for piers more than six (6) feet
above ground level.
[Added 5/30/2010]
e. Within the regulatory floodway, delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map,
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, repairs to
substantially damaged structures and other developments that would result in any
(0.00 feet) increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge,
shall be prohibited. The provision of proof that there shall be no (0.00 feet) increase
in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge due to the proposed
construction or encroachment shall be the responsibility of the applicant and shall be
based on hydrologic and hydraulic studies, performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice, and certification, with supporting technical data, by a
Connecticut Registered Professional Engineer.
[Amended 5/30/2010]
Page VIII-8
f. In the coastal high hazard zones, VE Zone, the following provisions shall
additionally apply:
1. All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of the Connecticut
Coastal Jurisdiction Line as defined in CGS 22a-359 as amended by Public Act
12-101;
2. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated on
adequately anchored pilings or columns, and securely anchored to such piles or
columns so that the lowest portion of the structural members of the lowest floor
(excluding the pilings or columns) shall be elevated to at least one foot above the
base flood level;
3. A Connecticut Registered Professional Engineer or Architect shall certify that
(1) the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor
(excluding piling and columns) is elevated at least one foot above the base flood
elevation; and (2) the pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is
anchored and resistant to floatation, collapse and lateral movement due to the
affects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on any building
components;
4. All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the space below
the lowest floor free of obstructions or be constructed with breakaway walls
intended to collapse under stress without jeopardizing the structural support of
the structure; such temporarily enclosed space shall not be used for human
habitation. Such temporarily enclosed space shall be used solely for building
access, parking of vehicles, and/or storage.
5. No use of fill for structural support of buildings shall be permitted.
6. Non-supporting breakaway walls, lattice work or mesh screening shall be
allowed below the base flood elevation provided it is not part of the structural
support of the structure and is designed so as to break away under abnormally
high tides or wave action, without damage to the structural integrity of the
structure on which it is to be used and provided the following design
specifications are met: (1) Design safe loading resistance of each wall shall not
be less than ten (10) pounds per square foot or more than twenty (20) pounds per
square foot; or (2) If more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot, a licensed
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design wall collapse
would result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base
flood event, and the elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation
system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage
due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building
components prior to or during the collapse of such wall. Such enclosed space
shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles, and/or storage.
7. There shall be no alteration of sand dunes that would increase potential flood
damage.
Page VIII-9
g. In all areas of special flood hazard and coastal high hazard areas as applicable, the
following shall additionally apply:
1. The Commission shall obtain, review and reasonably use any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from Federal, State or other sources
including the information provided by Federal Insurance Administrator, as
criteria for requiring that the requirements of these regulations, including but not
limited to, Subsections 825.d(6), 825.d(7), 825.f(2) and 825.f(4), 825.g(2), and
825.g(3) shall be met.
2. Where base flood elevations have been determined, and whether or not a
floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other
development (including fill) shall be permitted which will increase base flood
elevations. The Commission may authorize regulated activities provided there is
a certification from a registered professional engineer that the proposed
development, considered cumulatively with all anticipated development and
likely activities along the watercourse, shall not increase base flood elevations
more than one foot.
3. Should data be requested or provided, a regulatory floodway shall be adopted
based on the principal that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the
base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot
at any point along the watercourse. The provisions of Subsection 825.g(2) shall
apply to newly adopted floodways.
4. The applicant shall either obtain a written report indicating recommendations,
preliminary approvals, final approvals or disapprovals from any State or Federal
Department or Agency such as Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Connecticut Department of
Transportation, etc., having jurisdiction over the application or any aspect
thereof; or otherwise provide sufficient written evidence that such State or
Federal agency approval appears to have a reasonable probability of success. In
the event that any State or Federal agency has a policy that precludes the
provision of such decision until after the Planning & Zoning Commission has
rendered its decision, the Planning & Zoning Commission may waive this
requirement. If the Commission determines that a State or Federal agencys
approval has a material impact on the approved application, further review by
the Commission may be required. Copies of any permits or approvals must be
provided and maintained on file with the development permit.
[Replaced 5/30/2010]
h. Alteration of watercourses: For an application to alter a watercourse the
Commission shall consider the character and degree of injury to, or interference
with, safety, health or the reasonable use of property which would be caused or
threatened. This includes recognition of potential damage from erosion, turbidity or
siltation; loss of fish and other beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation;
the dangers of flooding and pollution; and destruction of the economic, aesthetic,
recreational and other public or private uses, and values of wetlands and
watercourses. Notification of any activity falling under this Section shall be sent to
the State DEP and to adjoining towns, if applicable. Evidence of notification shall
Page VIII-10
be sent to the FEMA. In all such cases, if a watercourse has been altered or a
portion of the watercourse has been altered or a portion of the watercourse has been
relocated, the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will be maintained and it
will not be diminished. In addition, all requirements of the Town Environmental
Protection Commission shall be met in full.
i. Aboveground Storage Tanks - Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which
are located outside or inside of the structure must either be elevated above the base
flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down
straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended
above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of
flood water.
[Added 5/30/2010]
j. Portion of Structure in Flood Zone - If any portion of a structure lies within the
Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire structure is considered to be in the
SFHA. The entire structure must meet the construction requirements of the flood
zone. The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or
any other structure attached to the main structure. Decks or porches that extend into
a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the standards of
the more restrictive zone.
[Added 5/30/2010]
k. Structures in Two Flood Zones - If a structure lies within two or more flood zones,
the construction standards of the most restrictive zone apply to the entire structure
(i.e., V zone is more restrictive than A zone; structure must be built to the highest
BFE). The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or
any other structure attached to the main structure. (Decks or porches that extend into
a more restrictive zone will require the entire structure to meet the requirements of
the more restrictive zone.)
[Added 5/30/2010]
l. No Structures Entirely or Partially Over Water - New construction, substantial
improvements and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage cannot
be constructed or located entirely or partially over water unless it is a functionally
dependent use or facility.
[Added 5/30/2010]
826. Application Procedures
a. Prior to the submission of any application hereunder, the applicant should consult

c. No application shall be deemed complete and ready for consideration by the
Commission unless it shall be in such form and contain such information as is
outlined in Subsection 826.d below.
Page VIII-11
d. All information submitted in the application shall be considered factual, or in the
case of anticipated activity, binding. A knowing failure on the part of the applicant,
or any of his agents, to provide correct information or performance not specifically
authorized in the permit shall be sufficient grounds for the revocation of any permit
issued under these Regulations and/or for penalties to be imposed.
e. All applications shall include the following information in writing and shall be on a
form provided by the Commission:
1. The applicant's name, home and business addresses and telephone numbers;
2. The owner's name (if applicant is not the owner of the property), home and
business addresses and telephone numbers and written consent to the proposed
activity set forth in the application;
3. The elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including
basement) of all structures as measured by a Licensed Surveyor or registered
Professional Engineer. For structures located in the V Zones, the elevation of
the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (including piling
and columns);
4. The elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has been
floodproofed, and a certification by a registered Professional Engineer that the
floodproofed structure meets the requirements of these Regulations;

proposed activity, including a description of the land in sufficient detail to allow
identification of the properties on the map;
6. Purposes and descriptions of the proposed activity;
7. A statement certifying that all necessary permits have been obtained from
federal, state and local governmental agencies from which prior approval is
required;
8. A Site Plan for all proposals. Such map shall be prepared by a licensed
surveyor, Professional Engineer, Architect or Landscape Architect and shall
show the approval and seal of a registered Professional Engineer. The map shall
be drawn in accordance with the Commission's regular procedures. Detailed
information on this Site Plan shall include, but not be limited to:
a) Property lines of the real property to be affected, the owners of record of that
property and of adjoining properties and the structures existing on the
affected property;
b) Locations on or near the affected property of wetlands or watercourses, as
delineated on the Town's official wetlands map;
Page VIII-12
c) Existing and proposed drainage structures such as culverts, catch basins,
drainage ditches and dams, including complete computations used in arriving
at the drainage design;
d) Locations of all existing and proposed waste treatment facilities;

f) Significant vegetation and/or landscape plans;
g) Proposed grading of any earth movement anticipated, by vertical contours as
required by the Commission;
h) The elevation of the 100 year flood boundary, the location of the 100 year
flood plain, and the floodway/floodway fringe, where applicable.
9. In all areas of special flood hazard (A and AE Zones), the Commission will
obtain, record and maintain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the
lowest floor (including basement) of all new construction, substantial
improvement or repair to a structure that has sustained substantial damage and
the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which all new construction,
substantial improvement or repair to a structure that has sustained substantial
damage has been flood-proofed. In all coastal high hazard areas (VE zones), the
Commission will obtain, record and maintain the elevation of the bottom of the
lowest horizontal structural member for all new construction, substantial
improvement or repair to a structure that has sustained substantial damage.
[Added 5/30/2010]
827. Filing Fee
A filing fee shall be submitted for all applications which shall require a full review in
accordance with these requirements. (See Appendix B.) No fee shall be required if the
application shall be found to require only an administrative review per Subsection 828c.
828. Application Review
a. A copy of all application materials shall be referred to the Director of Public Works,
Environmental Protection Commission and other departments by the Commission as
appropriate for their review. All comments received shall be entered into the record
of the application. Any deviation from their recommendations which shall be
approved by the Commission as part of any application approval shall be set forth in
writing and shall include the reasons for deviating from the recommendation. In no
case shall an approval be given which does not conform with the minimum
requirements of these Regulations.
b. Where interpretation shall be needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the
areas of special flood hazards, the Commission shall make the necessary
interpretations based upon additional data submitted by a licensed Land Surveyor or
registered Professional Engineer. Any person contesting the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation.
Page VIII-13
c. Where a regulated activity shall be proposed, which the applicant can reasonably
demonstrate shall be likely to have no adverse effect on levels of flooding or erosion,
the applicant may submit a preliminary plan for review by the Commission. The
Commission will review all proposed regulated activity to determine whether the
proposed development and building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. The
preliminary plan shall be accurately drawn to scale from a certified survey of the
property and shall show all existing features, including buildings, roads and natural
features and sufficient data to adequately describe the proposed work and activities
to be carried out. The Commission may require additional data and mapping to be
submitted by the applicant where it judges the submission inadequate and may
exercise its option as to the need to have a registered Professional Engineer review a
minor development.
The proposal shall then be informally reviewed by the Planning and Zoning
Director, the Director of Public Works and a representative of the EPC. Where they
find from the preliminary submission that the scope of the proposed work or activity
shall be in fact so limited or insignificant that it shall present no adverse impact on
levels of flooding or erosion, they may issue an Administrative Permit for the
activity or work. Prior to the issuance of an Administrative Permit, the applicant
shall show upon the prescribed application form that adjoining property owners have
been advised of the project and have concurred that the proposed activity shall have
no adverse flooding or erosion impact. Such Administrative Permit shall be signed
by the Planning and Zoning Director.
Where, in the opinion of the Planning and Zoning Director, any reasonable doubt
exists pertaining to the insignificance of any such work or activity under this
Section, the applicant shall be notified that a full application shall be required for
further review of the proposed activity.
[Amended 5/30/2010]
d. Summary Ruling. If the Commission shall find that a proposed activity is a
regulated activity in conformance with the requirements of these Regulations, it may
allow the activity with or without conditions after initial review. In order to grant a
permit at this stage, the Commission, after full review of all pertinent factors, shall
issue an opinion presenting its reasons for granting the permit with or without
conditions. Such decision shall be publicized in the usual manner.
e. A Public Hearing may be held at the discretion of the Commission. If such Public
Hearing is to be scheduled, then:
1. All applications shall be submitted, notice published, heard and decided upon in
accordance with established schedules per General Statutes;
2. No filing fee shall be refunded after a notice of hearing is published;
3. All applications, maps and documents relating to this hearing shall be open for
inspection in the office of the Commission.
Page VIII-14
829. Permit
a. The Commission shall issue a written opinion presenting reasons for its action at the
time of granting a permit, granting a permit with conditions or limitations, granting
an extension of time on an existing permit, or denying a permit.
b. The Commission may deny a permit with or without prejudice. If a permit shall be
denied with prejudice, the application shall not be resubmitted for a period of one
year following the date of denial. If a permit shall be denied without prejudice, the
applicant may modify, amend or correct his proposal and resubmit it to the
Commission.
c. If a permit shall be granted with conditions or limitations, and the applicant shall
dispute such conditions or limitations, he may amend, modify or correct his
proposal. Rejection of a modified, amended or corrected proposal shall be
equivalent to the denial of an application for the purposes of Subsection 831.
d. Any applicant may withdraw his application at any time prior to the Commission's
final action thereupon for good cause stated in writing. Any filing fee paid by the
applicant pursuant to these Regulations shall not be refunded.
e. A certification from a registered Professional Architect or Professional Engineer that
the construction and floodproofing has been completed in conformance with the
permit and these Regulations shall be submitted to the Commission prior to the
issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.
The Commission, with the written consent of the applicant, may extend the time
prescribed in these Regulations for action by the Commission, in accordance with
applicable General Statutes.
f. No activity for which a permit or license has been issued pursuant to these
Regulations shall be conducted upon the subject parcel prior to the effective date or
after the expiration of the permit. Any permit issued by the Commission shall be
subject to any expiration date the Commission may establish as part of its decision.
This shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. Any expiration date established by
the Commission shall be expressly set forth in its decision and may be conditioned
upon the completion of certain work or fulfillment of certain conditions set out in the
decision. Extensions of this period may be granted by the Commission, as
applicable, on written application to it, adequately setting forth the justification for
such extension.
g. The Commission shall consider the following in making its final decision on all
permit applications:
1. All evidence offered at any Public Hearing on the character and extent of the
proposed activity, on the land involved, and on possible effects of the activity on
the subject parcel and on surrounding areas;
2. Any reports from other local, state or federal agencies;
Page VIII-15
3. Additional requested information;
a) The character and degree of injury to, or interference with, safety, health, or
the reasonable use of property which would be caused or threatened. This
includes recognition of the danger that materials may be swept onto other
lands to the injury of others, of potential damage from erosion or siltation,
loss of wildlife and vegetation, the dangers of flooding and pollution, and
destruction of the economic, aesthetic, recreational and other public and
private uses and values of flood and erosion-prone areas;
b) The suitability of such action to the area for which it is proposed;
c) Measures which could mitigate the impact of the proposed activity and may
be imposed as conditions of the permit. Such measures include the
availability of further technical improvements or safeguards added to the
plan to avoid a reduction in the natural function of the flood and erosion
prone area;
d) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
e) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
f) Any previous inundation of subject parcel.
830. Performance Bond
A performance bond, acceptable in form to the Commission, covering all costs of approved flood
damage prevention improvements and any special floodproofing or structural requirements may be
required prior to the issuance of any final approval given under these Regulations. Said bond shall
be returned upon receipt of "As-built" drawings with certification by a Registered Professional
Engineer that all construction conforms with the approved permit and these Regulations.
831. Appeal and Variance Procedures
a. Variances from these Flood Damage Prevention Regulations shall be heard by the
ZBA in accordance with the requirements of the General Statutes.
b. Variances may be issued for the construction, rehabilitation or restoration of
structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places of the State Inventory of
Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this
Section.
c. Any variance granted shall include notice to the applicant that the result of granting a
variance from these Regulations may result in higher flood insurance rates.
d. Variances shall be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots
with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, only in conformance
with the following procedures:
Page VIII-16
1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant;
3. A determination that the granting of a variance shall not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, creation
of nuisances, fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances; and
4. A determination that the variance shall be the minimum necessary, considering
the flood hazard, to afford relief.
e. The applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of a community official
that: (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level
shall result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as
$25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and (2) such construction below the base
flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained
with a record of all variance actions as required below.
f. The ZBA shall: (1) maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification
for their issuance, e.g. - that due consideration has been given to the following
concerns: (i) the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others; (ii) the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; (iii)
the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the
effect of such damage on the individual owner; (iv) the importance of the services
provided by the proposed facility to the community; (v) the necessity to the facility
of a waterfront location, where applicable; (vi) the availability of alternate locations,
for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; (vii) the
compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; (viii)
the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain
management program of that area; (ix) the safety of access to the property in times
of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; (x) the expected heights, velocity,
duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of
wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and (xi) the costs of providing
governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and
repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems, and streets and bridges; and (2) report such variances issued in its annual
report submitted to the administrator.
g. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in
flood level during the base flood discharge would result.
832. Other Permits and Licenses
Nothing in these Flood Damage Prevention Regulations shall supersede or take the place of any
requirement for the applicant to obtain any assent, permit, license, authorization required by law or
regulations of the United States, the State, or any political subdivision thereof. The obtaining of
such assents, permits, licenses or authorizations shall be the sole responsibility of the applicant.
Page VIII-17
833. Conflict, Severance and Legal Construction
a. Where there shall be a conflict between the provisions of these Regulations and
those of any other federal, state or local act, charter provisions, ordinance or
regulations, the provisions which impose the greatest restriction on use shall govern.

Regulations shall not affect the validity of any other part which can be given effect
without such invalid part or parts.
Page VIII-18
SECTION 840. PRESERVATION OF SIGNIFICANT NATURAL, SPECIAL AND/OR MANMADE
FEATURES AND RELATED OPEN SPACE AREAS IN THE SUBDIVISION OR
RESUBDIVISION OF LAND
841. Background and Purposes
Where the Commission shall determine that significant natural, man-made or special
features exist on a site proposed for subdivision or resubdivision, the protection and
preservation of which would promote the purposes of these Regulations, the specific area,
width, depth, frontage, yard and coverage requirements established by Section 400 and the
various Area and Bulk Requirements Schedules may be modified to achieve such protection
or preservation. Such action may be taken provided that all plans, policies and other
relevant regulations of the Town shall be adhered to and further that the terms of this
Section are met in full. Applicable features shall include, but not be limited to, streams,
water bodies, shorelines, wetlands, rock ledges, steep slopes, major trees, views, waterfalls,
wildlife habitats, stone walls, historic sites, landmarks, or unusual natural features.
The intent of these Regulations shall be to provide reasonable flexibility in the division and
subsequent development of land, when, in the judgment of the Commission, such flexibility
shall insure the conservation or preservation of features or areas which contribute to or
provide for the health, safety and general welfare of the Town and the particular neighborhood
in which such features or areas shall be located.
The Commission may require modifications to subdivision or resubdivision plans when one
or more of the following is to be accomplished:
a. To preserve and protect the natural and cultural environment of the Town by
encouraging the permanent preservation of specific features and lands which, in
turn, contribute to the stabilization and enhancement of residential amenities and
values and the maintenance of the Town's predominantly residential character.
b. To conserve and protect areas having conservation value, particularly those areas
and features having qualities of natural beauty, ecological significance, or historic
interest.
c. To preserve and protect wetlands, marshes, streams, rivers and ponds as natural
resources and to avoid flooding, erosion and water pollution.
d. To more fully protect the health and safety of the people by restricting the extent to
which steep slopes, poor soils and similar areas shall be utilized for streets, drives,
waste disposal systems and other problem development.
e. To allow dedication for, or access by, the general public to land areas or cultural
facilities when it shall be determined by the Commission that such shall be
necessary to the general welfare of the neighborhood or Town and shall be
consistent with established plans and policies.
Page VIII-19
842. Standards and Criteria
a. Any subdivision or resubdivision plan modified under the terms of this Section shall
in no way change the intensity of use as prescribed for the applicable zone and shall
not adversely alter the visual character of the immediate neighborhood or otherwise,
in the judgment of the Commission, have any detrimental effect on the surrounding
area.
b. The concept of single-family detached dwelling units shall be maintained in all
cases. No exceptions shall be permitted in the R-2, R-l, R-1/2 or R-1/3 zones which
would reduce the minimum standards below those established for the R-1/5
residential zone. Within the R-1/5 zone, the specified requirements may be reduced
by not more than 25 percent. A maximum building coverage of 20 percent shall
apply to all building lots.
c. The features to be preserved and the precise extent of the area or areas within which
such features are to be located shall be clearly and accurately delineated on the plan
and their significance described in writing on the application or in attachments
thereto.
d. The area or areas so restricted by notation on the plan shall be preserved in a natural
or undisturbed condition in perpetuity or may be used for specific purposes that the
Commission determines to be desirable and necessary for the welfare, values and
livability of the general area.
e. A suitable instrument which sets forth the proposed easements and restrictive
covenants shall be required to be incorporated within all deeds and conveyances of
property within the subdivision; said easements and/or covenants shall establish, to
the satisfaction of the Commission, adequate and proper arrangements governing the
extent and conditions of use, ownership, tax liability with lien provision, and
maintenance responsibility for all areas of open space and/or features to be preserved
in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
f. The extent of variation from the specific requirements of the Schedule shall be
shown or noted on the plan and reference made to this Section by notation thereon.
g. The Commission may impose additional requirements as conditions of approval for
the modified subdivision plan including, but not limited to, the provision of buffer
areas, site development limitations, landscaping, architectural controls, and similar
stipulations. All such requirements shall be directed at fulfilling the purposes of this
Section.
h. In the event of any conflict in requirements as they may apply to a particular site, the
more restrictive requirements shall be deemed to apply.
843. Procedure
The Commission shall pursue the following procedure in reviewing and acting upon any
subdivision or resubdivision application submitted under the terms of this Section:
Page VIII-20
a. Prior to developing any formal applications, a sketch plan shall first be submitted to
the Commission's office for an informal determination by the Planning and Zoning
Director that the proposal generally meets the intent and purposes of this Section.
b. Upon receiving a positive determination in writing from the Commission's office, a
preliminary application shall be developed and submitted for the Commission's
consideration. Required materials shall include a specified number of copies of:
1. A sketch plan which establishes a realistic indication of the number and location
of lots and buildable areas which would be allowed under the basic regulations
of the Town;
2. A preliminary plan setting forth the proposed subdivision concept and clearly
establishing the criteria under which an exception is being requested. Such
preliminary plan shall generally comply with requirements established under
Article III of the Subdivision Regulations;
3. Any other documentation, legal instruments, photographs, plans or other
materials required to support the application.
c. Upon receipt of the required materials, copies of the application shall be referred to
appropriate Town agencies for review and comment.
d. All reviews of preliminary plans shall be designed to aid the applicant in the
preparation of an acceptable final plan and shall not be construed as the application
required for approval herein nor shall any preliminary planning recommendations
made by the Commission be binding on the Commission in its action on any formal
application to be made under this Section.
e. Within 45 days of the receipt of the preliminary application, the Commission shall
schedule an informal hearing on the proposal.
f. Subsequent to receiving any Commission approval of the preliminary application,
the applicant shall prepare final plans and documents incorporating all requirements
established by the Commission. Such final plans shall be developed in compliance
with the requirements set forth in the Town's Subdivision Regulations, Section 1000
of the Zoning Regulations and any additional standards prescribed by the
Commission.
g. The Commission shall schedule a Public Hearing on the application within 65 days
of the receipt of all required materials. Such hearing shall be held under the terms of
both the Special Permit provisions of the Zoning Regulations and those for a
Subdivision Plan.
844. Approved Applications
a. The Commission shall set forth its specific findings in all decisions on applications
under this Section. Such findings shall reflect the purposes set forth in this Section
and, in addition, shall comply with applicable purposes set forth in Article I of these
Regulations, and the findings described under Section 1000.
Page VIII-21
b. Processing of approved plans shall comply with appropriate provisions of the
Subdivision Regulations and Special Permit requirements.
c. No change or amendment shall be made in the layout, location or design of features
as provided on the approved subdivision plan, legal instruments or other approved
documents unless the changes or amendments are first approved by the Commission.
Application for such amendments or changes shall be made in the same manner as
for a new application.
d. Any approval granted pursuant to the provisions of this Section which shall not have
been complied with in full within one year of the approval date shall become null
and void. Such full compliance shall include the filing of any required legal
instruments, incorporation of necessary deed covenants, posting of performance
bonds, dedication of lands, and similar requirements but shall not necessarily include
the completion of all required site improvements.
Page VIII-22
SECTION 850. LAND FILLING, EXCAVATION AND EARTH REMOVAL
851. Special Permit Required
No person shall regrade, fill or excavate any land, or remove earth from any premises, for
any purpose, except as described below, without having first procured a Special Permit for
such activity from the Commission in accordance with the provisions of Section 1000.
Earth regrading, filling, excavation and removal exempt from the provisions of this Section
shall be limited to necessary excavation, filling and grading incidental to: a roadway or
parking facility approved by the Commission; installation of essential septic systems, water
lines, sewer pipe, storm drainage systems including dry wells, gas, electric and telephone
services, and similar necessary utility features as part of a project approved by the
Commission or its staff; and to home landscaping projects carried out by or for the owner
which require less than 20 cubic yards of excavation, fill or regrading for completion, or in
the alternative consist entirely of finish grading or topsoiling not altering the existing land
contour by more than six inches, provided however, that the exemptions described above
shall not apply to areas regulated by Sections 810 and 820.
In addition, the construction or alteration of a building or structure on the same premises for
which a Zoning Permit has been issued may be exempt if such activities do not involve any
area(s) beyond 25 feet of the perimeter of the construction or 50 cubic yards of material.
Sufficient information to establish this clearly must be submitted together with the
application for a Zoning Permit.
Commission staff may review and approve any project which requires less than 50 cubic
yards of excavation, fill or regrading; or a project which consists entirely of finish grading or
topsoiling not altering the existing land contour by more than eight inches, if in its
determination, it will have no impact on adjoining properties.
[Amended 12/31/2000]
852. Application
Application for a Special Permit for land filling, excavation, regrading or earth removal
shall satisfy all requirements of Section 1000. In addition, depending upon the precise
nature of the Permit request, the Commission may require any or all of the following: A
detailed map of the entire premises showing existing and proposed contour lines at two
foot intervals, existing and proposed drainage, proposed exit and entrance roadways and
stockpile areas, major trees, watercourses and wetlands, structures existing and proposed,
proposed fencing, and all other relevant information. The Commission may also require
that the seal of a registered Professional Engineer be included on any submitted map or
maps based on a certified survey of the property.

g. Such other factors as may relate to the healthful, safe and harmonious development
of the Town.
854. Limitations and Environmental Impact Statement
In addition to the findings required above, and by Section 1000, excavation, fill or grading
shall not:
a. Extend within 50 feet of a wetland, watercourse, stream, pond, river or tidal
waterfront, unless specifically authorized by the EPC.
b. Extend within 15 feet of the boundaries of the premises, unless it can be shown to
have no negative impact on the adjacent properties, and is specifically authorized by
the Planning and Zoning Commission.
c. Establish lateral support or other finished slopes in excess of one foot of vertical rise
in elevation per each two feet of horizontal distance, except where firm bedrock is
permitted to be exposed.
d. Be finished with less than six inches depth of arable topsoil, well planted and
stabilized, over the entire disturbed area (except for permitted water, rock, structure
and paved areas).
e. Permit loose debris, such as rocks, stumps, brush, junk or other foreign material to
remain exposed on the finished surface of the ground.
f. Result in excessive flying dust, noise, hazard to children or pedestrians, or danger to
adjacent properties or passing vehicles.
g. Result in unreasonable disturbance to the safety, health and tranquility of the general
neighborhood.
h. Inflict any substantial detriment on the natural environment or on the irreplaceable
natural resources of its environs, as judged by the Commission.
i. Cause any negative effects on storm water drainage, especially as it may impact
adjacent properties.
Page VIII-24
To secure the above conditions, the Commission, in granting a Special Permit, may attach
reasonable limitations on hours of operation, extent of area disturbed at one time, locations
of stockpiling and other activity, signs and lights, vehicular patterns and activity, and noise,
and may require fencing, screening, covering of stored or transported materials and such
other measures as shall be necessary to protect the rights of the general public and meet the
purposes of these Regulations.
[Amended 12/31/2000]
855. Preservation of Arable Topsoil
Arable topsoil from the disturbed area shall be preserved by carefully controlled stockpiling
and re-used to the maximum extent possible in establishing the minimum layer of six inches
of fertile topsoil required by these Regulations to be spread over the entire disturbed area on
completion of the excavation operation.
856. Prohibited Operations
No land fill, excavation, regrading or earth removal operation permitted by these
Regulations shall at any time result in, leave, or permit to exist, during construction or
afterward, any sharp declivities, pits or depressions, any loose banks or water-filled holes or
other major hazards.
No land fill shall make use of decomposable or other unstable material likely to cause future
land subsidence, nor of material likely to cause pollution of soil or groundwater.
Except as provided in this Section 856, no land fill, excavation, regrading or earth removal
operation shall engage in or permit to be operated on the site any processing, sorting,
crushing, grading, mixing, fabrication, or similar activities.
The Commission may allow processing, sorting, crushing, grading, mixing, fabrication, or
similar activities to be conducted on project sites in commercial zones, provided that:
1. such sites are greater than five (5) acres in area;
2. such activities shall not be conducted before 9:00 a.m. or after 5:00 p.m. during
weekdays, and not on weekends or legal holidays;
3. adequate provisions shall be implemented to prevent dust from being blown
from the site;
4. the Commission shall find that noise levels generated by such activities shall not
impact neighboring properties; and
5. on-site processing equipment shall not be used to process material that does not
originate on the site or is not for use on the site.
[Amended 12/2/2018]
857. Performance Bond Required
Before any Special Permit for land fill, excavation, regrading or earth removal granted
hereunder shall become effective, the owner or applicant may be required to file a bond
with the Commission. If required, that bond shall be in form and with surety acceptable
to the Commission, sufficient to guarantee timely and proper completion of all required
work and site restoration. The said bond shall provide for forfeiture to the Town of such
sums as shall be necessary to complete the work at the expiration of the allotted construction
Page VIII-25
period, and a 15 percent retention for a period of one year after the allotted construction
period to guarantee the proper condition of the work. No permittee shall be released from
his bonded obligation to the Town until an "as-built" topography map and plan of the site,
comparable in detail and certification to that required by Subsection 853 and showing the
completed project, shall be submitted to the Commission, and the Commission shall
determine that the required work has been satisfactorily completed.
858. Expiration
Any permit granted hereunder shall expire and be null and void one year from the date of
its approval, provided however that an extension or extensions of 12 months each, may
be granted by the Commission if it shall find substantial justification for such extension
in that such extension shall not be inimical to the welfare and tranquility of the adjacent
neighborhood.

Page VIII-29
SECTION 880  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
[Added 6/7/2009]
Stormwater management is the practice of controlling the runoff of stormwater from a site such
that the quantity of stormwater flow does not result in a cumulative adverse impact on properties
proximate to the site, or cause adverse cumulative impact downstream as a result of the proposed
development, while managing the stormwater runoff in a manner that mitigates impacts to water
quality. These regulations are intended to improve stormwater management and give reasonable
consideration to the restoration and protection of the ecosystem and habitat of Long Island Sound
as provided in Connecticut General Statutes 8-2(b), 8-23(a), and 8-35a.
a. Conformance to Established Standards. Proposed stormwater management plans are
to conform to the technical guidance and procedures in the Town of Darien
Department of Public Works Stormwater Management and Drainage Manual, as
may be amended and to the extent not inconsistent with these regulations.
b. Applicability. Proposals for any site meeting one or more of the following criteria
shall submit a stormwater management plan conforming to Section 882:
1. Construction of 1,000 square feet or more of impervious surface; or
2. Demolition and reconstruction or replacement of an existing residential
dwelling; or
3. Submission of any application subject to review and action by the Planning and
Zoning Commission if the activity is within the jurisdiction of that Commission
and/or by the Environmental Protection Commission (EPC) if the activity is
within the jurisdiction of the EPC.
If the proposed activity does not require the approval of either the Planning and
Zoning Commission or the Environmental Protection Commission, then any
stormwater management plan shall be submitted to the Zoning Enforcement
Officer (ZEO) with an application for a Zoning Permit or Certificate of Zoning
Compliance. The ZEO has thirty days to act on the application.
c. Impervious Surfaces. Impervious surface, for the purpose of this section is defined
as Building Coverage plus the area covered by driveways, sidewalks, walkways,
parking areas, terraces, patios, outside storage areas, loading and unloading areas,
and equipment pads.
d. Public Emergency. In order to help alleviate an emergency situation, the Public
Works Director may waive the requirement for a drainage analysis in order to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, if a public emergency has been
declared.
e. Exception for Coastal Areas. If a site is within the Towns Coastal Boundary, and
does not require formal review or action by the Planning & Zoning Commission or
Environmental Protection Commission, the requirement for a comprehensive
Stormwater Management Plan is waivedthe plan need only address water quality
impacts and mitigation.
Page VIII-30
881. Basic Components of Stormwater Management Plans
Comparative hydrology shall document no increase in downstream flooding conditions
for the 2, 10, 25, and 50 year storms on properties proximate to the site, or cause adverse
cumulative impact downstream as a result of the proposed development.
a. Upstream and Downstream Drainage Analysis. Stormwater management plans shall
take into account the upstream tributary drainage area and include a downstream
impact analysis for proposals which are likely to result in increased runoff, or alter
the flow of an existing discharge into a storm drainage system or watercourse. The
downstream impact analysis shall include analysis of a confluence point downstream
of the site where the area of the site is 10% or less of the area of the upstream
watershed and includes an assessment of potential adverse impacts arising from the
runoff.
b. Nonstructural Drainage Systems. Stormwater management plans shall include nonstructural
approaches to controlling runoff to the maximum extent practicable,
promoting the infiltration of rainfall into the soil and preservation of existing
drainage patterns.
c. Stormwater Runoff Quality. Stormwater management plans shall include measures
to minimize, to the extent practicable, discharge of pollutants including suspended
sediment from the site through the use of measures that control both the sources and
minimize to the extent practicable, transport of pollutants, including suspended
sediment.
d. Conveyance System. Conveyance systems for the proposed project must be
analyzed, evaluated, designed, and constructed to accommodate existing upstream
and off-site runoff onto a site in addition to the on-site runoff from the proposed
development.
e. Outlet Locations. The runoff from proposed development sites should utilize
existing outlets to the maximum extent practicable, unless it is demonstrated that
using the existing outlet would exacerbate downstream flooding or result in adverse
impacts to downstream properties or properties proximate to the site. The location of
the new outlets is critical to avoid adverse impacts to property(ies) proximate to the
site. Such point sources shall be located such that they do not adversely affect nearby
property or structures that may be proximate to the site and discharge to natural or
manmade drainage systems with adequate capacity to handle the anticipated flow.
f. Maintenance and Operation. Maintenance of drainage facilities and systems
constructed or modified as part of a proposed development, is the responsibility of
the property owner, unless otherwise dedicated to, or the acknowledged
responsibility of, a government agency or other entity.
Stormwater management plans shall include an Operation and Maintenance
(O&M) plan which shall identify the specific drainage facilities or systems subject
to the plan, inspection methods and frequencies, and maintenance methods and
frequencies. The plan shall provide for routine maintenance such as minor cleaning
Page VIII-31
usually once or twice a year and insure that the drainage facility or system is
unimpeded and operational.
g. Licensed Professional Engineer. Stormwater management plans, reports,
calculations, and O&M plans and schedules shall be prepared, signed, and sealed by
a Professional Engineer licensed in the State of Connecticut.
h. Exceedance of Minimum Standards. Applicants are encouraged to exceed the
minimum drainage standards set forth in these regulations to increase positive
impacts in flood prone areas.
882. Documentation Requirements
Stormwater management plans and reports where required in these Regulations, as
defined in Section 880 shall include the following documentation:
a. Separate topographic contour mapping showing the existing and proposed drainage
areas at an appropriate scale.
b. Floodplain boundaries and Stream Channel Encroachment Lines as defined by the
National Flood Insurance Program and the Connecticut Department of
Environmental Protection, respectively.
c. Inventory and evaluation of on-site hydraulic structures and watercourses, within or
related to areas of proposed impact, including brooks, channels, culverts, bridges,
dams, weirs, and dikes, with information on their flow capacity and physical
condition. The limiting capacity of existing structures may, at the option of the
Director of Public Works, be used to establish the allowable post-development peak
flow rate from the site.
d. Inventory and evaluation of existing and proposed on-site stormwater storage areas,
including impoundments, riverine corridors, swamps, ponds, wetlands, floodplains,
and miscellaneous depressions.
e. Identification of peak rate of runoff under pre-development and post-development
conditions from the site at each design point including those included in the
downstream impact analysis as applicable.
f. Specific documentation in support of stormwater management design shall include,
but is not limited to the following:
1. Method used to calculate Stormwater runoff.
2. Runoff characteristics of the property before and after development.
3. Watershed calculations used to develop NRCS Curve Number or Rational
Method Calculations.
Page VIII-32
4. Time of concentration calculations identifying length and slope of various
components including overland, shallow concentrated and channel flow. Time
of concentration paths shall be shown on the watershed maps.
5. Hydrologic model input and output files for all storms evaluated.
6. Subwatershed map delineating all contributing areas to each catch basin in a
proposed storm sewer system.
7. Hydraulic computations for all storm drainage systems. Computations shall
show hydraulic grade line elevations and structure rim elevations.
8. Pond and storage area stage-storage discharge calculations.
9. Soils information, including depth to seasonally high groundwater and
permeability testing and drawdown calculations for proposed infiltration
systems.
g. A complete set of construction plans. Where storm drains are proposed in roadways,
the plans shall include storm sewer specifications and profiles.
883. Hydrologic Evaluation
Various methods are available for hydrologic modeling, with some methods more
appropriate than others. Most methods are based upon land cover and time of
concentration relationships. Hydrologic models should use methods established by the
Soil Conservation Service (now Natural Resources Conservation Service) or the United
States Army Corps of Engineers. In all cases, the 2, 10, 25, and 50 year storms shall be
evaluated for existing and proposed conditions comparative hydrology, with the same
modeling methodology used for both conditions. The Director of Public Works may
waive the requirements herein if the applicant demonstrates, in writing, why a proposed
alternate method of analysis is appropriate and adequate.
a. Basis of Existing Conditions Analysis. Existing Conditions Analysis shall account
for actual on-site conditions at the time of the proposal, accounting for all
depressions, and types of land cover, except for applications involving the
demolition of an existing residential dwelling or commercial building and
replacement of the razed structure with a new structure.
Where an existing residential dwelling or commercial building is proposed to be
razed and replaced with a new structure, the basis of existing conditions analysis
shall be the sites undeveloped condition if there is no engineered detention system
on the existing site. If there is an existing engineered detention system on the
existing site, then the actual existing conditions at the time of application shall be
used as the basis of the existing conditions analysis. The local land use board or
ZEO may require a comparison to undeveloped conditions where warranted.
b. Detention Analysis. A complete runoff hydrograph evaluation is required for
projects utilizing detention methods.
Page VIII-33
884. Peak Flow Attenuation
a. The discharge of stormwater runoff from development sites shall not result in
cumulative adverse impacts on properties proximate to the site and shall not
exacerbate downstream flooding conditions.
b. In all cases, the applicant shall perform a watershed study to document that the
proposed development will not cause adverse impacts on properties proximate to or
downstream from the site. The limit of this study will be the downstream point at
which the site represents 10% or less of the total watershed area. This study shall be
done for the 2, 10, 25, and 50 year storms.
885. Infiltration and Stormwater Quality
Infiltration shall be utilized where appropriate to reduce stormwater runoff rate and
volume, to improve stormwater quality, and to recharge groundwater. Runoff from areas
with high pollutant loadings, such as gasoline stations shall not be infiltrated. All
infiltration practices shall be subject to pretreatment with another stormwater best
management practice. The Town of Darien Department of Public Works Stormwater
Management and Drainage Manual, as may be amended, shall be used as a guide.
886. Stormwater Detention Facilities
Stormwater detention facilities to temporarily store excess runoff may be used to control
peak flow rate and duration of downstream flows when coordinated with the runoff
characteristics of the watershed in which they are located and the local site conditions.
887. Certification and Maintenance Agreements
a. Prior to obtaining a Zoning Permit and/or starting work on a project, an O&M plan
or Notice of Drainage Maintenance Plan shall be recorded on the Darien Land
Records. The O&M plan either filed in the Land Records or referred to by the
Notice of Drainage Maintenance Plan shall stipulate the inspection frequency,
maintenance requirements and intervals for all proposed stormwater management
practices on the site.
b. Prior to issuance by the Zoning Enforcement Officer of a Certificate of Zoning
Compliance, a Certificate of Occupancy, or use of the site, the following shall be
submitted:
1. An improvement location survey prepared and submitted by a Connecticut
licensed land surveyor, depicting: pipe inverts, diameters and sizes, structure
inverts and elevation, and other information to adequately describe the
constructed stormwater management system. The survey shall also indicate the
extent of impervious surfaces, and topography of the completed site where
changes in grade exceed one foot.
2. A certification by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Connecticut
stating that the proposed drainage system was installed in conformance with the
approved plans. If plans were not prepared by a professional engineer, a signed
Page VIII-34
statement by the owner shall be submitted stating that the system was installed in
substantial conformance with the approved design.
888. Waivers
a. The Planning and Zoning Commission and/or the Environmental Protection
Commission may waive one or more of the provisions in Section 880 et. seq. under
any of the following circumstances:
1. Based upon the size and/or location of the subject property;
2. Based upon any unique site characteristics of the subject property;
3. Due to the scope, nature, and/or amount of work proposed within the
application;
4. Due to any prior applications for the subject property which have accounted for
stormwater management, and those drainage structures or facilities are still in
place.
The burden is upon the applicant to demonstrate why a waiver should be granted.

IX. ARTICLE IX - SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS
SECTION 900. OFF-STREET PARKING, LOADING AND VEHICULAR ACCESS
901. Background and Purposes
It is the intention of these Regulations that all structures and land uses be provided with a
sufficient amount of off-street motor vehicle parking to meet the needs of persons employed
at and/or making use of such structures or land uses, and sufficient off-street loading and
unloading facilities and safe and adequate access to and from such off-street parking and
loading facilities to meet the needs of such structures or land uses.
902. Approval of Plans
Except for single-family residences, no Zoning Permit shall be issued until a plan for
parking, loading and access is approved by the Commission in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Section 1020. The Commission shall determine that traffic access,
traffic circulation, parking dimensions, aisle width, lighting, screening and general layout of
the parking facility and required improvements shall be planned with regard to safety, to
traffic on the public street, and adequacy of access for cars and pedestrians using the parking
facility. No Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be issued for any building or land use
until the required off-street parking spaces shall be established.
903. General Requirements
903.1 Exemption
Structures and land uses in existence, or for which Zoning Permits have been
approved at the time of the adoption of these Regulations, shall not be subject to the
parking or loading space requirements of these Regulations, provided that any
parking and loading facilities then existing to serve such structures or uses shall not
in the future be reduced, except where they exceed such requirements, in which case
they shall not be reduced below such requirements. Required parking and loading
facilities shall, however, be provided as a condition for the issuance of any Zoning
Permit for any enlargement of such structures or uses in the future. In cases of
exceptional difficulty or unusual hardship to such properties arising out of this
requirement, appeal may be made to the ZBA.
903.2. Dedication to Town
Required off-street parking facilities which, after development, shall be later
dedicated to and accepted by the Town, shall be deemed to continue to satisfy the
parking requirements for the uses or structures for which they were originally
provided. Any subsequent Finished Space (not previously approved) created in a
basement or attic must provide additional on-site parking consistent with the
requirements of Section 904 and for the specific use(s) being proposed.
[Amended 9/23/2018]

903.3 Change of Use
No use of land or structure or combination thereof shall be established, expanded,
changed or altered to a different use or a more traffic or parking intensive type use
without first complying with all provisions of these Regulations. Although two
businesses may be within the same category (e.g. commercial sales and service), the
use of the land and/or structures shall not be changed to a new or different type of
business unless and until the adequacy of the parking has been approved by the
Commission or its staff.
903.4 Overnight Parking or Storage

requirements for structures and uses which do not
fall within the categories listed above shall be
determined in each case by the Commission.
Where the applicant or property owner has a previously approved site plan (prior to July 1,
2018), any new (not previously approved) finished basement space in a building that has
dedicated public parking pursuant to Section 1057 or is subject to a Joint Parking agreement
under Section 905 previously approved by the Commission, must provide additional on-site
parking consistent with the requirements of Section 904 and for the specific use(s) being
proposed. The exemption from the requirement of on-site parking or reduction of the
amount of shared or Joint Parking shall not be applicable for the creation of finished space
in the basement unless the Planning & Zoning Commission specifically finds that the
parking is sufficient to accommodate additional finished space in the basement.
[Added 9/23/2018]
905. Joint Parking
Where two or more different uses occur on a single lot, the total amount of parking facilities
to be provided shall be the sum of the requirements for each individual use on the lot, except
that the Commission may approve the joint use of parking space by two or more
establishments on the same or on contiguous lots, the total capacity of which space shall be
less than the sum of the spaces required for each, provided:
a. The Commission finds that the proposed capacity shall meet the intent of the
requirements;
b. Approval of such joint use shall be automatically terminated upon the termination of
the operation of any of such establishments;
c. Legal documentation shall be furnished establishing such rights for the duration of
such joint use.
d. Any finished basement space shall provide its own separate and distinct on-site
parking, and shall not be exempt under Section 1057, nor be allowed to have
reduced parking pursuant to any Joint Parking arrangement in effect prior to July 1,
2018 unless the Planning & Zoning Commission specifically finds that the parking
is sufficient to accommodate additional finished space in the basement.
[Added 9/23/2018]
Page IX-5
Such shared parking arrangements shall be limited to use and shall not include shared
parking by time. No parking spaces shall be reserved for any specific building tenant.
[Amended 10/24/2010]
905.1 Due to the lack of municipal parking or on-street parking within the Noroton
Heights Redevelopment Overlay Zone, the Commission there may waive only up
to a maximum of fifty percent (50%) of the parking required per Section 904.
[Added 10/24/2010]
905.2 Joint Parking in Mixed Use Developments
In mixed-use developments, the Commission may approve the reservation of onsite
parking areas for residential tenants, provided that the Commission shall find
that the remaining on-site parking shall be sufficient to meet the parking demand
of the related residential parking uses (i.e. Guests, deliveries, service providers)
and non-residential uses covered by a joint parking arrangement.
[Added 8/28/2016]
906. Location of Off-Street Parking Facilities (See Subsection 227 for illustration.)
906.1 On-Site Location
The required off-street parking facilities shall be provided on the same lot with
the structure or land use it is to serve; except that off-street parking spaces
required for structures or land uses on two adjoining lots may be provided in a
single common facility on one or both of said lots.
906.2 Exception
The Commission may permit all or part of the required spaces to be located on
any lot within 500 feet of the building, in any zone permitting such parking as a
principal use, provided that:
a. The Commission determines that it shall be impractical or unnecessary to
provide such parking on the same lot with the building and provided that the
following are complied with;
b. Such parking use shall not interfere with the proper development of the area
or zone in which it is located;
c. Such parking area shall be in the same ownership as the property it is
intended to serve.
906.3 Residential Zones
a. No required off-street parking shall be developed within required front or
side yard spaces. This provision shall not preclude temporary parking in the
driveway.
Page IX-6
b. No parking permitted, other than that for one or two-family dwellings, shall
be built or maintained within 25 feet of any boundary line of the site adjacent
to a street or to a residential use.
906.4 Non-Residential Zones
a. No required parking shall be provided in a Residential Zone.
b. No parking shall be built or maintained within 25 feet of any boundary line
of a Residential Zone, nor within 25 feet of the street line wherever the street
contains the boundary line of a Residential Zone located directly across the
street from the site.
c. Where the depth of a Non-residential Zone is less than 150 feet, the parking
setback may be reduced to not less than 10 feet subject to Commission
approval.
d. Any parking setback area as required above shall be suitably landscaped and
screened in accordance with Section 940 to shield the parking from view
from the adjoining residential area. The Commission may require that
conservation restrictions be used to protect and permanently preserve the
buffer areas.
906.5 Right-of-Way Lines
Where the parking facilities shall be located immediately adjacent to the right-ofway
line of a limited access highway or a railroad, the requisite parking setback may
be reduced to five feet from the said limited access highway or a railroad right-ofway
line subject to Commission approval.
906.6 Parking Setbacks
Subject to other specific buffer or applicable restrictions of these Regulations,
parking and off-street loading facilities (including stalls, turning areas, access drives,
etc.) shall be located in accordance with the following setbacks and requirements:

Regulations), the parking setback shall be not less than 10 feet.
[Amended 4/12/2009]
b. A buffer area of 25 feet shall be required adjacent to all residential zones.
See Subsection 944.
907. Parking Structures
Parking structures (whether above or below ground; or understructure) shall be permitted in
appropriate situations subject to approval of a Special Permit per Section 1000 et. seq.,
provided it is located below the finished elevation of surface parking or landscaped areas, or
provided that the Commission makes an affirmative finding that, due to the location and/or
design of the proposed use, no neighboring property will be adversely impacted by such
parking structure. Any such parking structure shall be fully enclosed by or attached to a
principal structure, and shall be limited to one story above the finished elevation of surface
parking. In addition, appropriate measures shall be taken to minimize the street level view of
such above ground, below ground, subgrade or understructure parking. The Commission
may require the submission of a sketch plan which clearly compares alternative proposals
for surface parking and a parking structure including landscaping or other screening.
The above-grade portion of any parking structure approved under this section shall be
subject to the setback requirements of the principal structure. The subsurface portion of a
parking structure may be located within a minimum yard, provided that no portion of the
structure shall encroach into an abutting property or right of way or adversely impact the
root structure or root system of plantings on neighboring properties. Subsurface parking
levels shall not constitute stories for purposes of calculating building height. The design of
any parking structure must architecturally blend in with surrounding design aspects and not
delineate itself as a parking structure. No part of a parking structure or access thereto,
serving a commercial use, can extend into a residential zone, or the buffer associated with
such.
[Amended 10/24/2010; 6/19/2016]
Page IX-8
908. Parking Design Specifications
a. Parking for non-residential uses shall be graded, surfaced, drained and suitably
maintained to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works to the extent necessary
to avoid nuisances of dust, erosion, or excessive water flow across public ways or
adjacent lands. The Director of Public Works may require the plan to provide for
suitable markings to indicate individual parking spaces, maneuvering area, entrances
and exits.
b. No parking space shall be designed to allow a vehicle to protrude or overhang a
sidewalk or any required landscaped area.
c. No parking in connection with any non-residential use shall be so located that motor
vehicles may enter or leave the parking or loading area across a sidewalk except at a
point or points approved as part of the plan.
d. Parking for the handicapped shall be in accordance with Article 5, Section 512 of the
State Basic Building Code.
e. All required parking areas shall be designed, shown on the required plan and laid out
in conformance with the "Design Standards for Parking" which are declared to be a
part of these Regulations. (See Subsection 226.)
f. All parking spaces shall measure at least nine (9) feet by eighteen (18) feet in
accordance with Design Standards for Parking in Subsection 226.
g. Required off-street parking facilities shall be maintained as long as the use or
structure exists for which the facilities are designed to serve. Required parking areas
developed for specific structures and uses shall be reserved at all times to those
persons who are employed at or make use of such structures and land uses, except
when dedicated to and accepted by the Town as public parking areas.
909. Off-Street Loading Requirements
Off-street loading and unloading facilities shall be located on the same lot with the use to be
served, except that the Commission may modify the requirements where, in its sole
judgment, the following requirements shall not be applicable to the specific conditions and
use of the site:
909.1 Loading Spaces Required
a. For retail and service business establishments, restaurants and other places
serving food and beverages: one space for the first 4,000 square feet of floor

is no detached sign on the premises in accordance with the following table:
Building Setback
From Street
Maximum Sign Area Allowed
0-100 feet
As per Section 935.C.1
101-200 feet Sign area per Section 935.C.1 may be increased by up to one percent
(1%) for every two feet beyond 100 feet subject to review and

201 feet or greater 150 percent of sign area as determined by Section 935.C.1 subject to
review and approval by ARB

SECTION 940. LANDSCAPING, SCREENING AND BUFFER AREAS
941. Background and Purposes
The following standards are intended to enhance the appearance and natural beauty of the
Town and to protect property values through preservation of existing vegetation and
planting of new screening and landscaping material. Specifically, these standards are
intended to reduce excessive heat, glare and accumulation of dust, to provide shade and
privacy from noise and visual intrusion and to prevent the erosion of the soil, excessive
runoff of storm water, and the consequent depletion of the groundwater table and the
pollution of water bodies, watercourses, wetlands and aquifers.
942. General Requirements
The following provisions shall apply to any use requiring a Special Permit or Site Plan
Approval:
a. Landscaping, trees and shrubs required by these Regulations shall be planted in a
growing condition according to accepted horticultural practices and they shall be
maintained in a healthy growing condition. Any landscaping, trees and shrubs
which shall be shown on an approved Site Plan and which shall be in a condition
that does not fulfill the intent of these Regulations shall be replaced by the property
owner during the next planting season for the particular plant material. Permanent
watering systems shall be encouraged.
b. A screening fence or wall required by these Regulations shall be maintained by the
property owner in good condition throughout the period of the use of the lot.
c. All landscaping, trees, shrubs and other planting material adjacent to parking areas,
loading areas, or driveways shall be properly protected by barriers, curbs or other
means to prevent damage from vehicles.
d. To the extent possible, existing trees, vegetation and unique site features such as
stone walls shall be retained and protected during construction. Existing healthy,
mature trees, if properly located, shall be considered in meeting the requirements of
these Regulations.
e. Where the Commission determines that the lot size and shape or existing structures
shall make it infeasible to comply with the requirements for a front landscape area,
buffer area, or landscaped parking area, the Commission may accept alternative
landscaping provided it shall be necessary, reasonable and in compliance with the
intent of these Regulations.
f. In cases where the edge of the pavement or sidewalk within the public right-of-way
shall not coincide with the front lot line, the property owner shall plant grass and
maintain the area between the front lot line and the edge of street pavement or
sidewalk.
g. All portions of non-residential properties which shall not be proposed as locations
for buildings, structures, off-street parking and loading areas, sidewalks or similar
Page IX-31
improvements, shall be landscaped and permanently maintained in such manner as
to minimize stormwater runoff and harmoniously blend such non-residential uses in
with the residential character of the Town.
943. Front Landscape Area
The purpose of a front landscape area is to enhance the appearance of the subject property
and the street. The desired effect is, where appropriate, to partially screen and separate the
use from public view.
Front landscape areas, where required by these Regulations, shall extend across the full
width of the lot along the interior side of the front lot line, except where driveway entrances
and exits are located, to the depth required by these Regulations. Every required landscape
area shall be planted with trees (shade or ornamental), shrubbery and ground cover or grass.
As a minimum, one deciduous shade tree having a caliper of at least two and one-half inches
(measured four feet above the root crown) and a height of eight feet shall be planted within
the front landscape area for each 50 feet or fraction thereof of lot frontage. The spacing of
trees or groups of trees shall not exceed 50 feet.
a. In all Residential, NB, DB, DMR, DBR and DO Zones, every use shall have a front
landscape area of not less than the required front yard for that zone.
b. In the SB Zone, the front landscape area shall be 6 feet except that any property on
Boston Post Road located east of Birch Road shall provide 18 feet (see Section 756).
c. In zones which do not require a minimum front yard (DC, CBD and PR), a front
landscape area may not be required, except if a front yard shall be provided, it shall
be landscaped.
[Amended 8/11/2019]
944. Buffer Area
The primary purpose of the buffer area is to provide privacy from noise, headlight glare, and
visual intrusion to residential dwellings. A buffer area shall be required along and within all
boundaries of a lot abutting or directly across a local street from any lot in a Residential
Zone. Single-family dwellings shall not be required to provide a buffer. Required buffer
areas shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet in width except as these Regulations may
otherwise permit. The buffer area shall not be used for buildings, parking, storage, refuse
collection, utilities, or any other use and any required planting or fencing required by the
Commission shall be maintained and/or replaced to accomplish the intended purpose(s).
[Amended 8/11/2019]
a. The buffer area may include fencing together with evergreen planting of such type,
height, spacing and arrangement as, in the judgment of the Commission, shall
effectively screen the activity on the lot from the neighboring residential area. Nonevergreen
planting may be included to supplement evergreen planting, but not to
take its place.
Page IX-32
b. A decorative wall or earthen berm of location, height, design and materials approved
by the Commission may be used in conjunction with the required planting and/or
buffer area.
c. Where the existing topography and/or landscaping provides natural screening, the
Commission may modify the planting and/or buffer area requirements.
945. Landscaped Parking Areas
All parking areas shall be designed in such a manner that visual impact upon the
surrounding area shall be minimized. Acceptable methods may include, but not be limited
to, the use of earthen berms, landscaping, walls, fences or other screening techniques. Street
trees and landscaped areas shall be incorporated within the paved areas to further minimize
visual impacts of such facilities. Parking areas shall comply with the following minimum
standards:
945.1 Perimeter Landscaping
For all uses except single-family residences, a landscaped area shall be provided
along the perimeter of the parking area (except where the parking area is
functionally integrated with an adjoining parking area on an abutting lot and the
accessway(s) to the street). The landscaped area shall have a minimum dimension
as per Subsection 906.6 and shall be planted with grass, shrubs, trees and other
vegetation. It shall include at least one deciduous tree having a caliper of at least
two and one-half inches (measured four feet above the root crown) and at least
eight feet in height when planted for every 50 feet along the perimeter of the
parking area.
Where the Commission shall determine that the lot size and shape or that the
existing topography or structures make it impractical to comply with this
landscaping requirement, the Commission may approve modification of this
standard provided the intent is satisfied.
Parking areas adjoining or across the street from a Residential Zone shall comply
with the standards for a buffer area (Subsection 944) rather than those above.
945.2 Open Streams
Parking, sidewalks and all paved areas shall be set back at least ten feet from any
open stream. Each strip of land thus provided shall be protected by curbing and
shall be landscaped and maintained with grass and trees or shrubbery or, if
acceptable to the Commission, left in a natural and undisturbed condition.
Page IX-33
SECTION 950. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS
951. Background and Purpose
In accordance with the terms of the Federal Communications Act of 1996, it is the intent and
purpose of the these regulations to accommodate the communication needs of residents and
businesses and the general public while protecting public health, safety, and the general
welfare of the Town and minimizing any adverse visual and operational effects of towers
and wireless communications facilities through careful analyses, design, siting and
screening. In addition, these regulations are necessary in order to:
? Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through
structural standards and setback requirements;
? Minimize any health hazards associated with the use of such equipment;
? Reduce the number of towers needed to serve the community by maximizing the
use of existing and approved suitable facilities to accommodate new wireless
telecommunication antennas including existing towers, buildings and other
facilities.
? Minimize the diminution of adjoining property values due to the location of such
devices;
? Prevent electro-magnetic radiation interference to receptor devices on adjoining
and nearby properties.
952. Definitions
For the purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply:
Antenna - a device used to receive and/or transmit telecommunications or radio signals.
Examples are panels, microwaves, dishes, and whips.
Carrier - a company that provides wireless services.
Co-Location - the use of a single mount on the ground by more than one carrier and/or
several mounts on an existing building or structure by more than one carrier. This
reduces the need to build new communications towers.
Federal Communications Commission - the Federal agency responsible for licensing and
regulating wireless communications providers. The FCC has primary regulatory control
over carriers through its powers to control interstate communications commerce and to
provide a comprehensive national system in accordance with the Federal
Communications Act.
Tower - a structure intended to support equipment used to transmit and/or receive
telecommunications signals. Examples of such structures include monopoles and lattice
construction steel structures. The term shall not include amateur radio operators
equipment as licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
Page IX-34
Tower Height - the distance from the lowest ground elevation at the base of any tower to
the topmost point of the tower.
953. General
The following guidelines, standards, application requirements, procedures and
considerations for approval shall apply to the installation, placement, replacement,
expansion, extension height, setbacks, construction, and screening of telecommunications
towers and antennae within the Town of Darien.
It is strongly recommended that, at the earliest stages of developing a proposal, the
applicant arrange to have an informal, pre-application meeting with staff to discuss these
requirements.
1. Co-Location is strongly encouraged in all applications where feasible for any
telecommunications facility. The Commission may require co-location after
independent outside evaluation of such determination of the feasibility of co-location
at the applicants expense. The applicant shall incur any and all such costs of such
needed analyses for which payment shall be made prior to any decision being
rendered by the Commission on the application.
2. A fence with a height of eight (8) feet shall be required around the tower and other
related equipment.
3. Landscaping may be required around the fence which shall consist of a minimum of
one row of evergreen trees planted not more than ten (10) feet on center. The
evergreen plantings shall be a minimum of six (6) feet tall at planting and shall reach
a minimum height of fifteen (15) feet at maturity. Such screening shall be maintained
by the owners of the property to insure its effectiveness.
4. The related unmanned equipment areas and/or building shall not exceed four hundred
(400) square feet of gross floor area per carrier per location and not more than twelve
(12) feet in height. Manned equipment incidental to the business office, maintenance
depot and/or vehicle storage is prohibited.
5. No signage or illumination of any form shall be permitted on the tower or antenna
unless required by the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Aviation
Agency or the Connecticut Siting Council.
6. Any communications equipment or devices shall not cause electro-magnetic
interference with receptor devices located on adjoining or nearby properties. As part
of the application process the name, address and telephone number of the appropriate
contact person shall be provided for each carrier and location. The purpose of this
procedure is that members of the public will have a contact person at the carriers
place of business and prompt action will be taken by the carrier to remedy any
interference caused by or reasonably attributed to the communications system.
Page IX-35
7. Directional or panel antenna(e) shall not be larger than needed, but in no case shall
exceed six (6) feet in height or two (2) feet in width. Omni-directional antenna(e)
shall not exceed twenty (20) feet in height or seven (7) inches in diameter.
8. Satellite and microwave dish antenna(e) shall not exceed six (6) feet in diameter and
building or roof-top mounted antenna(e) shall be located or screened so as not to be
visible from abutting public streets or adjoining residences, if appropriate and/or
necessary and feasible.
9. Any tower and/or antenna shall be designed and certified by a Connecticut Licensed
Professional Engineer to withstand sustained winds in compliance with prevailing
standards and an as-built certification shall be submitted upon completion of
construction.
10. Service providers shall submit full information establishing that they have exhausted
all possible avenues for sharing space or using an existing facility or structure before
any permit for a new tower shall be granted.
11. In all cases in which the Commission determines that an expert peer review of the
applicants service area, tower sharing, alternative location or other technical issues is
reasonably warranted, the applicant shall be required to reimburse the Town for the
cost of performing such peer review. Where a residential district is involved, the
applicant shall fully demonstrate that no commercial district or area can fulfill the
requirements. This payment shall be made to the Town prior to the decision by the
Commission on the subject application. The decision-making period shall be in
compliance with the State Statutes.
12. The Commission may require the posting of a bond to secure compliance with the
approved installation of all towers and/or antennae and/or to ensure the timely and
proper removal of said tower and/or antenna upon abandonment.

SPECIAL REGULATIONS
SECTION 1000. SPECIAL PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES
1001. Background and Purposes
The types of uses for which conformance to additional standards is required by these
Regulations shall be deemed to be permitted uses in their respective zones, subject to the
satisfaction of the requirements and standards set forth herein, in addition to all other
requirements of these Regulations. All such uses are declared to possess characteristics of
such unique and special forms that each specific use shall be considered as an individual
case.
1002. Authority
In all cases where these Regulations require approval by Special Permit, no Zoning Permit
shall be issued by the ZEO except after public notice and hearing in accordance with the
General Statutes and upon authorization of the Commission.
1003. Application
Application for Special Permit shall be made in writing in a form prescribed by the
Commission and shall include:
a. A detailed statement describing the existing and proposed use or uses.

1005. Standards for Approval
Unless otherwise specified, a Special Permit use shall conform to all requirements of the
district in which it shall be located and the standards contained herein.
The Commission may authorize the issuance of a Special Permit after considering the
health, safety and welfare of the public, in general, and the immediate neighborhood, in
particular, and provided the Commission shall make the following findings:
a. The location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the operations involved
in or conducted in connection with it, the size of the site in relation thereto, and the
location of the site with respect to streets giving access to it, shall be such that it shall
be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the district in which
it is located.
b. The location, nature, size, and height of buildings, walls and fences, and the nature
and extent of landscaping, screening, lighting and signs shall be such that the use
shall not hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land
and buildings, or impair the value thereof.
c. The elements of the Site Plan submitted as part of the Special Permit application
shall accomplish the objectives for Site Plan Approval as specified in Subsection
1024.
d. The design, location and specific details of the proposed use shall not adversely
affect safety in the streets nor increase traffic congestion in the area, nor interfere
with the pattern of highway circulation in such a manner as to create or augment
unsafe traffic conditions between adjoining developments and the district as a whole.
e. Streets and other rights-of-way shall be of such size, condition and capacity to
adequately accommodate the traffic to be generated by the particular proposed use.
X-3
f. Where it shall be proposed to convert a structure designed and built originally for
other uses, the applicant shall show the adaptability of such structure to the proposed
use, particularly in relation to the public health and safety.
g. Wherever possible and reasonable, consideration shall be given to the protection,
preservation, and/or enhancement of the natural environment, in conformance with
Section 100.i and the Commission may require, as a condition of approving any
plan, the use of conservation restrictions to protect and permanently preserve natural
or unique features which enhance the character and environment of the area, or that
shall be necessary for the control of sedimentation and erosion.
h. In cases involving a request for an exception of Section 654 for special permission
for first floor Business or Professional office use in lieu of commercial sales and
service within the Central Business District, the Commission shall consider the
presence or absence of off-street parking in direct proximity of the site, the character
of surrounding uses, convenience of pedestrian access, location within the CBD and
directly related types of considerations regarding the policies of the Town Plan of
Conservation and Development and the preference for commercial sales and
services uses on the first floor.
[Amended 6/29/2008; 11/19/2017; 12/24/2017]
i. Special Permits shall not be granted for home occupations when the Commission
determines that the proposed use will constitute a fire or safety hazard to
neighboring residences and/or will adversely affect neighboring property values
and/or will constitute a nuisance or otherwise be detrimental to the neighbors
because of excessive traffic, excessive noise, odor or other circumstances.
1006. Conditions and Safeguards
In granting a Special Permit, the Commission shall attach such conditions and safeguards as
may be required to protect the public health, safety and general welfare and to ensure
continued compliance with these Regulations. The Special Permit shall only authorize the
particular use or uses specified in the Commission's approval.
Any condition attached to the granting of a Special Permit shall remain with the property as
long as the Special Permit use is still in operation. These conditions and safeguards shall
continue in force regardless of any change in ownership of the property.
1007. Revocation
Failure to strictly adhere to the documents, plans, terms, conditions, and/or safeguards
approved by the Commission or its staff shall be a violation of these Regulations and dealt
with in accordance with Subsection 1104.
1008. Amendments or Modifications
An approved Special Permit may be amended or modified provided application shall be
made in the same manner as the original application subject to the same procedures for
approval; except that amendments which shall be found to be of a minor nature or which do
X-4
not materially alter the Special Permit as determined by the Commission, may be authorized
with Commission approval only, without another Public Hearing.
1009. Expiration and Renewal
Approval of a Special Permit shall be subject to any expiration date the Commission may
establish as part of its decision. This shall be determined on a case-by-case basis.
Extensions of this period may be granted by the Commission as applicable, on written
application to it, adequately setting forth the justification for such extension.
In approving a Special Permit, the Commission may require periodic renewal of the permit
to determine continuing compliance with the conditions and standards for approval.
A Special Permit shall expire if said use or uses shall cease for more than six months for any
reason, or if all required improvements shall not be completed within the stated expiration
period, or if all such required improvements shall not be maintained and all conditions and
standards complied with throughout the duration of the use. An expired Special Permit shall
be considered void.

on-street and off-street traffic congestion; that all parking spaces and maneuvering
areas shall be suitably identified; that entrances and exits shall be suitably
identified and designed to specific use radii; that the interior circulation system
shall be adequately designed to provide safe and convenient access to all
structures, uses, and/or parking spaces; that parking areas shall be provided with
suitable bumper guards, guard rails, islands, crosswalks, speed bumps and similar
safety devices when deemed necessary by the Commission to adequately protect
life and property; and that provision shall be made for safe pedestrian movement
within and adjacent to the property by the installation of sidewalks.
1025.5 Landscaping and Screening
That the general landscaping of the site shall comply with the purpose and intent
of Section 940; that existing trees shall be preserved to the maximum extent
possible; refuse containers shall be enclosed; and that parking, storage, and
service areas shall be suitably screened during all seasons from the view of
adjacent residential areas and public rights-of-way.
1025.6 Lighting
That lighting of the site shall be adequate at ground level for the protection and
safety of the public in regard to pedestrian and vehicular circulation. Specifically,
all exterior light fixtures shall be located at the minimum height from the ground
and the maximum distance from the property line necessary to provide adequate
X-11
and safe lighting of the building entrances, walkways, parking area and
accessways.
That glare from the installation of outdoor lights and illuminated signs shall be
properly shielded from the view of adjacent property and public rights-of-way.
Specifically, all exterior lighting shall be designed so that the filaments, light
sources, reflectors or lenses shall be shielded with opaque material in such a way
that the light shall be directed down and shall not be visible at a height greater
than six feet above the ground level at property lines.
The alteration of approved lighting or installation of additional lighting shall
require Site Plan Approval or modification of an existing Site Plan.
1025.7 Public Health
That all utility systems shall be suitably located, adequately designed, and

stipulations deemed necessary to assure compliance with these Regulations. A copy of
the revised approved plans (including notes of conditions and/or stipulations) shall be
submitted by the applicant to the Commissions staff for review. All time periods and
procedures specified in the decision shall be complied with or any approval will become
void.
X-12
1027. Performance Bond
1027.1 Bond
The Commission may require, as a condition of approval, that the applicant post a
bond with surety satisfactory to the Commission in order to assure conformance
with all proposed improvements (excluding buildings) shown on the approved
Site Plan. An itemized estimate of the cost of the specific improvements shall be
prepared by the applicant, including a separate inflation factor for the estimated
construction period, and shall be submitted to the Director of Public Works and
the Planning and Zoning Director for approval. The bond shall be in the form of a
certified check payable to the Town of Darien, a savings passbook with a signed
withdrawal slip for a joint account in the name of the Town and applicant, an
irrevocable letter of credit from a bank, or an insurance company performance
bond written by a company authorized to write bonds in the State of Connecticut.
If so required, said bond shall be posted with the Town, in accordance with the
approved Site Plan for a period of time as determined by the Commission.
1027.2 Release of Bond
Upon written request of the applicant for the reduction or release of the bond, the
Commission shall cause the site to be inspected by the ZEO, the Director of
Public Works, and/or other appropriate Town Officials to determine if all or a
portion of the conditions of approval have been met and if all required site
improvements have been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the
approved plans. Before release of any bond, the Commission may require the
applicant to submit an "As-Built" plan, certifying that all of the required site
improvements have been installed in accordance with the approved plans. The
Commission may require that a portion of the bond be retained after vegetative
cover and planting have been installed in order to assure adequate growth or
replacement. Based on the findings, the Commission may authorize the reduction
or release of said bond.
1028. Expiration
Approval of a Site Plan shall expire one year subsequent to approval by the Commission,
unless a Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall have been granted therefor by the ZEO,
and/or all required work completed, provided, however, the Commission shall reserve the
right to grant one or more extensions on written application to it adequately setting forth
the justification for such extension.
1029. Amendments
Site improvements and development shall be carried out in strict compliance with the Site
Plan approved by the Commission. In the event that minor amendments shall be
required, they may be approved by the Planning and Zoning Director upon written
application of the property owner. Any such approval shall be issued in writing. All
other amendments or modifications shall be acted upon by the Commission at a regularly
scheduled meeting.
X-13
1030. Certificate of Zoning Compliance
No Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be issued until the site work has been
completed in accordance with the approved Site Plan. When the site work cannot be
completed because of weather or other pertinent reasons, a conditional Certificate of
Zoning Compliance may be issued for a period not to exceed 180 days, providing a
portion of the posted bond shall be retained in an amount sufficient to complete the site
work or, if necessary, a new bond shall be posted. Upon written request of the applicant
and satisfactory completion of the site work, the Commission shall order the release of
the bond.
1031. Continuance
All conditions and improvements shown on an approved Site Plan shall remain with the
property as long as the use indicated on the approved Site Plan shall be in operation. The
conditions and improvements shall continue in force, regardless of any change in
ownership of the property.
X-14

X-15
SECTION 1050 - SPECIAL USES WITH SPECIAL STANDARDS
Each of the following uses is permitted in each zone to the extent indicated for that use and zone,
subject to these additional requirements and all provisions of the applicable zone, except as
specifically provided for in this Section.
Every application for the use of property subject to conditions set forth herein shall be filed in
accordance with the provisions of these Regulations, and shall be subject to any approval stipulated
in this Section.
1051. Protected Town Landmarks
1051.1 Background and Purposes
To preserve the cultural heritage of the Town, it is recognized that certain structures
and land areas have value as Town Landmarks, which value transcends the ordinary
standards incorporated in these Regulations and, therefore, requires that each
individual site be considered a special case. It is declared to be policy of these
Regulations that significant landmarks of the Town should be preserved insofar as
appropriate to the sound development of Darien in accordance with policies of the
Town Plan.
1051.2 Standards
a. Subject to the provisions of Section 1000, and of this Section, application may be
made to the Commission for designation and Special Use regulations establishing a
Protected Town Landmark.
b. Application shall be in a form prescribed by the Commission, and shall consist of a
Site Plan, accurate exterior elevation drawings of each building to be preserved, and
sufficient documentation to establish the historic, cultural or architectural
significance of the proposed landmark.
c. After appropriate public hearing and findings, the Commission may authorize,
without respect to specific uses and setbacks prescribed for the zone in which
located, a special set of regulations and standards applicable only to the particular
structure or site which is to be preserved. Such special regulations shall be designed
to preserve the landmark in proper condition, and to conserve the values and
appropriate uses of its environs.
d. The conservation restriction shall be one of the methods that may be used by the
Commission to protect and permanently preserve these landmarks.
e. Each Special Permit granted under this Section shall prescribe the specific uses to be
permitted, conditions to be observed, structural appearance to be maintained, and
site development or features to be adhered to, and any deviation from these
prescriptions shall constitute a nullification of the permission granted. In
determining the appropriate use, intensity of development, and structural appearance
of the landmark, the Commission shall be guided by the character of its surroundings
and the general purposes (Article I and Subsection 1051.1) of these Regulations. No
X-16
special uses shall be authorized which would be deleterious to the adjacent
neighborhood.
1051.3 Identification
Each Protected Town Landmark shall be suitably marked by an identification plaque
approved by the Commission and describing its significance. All signs, and the
identification plaque, shall continue to meet the sign provisions of Section 920.
1052. Single-Family Open Space Development
[Amended 4/12/2009]
1052.1 Background and Purposes
Open space plays an important role in Town for environmental/ conservation
purposes, aesthetic purposes and for passive enjoyment and may include
woodlands, wetlands, vacant property left in its natural state and naturally
landscaped open areas. Single-Family Open Space Development allows for the
preservation of such property.
Excess impervious surface area contributes to the volume and velocity of surface
water runoff, thereby increasing flooding potential. Establishing regulations
restricting impervious surface coverage will reduce flooding impacts caused by
development and help to maintain the character of the community. Single-Family
Open Space Development achieves these objectives by establishing a Maximum
Developed Site Area standard.
The Planning and Zoning Commission generally views a variety of housing
options as an enhancement to Darien. Housing that permits Darien residents to
downsize is needed. Single-Family Open Space Development addresses this
need by allowing more than one single-family dwelling on a lot at a density no
greater than the existing zone theoretically allows, provided that such housing is
appropriate for the specific lot and the neighborhood in general.
Single-Family Open Space Development is intended to apply to oversized lots as
an alternative to subdivision. It reduces the intensity of development on lots with
sensitive lands by deducting wetlands, steep slopes and flood zones from the lot
area for density, coverage and floor area calculations. It protects neighboring
properties with buffers and setbacks equal to or greater than those required by the
residential zone in which the property is located and with architecture designed to
harmonize with the neighborhood and surrounding uses.
Except as specifically provided herein, these regulations shall not legalize or be
construed to legalize any residential use not lawfully existing at the time these
regulations are adopted including but not limited to apartments, cottages, or any
other residential use involving more than one dwelling unit on a single lot.
X-17
1052.2 Area and Bulk Requirements
Single-Family Open Space Development is only permitted in the R-1/5 and R-1/3
Residential Zones in accordance with the Area and Bulk Requirements of
Subsection 406 of these Regulations and the additional requirements noted below.

Ratio, and Lot Area per Dwelling, the Lot Area shall exclude the following
Sensitive Land: wetlands, watercourses, land areas sloped at more than
15%, and special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood as
indicated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map and determined in conjunction
with an accurate topographic survey of the site. The submitted site plan shall
delineate the Sensitive Land as defined herein.
b. Minimum Open Space shall be 30% of the total area of the lot (not Lot Area
as defined in Note a). At least one-third (1/3) of the Minimum Open Space
shall affect property that is not Sensitive Land as determined per Note a,
above.
1052.3 Open Space
Open Space shall be the portion of the lot subject to an open space easement
approved by the Commission that requires such portion to be maintained as
indicated on the Landscape Plan and Grading and Drainage Plan approved by the
Commission. Such Open Space shall be formally demarked and vegetated with
X-18
meadow seed mix, shrubs, screening, trees, woody vegetation, and similar native
vegetation with habitat value. Up to half of the area of the Open Space may
include surface stormwater treatment practices that are so vegetated with
associated underground drainage structures (such as a rain garden, bio-retention
basin, and/or treatment wetland or similar practice). Lawn is not permitted within
designated Open Space.

buffer areas need not exceed ten (10) feet in width and, at the discretion of the
Commission, may include lawns, gardens, uncovered walks, patios, terraces and
other at grade surfaces not considered a building. Single-Family Open Space
Development is not considered a single-family dwelling under Section 940.
1052.7 Architectural Design and Review
Single-Family Open Space Development shall conform to Subsection 1023.4. In
addition, the proposed architecture shall be suitably diverse in its design and
appearance to emulate the look of a single-family neighborhood. Subsequent to
Special Permit Approval, any significant modification to the architectural plans of
an individual dwelling approved by the Commission shall be reviewed and
approved by the Architectural Review Board prior to issuance of a Zoning Permit
for such modifications.

SECTION 1100. ZONING ENFORCEMENT
1101. Authority
a. No board, agency, officer or employee of the Town shall issue, grant, or approve any
permit, license, certificate, or other authorization, including Special Permits by the
Commission, and variances by the ZBA, for any construction, reconstruction,
alteration, enlargement or moving of any building, or for any use of land or building
that would not be in full compliance with the provisions of these Regulations. Any
such permit, license, certificate or other authorization, issued, granted or approved in
violation of the provisions of these Regulations shall be null and void and of no
effect without the necessity of any proceedings or revocation or nullification thereof,
and any work undertaken or use established pursuant to any permit, license or
certificate or authorization shall be unlawful, and no action shall be taken by any
board, agency, officer or employee of the Town purporting to validate any such
violation.
b. These Regulations shall be enforced by the ZEO in accordance with the provisions
of these Regulations.
1102. Zoning Permits
a. No building or structure shall be erected, enlarged, structurally altered, demolished,
moved or removed, wholly or partly, no use of land shall be undertaken, and no
excavation for any building, structure or use shall be made, until a permit therefor
shall have been issued by the ZEO. Except upon a written authorization of the ZBA,
or except as provided in Subsection 385, no such Zoning Permit or Certificate of
Zoning Compliance shall be issued for any building where such construction,
addition, alteration, moving or use thereof shall not be in full compliance with the
specific provisions of these Regulations.
b. A Zoning Permit shall be valid for a period of one year only. The ZEO may extend
the permit, provided substantial work has been done during the period.
c. There shall be submitted with all applications for Zoning Permits three copies of a
layout or plot plan drawn to scale, showing the actual shape and dimensions of the
lot to be built upon, the exact size and location on the lot of the building and
accessory buildings existing, and the lines within which the building or structure
shall be erected or altered, the existing and intended use of each building, or part
thereof, the number of families or housekeeping units that a building shall be
designed to accommodate, and such other information with regard to the lot and
neighboring lots that may be necessary to determine and provide for the enforcement
of these Regulations. One copy of such plan shall be returned to the owner when
such plans have been approved by the ZEO.
d. The Zoning Enforcement Officer may require that upon the completion of the
foundation for any building, addition to a building, or a structure for which a Zoning
Page XI-2
Permit shall have been issued, certification by a licensed Land Surveyor or
registered Professional Engineer shall be filed by the holder of the Zoning Permit
with the ZEO, which certificate shall state that the location of the foundation is in
compliance with these Regulations. An as-built survey may also be required in
addition to, or in lieu of, a certificate.
1103. Certificate of Zoning Compliance
a. It shall be unlawful for an owner to use or permit the use of any building or
premises, or part thereof, hereafter created, erected, changed, converted or enlarged,
wholly or partly, in its use or structure, until a Certificate of Zoning Compliance
shall have been issued by the ZEO. Such Certificate shall state that such building or
premises, or part thereof, and the proposed use thereof, are in complete conformity
with the provisions of these Regulations. It shall be the duty of the ZEO to issue a
Certificate of Zoning Compliance within ten working days after completion of
improvements authorized by the Zoning Permit application, provided that he is
satisfied that the building and the proposed use of the building or premises conform
with all the requirements herein set forth.
b. Under such rules and regulations as may be established by the Commission, a
temporary Certificate of Zoning Compliance for part of a building may be issued for
a period not to exceed three months.
c. No non-conforming use shall be changed, or extended, without a Certificate of
Zoning Compliance having first been issued by the ZEO therefor.
d. A Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be deemed to authorize, and shall be
required for both initial and continued occupancy and use of the building or land to
which it applies, and shall continue in effect as long as such building and the use
thereof, or of such land, shall be in full conformity with the provisions of these
Regulations and any requirements made pursuant thereto.
e. The ZEO shall maintain a record for all Certificates of Zoning Compliance, and
copies shall be furnished, upon request, to any person having a proprietary or
tenancy interest in the building affected. Upon written request from the owner, the
ZEO shall issue a Certificate of Zoning Compliance for any building or premises
existing at the time of the enactment of these Regulations, certifying, after
inspection, that the extent and kind of use and disposition conforms with the
provisions of these Regulations.
1104. Violations and Penalties
a. Any violation whatever of these Regulations or any provision herein shall be subject
to the penalties provided by the General Statutes.
b. Any owner, lessee, tenant, occupant, architect, builder, or other agent of any of those
who shall violate or be an accessory to the violation of any provisions of these
Regulations, or who fails to comply with any of the requirements thereof, or who
shall erect, construct, alter, enlarge, convert, move, or use any building, or use any
land in violation of any provision of these Regulations, or of any detailed statements
Page XI-3
or plan submitted to, and approved by the Commission or its staff, shall be subject to
the penalties as prescribed by the General Statutes. Each day of continued or
renewed violation shall constitute a separate offense. The provisions of this
subsection shall be in addition to, and shall not preclude, enforcement by injunction
or other lawful means.
c. Any building which shall be erected, constructed, altered, enlarged, converted,
demolished, moved or removed, or used contrary to any of the provisions of these
Regulations, and any use of any land or any building which shall be conducted,
operated, or maintained contrary to any of the provisions of these Regulations shall
be, and the same is hereby declared to be, unlawful. The proper Town authorities
may institute actions in accordance with State Statutes to enforce these Regulations
including but not limited to: inspecting premises; issuing a notice of violation and/or
a Cease and Desist Order; notice of violation to be filed in the Darien Land Records;
applying to the court for Search Warrant, fines and/or monetary penalties, citation,
summons, arrest procedures, injunction, mandamus, abatement; or any other
appropriate action, to prevent, enjoin, abate or remove such erection, construction,
alteration, enlargement, conversion, or use, in violation of any of the provisions of
these Regulations. Upon the failure or refusal of the proper local officer, board or
body of the Town to institute any such appropriate action or proceeding for a period
of ten days after written request by a resident taxpayer of the Town to so proceed,
any three taxpayers of the Town, residing in the vicinity wherein such violation
exists, who are jointly or severally aggrieved by such violation, may institute such
appropriate action or proceeding in like manner as such local officer, board or body
of the Town is authorized to do. The ZEO shall serve notice by certified mail, return
receipt requested, addressed to the premises of such violation on the person or
corporation committing or permitting the same, and if such violation shall not cease
within such time as proper Town authority may specify, and a new Certificate of
Zoning Compliance shall not be obtained, they shall institute such of the foregoing
action as may be necessary to terminate the violation. Such notice may also be
served by posting on the premises.
d. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in
addition to any other remedies provided by law.
e. If a Cease and Desist Order has been issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer or
other proper Town authority, the Planning and Zoning Commission may elect not to
accept, process or approve any application with respect to the subject property unless
and until all violations of the Zoning Regulations are corrected in accordance with
the order. If the Planning and Zoning Commission decides not to accept, process or
approve any such application, it shall forward notice of such decision to the
applicant and shall also cause notice of such decision to be published in a newspaper
of local circulation in accordance with the General Statutes.
f. If during the review and processing of an application, the Planning and Zoning
Commission finds that there are existing violations of the Zoning Regulations on the
subject property, it may require, as part of any approval that the violations be
corrected prior to the filing of the Special Permit, signing of the final plan, issuance
of the Zoning Permit or other steps necessary to finalize the application process.

SECTION 1120. ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS (ZBA)
1121. Powers and Duties
The ZBA shall have all the powers and duties prescribed by Chapter 124, Section 8 and
Chapter 44, Section 22a of the General Statutes, and by these Regulations, which powers
and duties are summarized and more particularly specified below, provided that none of the
following provisions shall be deemed to limit any of the power of the ZBA that is conferred
by general law.
1122. Interpretation
On appeal from an order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative
official, or on request from any official or agency of the Town, the ZBA may decide any
question involving the interpretation of any provision of these Regulations, including
determination of the exact location of any zone boundary line if uncertainty remains after
reference to the rules specified in Subsection 314. No question of hardship shall be involved
in such an appeal, and the action of the ZBA thereon shall be limited to the question of
whether or not, and to what extent such order, requirement, decision, or determination was a
correct interpretation of the provision that is involved, and does not extend to any variance
or modification in the application of such provision or any other provision of these
Regulations.
1123. Variances
If a lot shall be of unusual size, shape or topography, or if other unusual circumstances
pertain to it or to any building that may be situated on it, and if such condition shall make it
impossible to apply strictly to such lot a specific provision of these Regulations without
resulting in exceptional difficulty or unusual hardship, but in no other case, the ZBA shall
have the power to vary or adjust the strict application of the regulations or provisions of
these Regulations so that substantial justice shall be done and the public safety and welfare
secured.
No variance in the strict application of any provisions of these Regulations shall be granted
by the ZBA unless it finds:
a. That there are special circumstances or conditions, fully described in the findings of
the ZBA, applying to the building or land for which the variance is sought, which
circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land or building and do not apply
generally to land or building in the neighborhood and have not resulted from any
willful act of the applicant subsequent to the date of adoption of the regulation or
regulations appealed from, whether in violation of the provisions herein or not.
b. That, for reasons fully set forth in the findings of the ZBA, the aforesaid
circumstances or conditions are such that the particular application of the conditions
of these Regulations would deprive the applicant of substantial justice in the use of
such land or building and the granting of the variance is necessary for substantial
justice in the use of the land or building, and that the variance as granted by the ZBA
is the minimum adjustment that will accomplish this purpose.
Page XI-8
c. That the granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the general purposes and
intent of these Regulations, and shall not be injurious to the neighborhood or
otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
d. In no case may a variance be granted which shall permit a use not otherwise
permitted in the Town. No use variances shall be granted in residential zones.
However, the ZBA may permit the reconstruction or re-establishment of a legally
non-conforming use of a property or structure following its destruction by fire, storm
or similar cause. Such permitted reconstruction or re-establishment shall be limited
in all respects to the size, nature and intensity previously existing on the site.
1124. Location of Uses
The ZBA shall be authorized to hear and decide upon all requests to locate motor vehicle
sales, service and repair uses as specified in the General Statutes.
1125. Conditions and Safeguards; Prerequisites Concerning Property in Violation
a. In all cases where the ZBA authorizes the issuance of a Zoning Permit or Certificate
of Zoning Compliance, under any of the above powers, it shall be the duty of said
ZBA to attach such conditions and safeguards as may be required to protect the
public health, safety and general welfare, and to ensure continual compliance with
these Regulations.
b. Porches, decks, storage buildings, signs, additions, and other structures which are
built or modified without the required Zoning Permit and/or Building Permit will not
be considered for a variance unless the improvement/structure or portion of the
structure which is in violation is removed, dismantled, or modified so that it is of no
benefit to the owner prior to the filing of, and during the pendency of the variance
application.
c. The Zoning Board of Appeals may elect not to accept, process or approve any
variance application with respect to the use of property or a building or both, which
is undertaken without the required Zoning Permit and/or Building Permit unless the
improper use is discontinued prior to the filing of, and during the pendency of, the
variance application.
d. A determination by the Zoning Board of Appeals that the structure has been
rendered temporarily of no benefit to the owner or that the use has been discontinued
shall be a prerequisite to further action on the application by the Zoning Board of
Appeals.
e. If a Cease and Desist Order has been issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer or
other proper Town authority, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall process a timely
appeal of the order which is filed in accordance with Subsections 1126 and 1127, but
may elect not to accept, process or approve any variance application with respect to
the subject property unless and until all violations of the Zoning Regulations are
corrected in accordance with the order.
Page XI-9
f. If the Zoning Board of Appeals elects to accept an application for a variance
together with an appeal from a Cease and Desist Order, it shall, nonetheless,
consider the issues raised by such appeal before acting upon the variance application
in accordance with C.G.S. Section 8-6a.
g. If the Zoning Board of Appeals elects not to accept, process or approve an
application under this Section, it shall forward notice of such decision to the
applicant and shall also cause notice of such decision to be published in a newspaper
of local circulation in accordance with the General Statutes.
[Amended 7/22/2001]
1126. General Rules
a. Appeals to the ZBA from an order, requirement, decision or determination made by
an administrative official or the Commission shall be made within 30 days from the
date of the receipt of the order, requirement, publication of decision or
determination.
[Amended 7/22/2007]
b. Applications or appeals to the ZBA shall be made on the form furnished by the ZBA
and shall be accompanied by updated survey plans, building plans, materials, and
other information as determined by the ZBA.
[Amended 12/29/2013]
c. The ZBA shall establish a schedule of fees necessary for the processing of hearings.
(See Appendix B.)
d. If a request for postponement of a hearing shall be made after publication of a public
notice in a newspaper, it shall be treated as a new application including all costs.
e. Applications denied shall not be heard by the ZBA again until six (6) months after
the denial or until the circumstances of the application have substantially changed.
[Amended 12/29/2013]
f. Each regulation or rule and each amendment or repeal thereof and each order of the
ZBA shall be filed in the office of the ZBA and shall be a public record.
1127. Notification
Not less than ten (10) days nor more than twenty (20) days prior to the applicants scheduled
public hearing, the applicant, or his legal representative, shall mail notification of his
application, including paragraph K of the text of the application and the scheduled date,
time and place of the hearing, to the owners of each parcel or property within 100 feet of the
perimeter of the subject property. This would include the owner of each condominium if
any portion of subject property is within 100 feet or less of the condominium association
property.
The owners and their addresses shall be determined from the latest real estate list of the
Town in the Tax Assessors Office. At least one week prior to the public hearing, the
applicant, or his legal representative, shall submit evidence of the required mailing in the
Page XI-10
form of date stamped U. S. Postal Service Certificates of Mailing, a list showing the names
and addresses of the owners of all such properties, and a copy of the notification (including
attachments) which was mailed.
[Amended 7/22/2001; 12/29/2013]
Page XI-11
SECTION 1130. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
1131. Separability Clause
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or other part of these Regulations shall,
for any reason, be held by any court of jurisdiction to be invalid, such decisions shall not
affect the validity of the remaining portion of these Regulations. The Commission hereby
declares that it would have passed these Regulations and each section, subsection, sentence,
clause, phrase, and other parts thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections,
subsections, sentences, clauses, phrases or other parts be declared invalid.
1132. Short Title
These Regulations shall be known as and may be cited as the Darien Zoning Regulations.
1133. Effective Date
These Regulations shall continue effective as adopted and any amendments thereto shall
become effective at such time as is fixed by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of
the General Statutes.
1134. Palliative Marijuana Dispensaries and Production Facilities
In response to recent State legislation authorizing palliative marijuana dispensaries and
production facilities, the Darien Planning and Zoning Commission has established a oneyear
moratorium on such land uses. During this moratorium, no application for a
palliative marijuana dispensary or production facility and no installation or creation of a
palliative marijuana dispensary or production facility shall be permitted in any zone
within the Town of Darien. This moratorium gives the Commission time to decide how,
and if, it should regulate the production and distribution of palliative marijuana and
where these facilities would be located, if they are to be allowed within Darien. This
moratorium shall remain in effect for no longer than one (1) year from its effective date.
The Commission may, after holding a public hearing, extend this moratorium for
additional time. For purposes of this subsection, the terms palliative, marijuana,
dispensary facility and production facility shall have the same definitions as the
definitions adopted by the state of Connecticut in its Regulations for State Agencies, §
21a-408-1, as amended from time to time.

Since 1925 various building lines restricting the placement of buildings in relation to streets
have been adopted by the Commission. Since these restrictions are adopted by statutory
authority given to a planning commission, they are not part of the Zoning Regulations and are,
therefore, not subject to variance by the ZBA. In all instances where these Regulations impose
different restrictions, the more restrictive requirements apply.

Street and extending from Center Street (as relocated) to Old Kings Highway South, affecting
properties fronting also on Boston Post Road and Tokeneke Road, all in CB Zone. The adopted

SUPPLEMENT TO SCHEDULE OF FEES
TECHNICAL REVIEW FEES FOR PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION,
ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION COMMISSION
Within ten days of official receipt of an application, the Director of Planning & Zoning,
or his/her designee, shall make a determination whether an outside expert is needed to analyze,
review and report on areas requiring technical review in order to assist the Planning & Zoning
Commission, Zoning Board of Appeals and/or the Environmental Protection Commission. Such
experts may include, but shall not be limited to, engineers, surveyors, architects, soil scientists,
wetland biologists, wildlife biologists, and hydrogeologists.
If such a determination is made, the Director may assess the reasonable cost for such
expert to the applicant based upon a preliminary estimate from the expert. The Director may
collect 125% of the estimate from the applicant, which amount shall be held in escrow until the
technical review is completed, and which will be the outside limit of the applicants
responsibility. Any excess amount collected over the actual cost shall be refunded to the
applicant. This payment shall be considered an integral component of the application. The
failure by the applicant to make this payment within five (5) days of notice of the fee assessment
shall render the application incomplete.
In the event the Director does not make a determination that an outside expert is needed,
the Planning & Zoning Commission, Environmental Protection Commission and/or the Zoning
Board of Appeals may make such a determination up to two (2) weeks after the commencement
of its public hearing on the application. However, prior to making such a determination, the
respective commission or board shall determine: 1) that evidence in the record of the
proceedings has been produced or is likely to be produced which requires the hiring of such an
expert; 2) that the department staff will be unable to perform the technical review; and 3) that
adequate time exists for the applicant to review and respond to such experts report. The
respective commission or board shall then make such a reasonable assessment and collect 125%
of the estimate from the applicant, which amount shall be held in escrow until the technical
review is completed and which will be the outside limit of the applicants responsibility. Any
excess amount collected over the actual cost shall be refunded to the applicant. This payment
shall be considered an integral component of the application. The failure by the applicant to
make this payment within five (5) days of notice of the fee assessment shall render the
application incomplete.
If adequate time is not available for the Director, commission or boards review and
determination on the necessity for outside expert review and/or if adequate time is not available
for the outside expert to perform the analysis and report his or her findings, then the Director will
advise the applicant and seek the applicants consent for an extension of the relevant time period
in accordance with Connecticut General Statutes § 8-7d.

APPENDIX D  PLANNING & ZONING COMMSSION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
REGARDING FILING OF NOTICE VIOLATION IN THE DARIEN LAND RECORDS
Recent court decisions have upheld the authority of towns to file a Notice of Zoning Violation in
the Land Records to protect the interests of those persons who may be financing, purchasing, or
leasing the property. The Planning and Zoning Commission wishes to amend the Zoning
Regulations to specifically permit such enforcement practices and to establish a policy to have
such notices filed in the Land Records whenever appropriate and to establish a procedure which
is fair to the property owner.
The practice of filing notices in the Land Records is discretionary and would not be appropriate
in every situation in which there is a zoning violation. It remains incumbent on anyone
interested in the property to check with the Zoning Enforcement Officer and other Town
Officials to determine if there is a violation on the property. It should not be assumed that if
there is not a Notice of Violation in the Land Records that there is no violation. The filing of the
notice in the Land Records would not preclude the sale, lease, or financing of the property, but at
least it would advise other persons of the problems and violations.
The following policies allow for a notice of violation to be filed in the Land Records and it is
required that a notice of the release be filed in the Land Records when the situation is corrected.
The procedure is as follows:
1. The Zoning Enforcement Officer has issued a Cease and Desist Order and the owner of the
property and/or tenant and/or violator have failed to comply with said order.
2. The owner/tenant/violator have failed to appeal the Cease and Desist Order to the Zoning Board
of Appeals, or the Zoning Board of Appeals has upheld the order, or portion of the order.
3. The Zoning Enforcement Officer or Director of Planning and Zoning shall place the intent to
file a notice of violation in the Land Records on the Agenda of the Zoning Board of Appeals for
discussion. Notice of time, date, and place of the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting shall be
mailed to the owner/tenant/violator by certified mail, return receipt requested, at least seven (7)
days prior to the meeting. The owner/tenant/violator of the property shall be given an
opportunity to appear before the Zoning Board of Appeals and show cause why a Notice of
Zoning Violation should not be filed in the Land Records.
4. The Zoning Board of Appeals may authorize, in writing, the filing of the Notice of Zoning
Violation in the Darien Land Records.
5. If the Director of Planning and Zoning and/or the Zoning Enforcement Officer are aware of a
situation where time is of the essence such as a pending sale, lease, financing, or refinancing of
the property, they are authorized to file a Notice of Zoning Violation in the Land Records prior
to a discussion with the Zoning Board of Appeals so long as a proceeding is conducted by the
Zoning Board of Appeals within thirty days of the filing of the notice.
6. When the violations have been corrected and all fines and/or penalties have been paid in full, the
Zoning Enforcement Officer shall file a Notice of Release of Zoning Violation in the Darien
Land Records. If the owner/tenant/violator requests that the notice of release be filed, but the
Zoning Enforcement Officer decides that the property is still in violation of the Zoning
Page D-2
Regulations or the Cease and Desist Order, then the owner/tenant/violator may appeal that
decision to the Zoning Board of Appeals as per Section 1122 of the Darien Zoning Regulations.

APPENDIX E  EXAMPLES OF INCLUSIONARY ZONING CALCULATIONS
A. Calculating the Number of Units Required
(1) Example: Nine lot subdivision:
The total number of on-site units proposed is nine (9).
The number of affordable units required: 9 X 12% = 1.08.
All of which must be affordable to households at 80% of State Median Income (SMI):
100% X 1.08 = 1.08.
Since only one unit is required (the 1.08 rounds down to 1.0), the remaining .08 units
would have to be fulfilled via fee in lieu at the 80% level standard
0.08 X $90,600 X 225% = $16,308.
(2) Example: Nine multi-family units to be constructed:
The total number of on-site units proposed is nine (9).
The number of affordable units required: 9 X 12% = 1.08.
The number of units required to be affordable to households at 80% of State Median
Income (SMI): 100% X 1.08 = 1.08.
Since only one unit is required (the 1.08 rounds down to 1.0), that unit shall be at the
80% SMI level.
The Commission could grant up to 4 additional units as a bonus (1/2 of 9 rounded down),
provided that these units meet a 25% affordability standard (Section 585).
Now there are 13 units.
The number of affordable units required: 9 X 12% = 1.08.
25% of the 4 bonus units will need to be affordable = 1.00.
Now, there are two required affordable units at the 80% SMI level, with the remainder
being a fee-in-lieu calculated as:
The number of units required to be affordable to households at 80% of State Median
Income: 100 X .08=.08
The State Median Income for a family of four is $90,600 (2015).
The cash contribution is calculated as follows:
0.08 X $90,600 X 300% = $21,744
(see next page for another calculation example)
B. Calculating the Fee In Lieu Payment
The cash contribution provided for each dwelling unit, or fraction thereof, shall be as
follows:
(1) Units affordable to households earning 80 percent of the State Median Income (SMI)
for the State of Connecticut require a cash contribution equal to 300% of the State
Median Income for a family of four.
(2) Example: Cash contribution based on 2015 data:
The total number of on-site units proposed is five (5).
The number of affordable units required: 5 X 12% = 0.6.
The number of units required to be affordable to households at 80% of State Median
Income: 100% X 0.6 = 0.6.
Page E-2
The State Median Income for a family of four is $90,600 (2015).
The cash contribution is calculated as follows:
0.6 X $90,600 X 300% = $163,080
The total fee in lieu payment is $163,080
(Note: As of the adoption of this Regulation, the 2015 State Median Income data was the
most recent available. As time changes, this data will change. The most recent data from
HUD at the time the application is filed shall be used for this calculation).

The Regulations define the applicability of the new Section and establishes components of
Stormwater management plans.
Proposed Amendments to the Darien Subdivision Regulations put forth by the Darien Planning
& Zoning Commission. Add to Article IV Section I a new #8 requiring that all subdivisions shall
comply with the requirements for Stormwater management as outlined within Section 880 et. seq. of
the Darien Zoning Regulations.

Following careful review of the submitted application materials and related analyses, the
Commission finds:
1. The Commission proposes to create a new Section 880 et. seq. of the Darien Zoning
Regulations. The purpose of these Regulations is to require storm water management plans for
certain projects and applications. The Regulations define the applicability of the new Section
and establishes components of Stormwater management plans. The Commission also proposes
to amend the Darien Subdivision Regulations by adding to Article IV Section I a new #8
requiring that all subdivisions shall comply with the requirements for Stormwater management
as outlined within Section 880 et. seq. of the Darien Zoning Regulations.
2. These proposals to amend the Subdivision Regulations and the Zoning Regulations are put forth
by the Planning and Zoning Commission consistent with the October 24, 2008 Stormwater
Management Report and Draft Regulations prepared by Tighe & Bond.

3. These proposals have been revised compared to the original proposal dated December 19, 2008.
That original proposal was presented at the January 2009 public hearing. In response to
comments received at that public hearing, department staff worked with Town Counsel and
local professional engineers in revising the proposal. The revised proposal dated February 17,
2009 was put forth.
4. At the public hearing on this matter, Craig Flaherty, a professional engineer, explained amounts
of rainfall which comprise storm events. He noted that in recent years, an increase in local
rainfall depths has modified what comprises a 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 year storm. In
Connecticut, we are experiencing more rainfall than in the past, and that must be considered in
analyzing what comprises these storms. He noted that the University of Connecticut recently
published the document "Rainfall in Connecticut" which estimates rainfall depths over a 24-
hour period using data through the early 1990s. This more recent data from reflects a trend of
increasing precipitation that has been observed in Connecticut.
5. A letter of support of this application was received from the State of Connecticut DEP dated
March 12, 2009. The Darien Environmental Protection Commission sent comments dated
March 18, 2009. The Southwestern Regional Planning Agency (SWRPA) in a letter dated
February 24, 2009, noted that the proposed amendments do not appear to pose inter-municipal
impacts.
6. At the April public hearing, staff noted that comments were received regarding the proposal.
Also at that hearing, the Commission heard from a professional engineer and local attorney.
They suggested modifications to the proposed waiver provision (Section 888 of the Zoning
Regulations). The Commission also noted at that time that the burden of demonstrating the
appropriateness of the requested waiver should be on the applicant, not on the Commission.
7. Discussion also focused on whether studying and requiring drainage systems to attenuate the
100 year design storm is appropriate. Using the newer, more accurate numbers of how much
rain falls during a 100 year design storm is substantially greater than the amount of rain fall that
must be accommodated using the old data for a 50 year design storm. The Commission finds
that because of higher rainfalls, and the new storm sizes, that studying and possibly designing
for 100 year design storms is not appropriate and shall not be required. The Commission
believes that the new, more accurate data should be utilized and that a 50 year design storm
(using the new data) should be the minimum standard to which the drainage systems are
designed.
8. Details regarding the design standards and methods of analysis are contained within the
Department of Public Works Drainage Manual. The DPW Drainage Manual must be updated to
reflect the comments and policies of the Planning & Zoning Commission. Thus, the
Commission will establish an effective date of June 7, 2009 to allow the Department of Public
Works to modify their Manual accordingly.
9. The applicable recommendations in the 2006 Town Plan of Conservation & Development, as
previously amended, are as follows:

10. The Commission hereby finds that the proposed Amendment of the Darien Zoning Regulations
and the proposed Amendment of the Subdivision Regulations are fully consistent with the 2006
Town Plan of Conservation & Development, as amended.
11. The effective date of these Regulations is June 7, 2009. Section 8-2h of the Connecticut
General Statutes addresses the issue of zoning applications filed prior to a change in the Zoning
Regulations, and notes that an application filed with the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
not be required to comply with any change in the zoning regulations taking effect after the filing
of such application.

SECTION 880  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
Stormwater management is the practice of controlling the runoff of stormwater from a site
such that the quantity of stormwater flow does not result in a cumulative adverse impact on
PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION
ADOPTED RESOLUTION
AMENDMENTS TO THE ZONING REGULATIONS AND SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
REGARDING STORMWATER REGULATIONS
MAY 12, 2009

properties proximate to the site, or cause adverse cumulative impact downstream as a result
of the proposed development, while managing the stormwater runoff in a manner that
mitigates impacts to water quality. These regulations are intended to improve stormwater
management and give reasonable consideration to the restoration and protection of the
ecosystem and habitat of Long Island Sound as provided in Connecticut General Statutes 8-
2(b), 8-23(a), and 8-35a.
a. Conformance to Established Standards. Proposed stormwater management
plans are to conform to the technical guidance and procedures in the Town of
Darien Department of Public Works Stormwater Management and Drainage
Manual, as may be amended and to the extent not inconsistent with these
regulations.
b. Applicability. Proposals for any site meeting one or more of the following
criteria shall submit a stormwater management plan conforming to Section 882:
1) Construction of 1,000 square feet or more of impervious surface; or
2) Demolition and reconstruction or replacement of an existing residential
dwelling; or
3) Submission of any application subject to review and action by the Planning
and Zoning Commission if the activity is within the jurisdiction of that
Commission and/or by the Environmental Protection Commission (EPC) if the
activity is within the jurisdiction of the EPC.
If the proposed activity does not require the approval of either the Planning and
Zoning Commission or the Environmental Protection Commission, then any
stormwater management plan shall be submitted to the Zoning Enforcement
Officer (ZEO) with an application for a Zoning Permit or Certificate of Zoning
Compliance. The ZEO has thirty days to act on the application.
c. Impervious Surfaces. Impervious surface, for the purpose of this section is
defined as Building Coverage plus the area covered by driveways, sidewalks,
walkways, parking areas, terraces, patios, outside storage areas, loading and
unloading areas, and equipment pads.
d. Public Emergency. In order to help alleviate an emergency situation, the Public
Works Director may waive the requirement for a drainage analysis in order to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, if a public emergency has
been declared.
e. Exception for Coastal Areas. If a site is within the Towns Coastal Boundary,
and does not require formal review or action by the Planning & Zoning
Commission or Environmental Protection Commission, the requirement for a

comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan is waivedthe plan need only
address water quality impacts and mitigation.
881. Basic Components of Stormwater Management Plans
Comparative hydrology shall document no increase in downstream flooding conditions
for the 2, 10, 25, and 50 year storms on properties proximate to the site, or cause
adverse cumulative impact downstream as a result of the proposed development.
a. Upstream and Downstream Drainage Analysis. Stormwater management plans
shall take into account the upstream tributary drainage area and include a
downstream impact analysis for proposals which are likely to result in increased
runoff, or alter the flow of an existing discharge into a storm drainage system or
watercourse. The downstream impact analysis shall include analysis of a
confluence point downstream of the site where the area of the site is 10% or less
of the area of the upstream watershed and includes an assessment of potential
adverse impacts arising from the runoff.
b. Nonstructural Drainage Systems. Stormwater management plans shall include
non-structural approaches to controlling runoff to the maximum extent
practicable, promoting the infiltration of rainfall into the soil and preservation
of existing drainage patterns.
c. Stormwater Runoff Quality. Stormwater management plans shall include
measures to minimize, to the extent practicable, discharge of pollutants
including suspended sediment from the site through the use of measures that
control both the sources and minimize to the extent practicable, transport of
pollutants, including suspended sediment.
d. Conveyance System. Conveyance systems for the proposed project must be
analyzed, evaluated, designed, and constructed to accommodate existing
upstream and off-site runoff onto a site in addition to the on-site runoff from
the proposed development.
e. Outlet Locations. The runoff from proposed development sites should utilize
existing outlets to the maximum extent practicable, unless it is demonstrated
that using the existing outlet would exacerbate downstream flooding or result in
adverse impacts to downstream properties or properties proximate to the site.
The location of the new outlets is critical to avoid adverse impacts to
property(ies) proximate to the site. Such point sources shall be located such that
they do not adversely affect nearby property or structures that may be
proximate to the site and discharge to natural or manmade drainage systems
with adequate capacity to handle the anticipated flow.
f. Maintenance and Operation. Maintenance of drainage facilities and systems
constructed or modified as part of a proposed development, is the responsibility
PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION
ADOPTED RESOLUTION
AMENDMENTS TO THE ZONING REGULATIONS AND SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
REGARDING STORMWATER REGULATIONS
MAY 12, 2009

of the property owner, unless otherwise dedicated to, or the acknowledged
responsibility of, a government agency or other entity.
Stormwater management plans shall include an Operation and Maintenance
(O&M) plan which shall identify the specific drainage facilities or systems
subject to the plan, inspection methods and frequencies, and maintenance
methods and frequencies. The plan shall provide for routine maintenance such
as minor cleaning usually once or twice a year and insure that the drainage
facility or system is unimpeded and operational.
g. Licensed Professional Engineer. Stormwater management plans, reports,
calculations, and O&M plans and schedules shall be prepared, signed, and
sealed by a Professional Engineer licensed in the State of Connecticut.
h. Exceedance of Minimum Standards. Applicants are encouraged to exceed the
minimum drainage standards set forth in these regulations to increase positive
impacts in flood prone areas.
882. Documentation Requirements
Stormwater management plans and reports where required in these Regulations, as
defined in Section 880 shall include the following documentation:
a. Separate topographic contour mapping showing the existing and proposed
drainage areas at an appropriate scale.
b. Floodplain boundaries and Stream Channel Encroachment Lines as defined by
the National Flood Insurance Program and the Connecticut Department of
Environmental Protection, respectively.
c. Inventory and evaluation of on-site hydraulic structures and watercourses,
within or related to areas of proposed impact, including brooks, channels,
culverts, bridges, dams, weirs, and dikes, with information on their flow
capacity and physical condition. The limiting capacity of existing structures
may, at the option of the Director of Public Works, be used to establish the
allowable post-development peak flow rate from the site.
d. Inventory and evaluation of existing and proposed on-site stormwater storage
areas, including impoundments, riverine corridors, swamps, ponds, wetlands,
floodplains, and miscellaneous depressions.
e. Identification of peak rate of runoff under pre-development and postdevelopment
conditions from the site at each design point including those
included in the downstream impact analysis as applicable.

f. Specific documentation in support of stormwater management design shall
include, but is not limited to the following:
(1) Method used to calculate Stormwater runoff.
(2) Runoff characteristics of the property before and after development.
(3) Watershed calculations used to develop NRCS Curve Number or Rational
Method Calculations.
(4) Time of concentration calculations identifying length and slope of various
components including overland, shallow concentrated and channel flow. Time
of concentration paths shall be shown on the watershed maps.
(5) Hydrologic model input and output files for all storms evaluated.
(6) Subwatershed map delineating all contributing areas to each catch basin in a
proposed storm sewer system.
(7) Hydraulic computations for all storm drainage systems. Computations shall
show hydraulic grade line elevations and structure rim elevations.
(8) Pond and storage area stage-storage discharge calculations.
(9) Soils information, including depth to seasonally high groundwater and
permeability testing and drawdown calculations for proposed infiltration
systems.
g. A complete set of construction plans. Where storm drains are proposed in
roadways, the plans shall include storm sewer specifications and profiles.
883. Hydrologic Evaluation
Various methods are available for hydrologic modeling, with some methods more
appropriate than others. Most methods are based upon land cover and time of
concentration relationships. Hydrologic models should use methods established by the
Soil Conservation Service (now Natural Resources Conservation Service) or the United
States Army Corps of Engineers. In all cases, the 2, 10, 25, and 50 year storms shall be
evaluated for existing and proposed conditions comparative hydrology, with the same
modeling methodology used for both conditions. The Director of Public Works may
waive the requirements herein if the applicant demonstrates, in writing, why a
proposed alternate method of analysis is appropriate and adequate.
a. Basis of Existing Conditions Analysis. Existing Conditions Analysis shall account
for actual on-site conditions at the time of the proposal, accounting for all
depressions, and types of land cover, except for applications involving the
PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION

demolition of an existing residential dwelling or commercial building and
replacement of the razed structure with a new structure.
Where an existing residential dwelling or commercial building is proposed to be
razed and replaced with a new structure, the basis of existing conditions analysis
shall be the sites undeveloped condition if there is no engineered detention system
on the existing site. If there is an existing engineered detention system on the
existing site, then the actual existing conditions at the time of application shall be
used as the basis of the existing conditions analysis. The local land use board or
ZEO may require a comparison to undeveloped conditions where warranted.
b. Detention Analysis. A complete runoff hydrograph evaluation is required for
projects utilizing detention methods.
884. Peak Flow Attenuation
a. The discharge of stormwater runoff from development sites shall not result in
cumulative adverse impacts on properties proximate to the site and shall not
exacerbate downstream flooding conditions.
b. In all cases, the applicant shall perform a watershed study to document that the
proposed development will not cause adverse impacts on properties proximate
to or downstream from the site. The limit of this study will be the downstream
point at which the site represents 10% or less of the total watershed area. This
study shall be done for the 2, 10, 25, and 50 year storms.
885. Infiltration and Stormwater Quality
Infiltration shall be utilized where appropriate to reduce stormwater runoff rate and
volume, to improve stormwater quality, and to recharge groundwater. Runoff from
areas with high pollutant loadings, such as gasoline stations shall not be infiltrated. All
infiltration practices shall be subject to pretreatment with another stormwater best
management practice. The Town of Darien Department of Public Works Stormwater
Management and Drainage Manual, as may be amended, shall be used as a guide.
886. Stormwater Detention Facilities
Stormwater detention facilities to temporarily store excess runoff may be used to
control peak flow rate and duration of downstream flows when coordinated with the
runoff characteristics of the watershed in which they are located and the local site
conditions.
887. Certification and Maintenance Agreements
a. Prior to obtaining a Zoning Permit and/or starting work on a project, an O&M
plan or Notice of Drainage Maintenance Plan shall be recorded on the Darien
PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION
ADOPTED RESOLUTION

PAGE 9
Land Records. The O&M plan either filed in the Land Records or referred to
by the Notice of Drainage Maintenance Plan shall stipulate the inspection
frequency, maintenance requirements and intervals for all proposed
stormwater management practices on the site.
b. Prior to issuance by the Zoning Enforcement Officer of a Certificate of Zoning
Compliance, a Certificate of Occupancy, or use of the site, the following shall be
submitted:
(1) An improvement location survey prepared and submitted by a Connecticut
licensed land surveyor, depicting: pipe inverts, diameters and sizes, structure
inverts and elevation, and other information to adequately describe the
constructed stormwater management system. The survey shall also indicate the
extent of impervious surfaces, and topography of the completed site where
changes in grade exceed one foot.
(2) A certification by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Connecticut
stating that the proposed drainage system was installed in conformance with the
approved plans. If plans were not prepared by a professional engineer, a signed
statement by the owner shall be submitted stating that the system was installed
in substantial conformance with the approved design.
888. Waivers
a. The Planning and Zoning Commission and/or the Environmental Protection
Commission may waive one or more of the provisions in Section 880 et. seq.
under any of the following circumstances:
(1) Based upon the size and/or location of the subject property;
(2) Based upon any unique site characteristics of the subject property;
(3) Due to the scope, nature, and/or amount of work proposed within the
application;
(4) Due to any prior applications for the subject property which have
accounted for stormwater management, and those drainage structures or
facilities are still in place.
The burden is upon the applicant to demonstrate why a waiver should be

Page II-1
II. ARTICLE II  SUBDIVISION APPLICATION PROCEDURE
SECTION A. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
1. No subdivision or resubdivision of land or issuance of a permit for the erection of a structure in a proposed development shall be made, and no land in any subdivision or resubdivision shall be sold or offered for sale or lease, until a plan of subdivision, prepared in accordance with the requirements of these regulations, has been approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and has been filed in the Office of the Town Clerk. Approval of plans for subdivision or resubdivision will be given by the Commission in accordance with the requirements and procedures established by these Regulations.
In all other instances, where a division of land or adjustment of a property line is involved, the plan shall be subject to an administrative review by the Planning and Zoning Director or his official designee, who shall determine that all prevailing regulations and requirements have been complied with. A stamp signed by the Director or his designee, shall be placed upon said plan which shall then be eligible for filing within the Darien Land Records.
2. The subdivider or owner of real property shall not proceed with construction work of any kind which may affect the arrangement of streets or location of buildable areas until approval of the Subdivision Plan has been obtained from the Commission. Work shall include, but not be limited to, clearing, grubbing, excavating, grading, blasting or other similar activities.
3. Land of such geophysical nature that, in its present state, cannot be used for building purposes because of danger to health, or the public safety, because of peril from fire or flood, or other conditions, such as difficult drainage, configuration, inaccessibility, temporary flooding, erosion, steep sloping topography, wetlands, swamps, large rock outcrops, or high ground-water level, shall not be planned for residential use, nor for other such uses as may increase danger to health, life or property, or aggravate or create a flood hazard, unless appropriate measures have been taken by the subdivider to correct such hazard in accordance with the specifications declared a part of these Regulations, or the specific requirements established by the Planning and Zoning Commission, pursuant to these Regulations.
4. Before preparing and submitting an application for subdivision, the subdivider shall familiarize himself with the provisions of these Regulations, the Town Plan of Development, the Zoning Regulations and Map, the specifications setting forth requirements for street layout, construction, utility installation, and for improvement of adverse geophysical conditions.
5. All utilities within a proposed subdivision to be provided from a public source, such as water, sewer, electric service, telephone, fire hydrants and street lighting, shall be approved by the public utility having jurisdiction and the Town Engineer and shall be installed at no cost to the Town as the Commission shall approve. In general, where such public utilities are available, they shall be used in lieu of on-site facilities.
6. All proposals for on-site water supply and sewage disposal facilities shall be subject to the specific approval by the Town's Department of Health.
7. No privately owned reserve strips of land which, in the opinion of the Commission, show an intent on the part of the subdivider to control access to land dedicated or to be dedicated to public use
Page II-2
shall be permitted except where the control of the land comprising such strips is placed within the jurisdiction of the Town under conditions approved by the Commission.
8. The subdivider may develop the subdivision in progressive stages instead of in its entirety, but no subdivision or portion thereof shall be considered unless it abuts a street as defined herein and in the Zoning Regulations.

All percolation test holes, soil profile pits, and other test areas shall be numbered and located on the appropriate Construction Sheet.
Page III-6
SECTION C. ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION
The Commission, or its staff, may require that an environmental analysis be conducted for the subject property. Such requirement shall be determined by the nature of the site, the scope and nature of the proposal, and/or previously documented problems or issues in the general area. Where such environmental analysis is required, the following procedures shall be adhered to:
1. An environmental impact assessment shall first be performed for the subject area. Such assessment shall cover the potential impacts of the proposal on the site and surrounding areas including, but not limited to, considerations relative to surface and subsurface drainage, tidal or inland flooding, water quality, accelerated erosion and sedimentation, effects on vegetation, and related factors. The report must be sufficiently specific to enable the Commission to determine if a more detailed environmental impact statement may be required. All such analyses shall be prepared by a qualified professional approved, in advance, by the Commission.
2. An environmental impact statement may be specifically required where the Commission deems such statement to be necessary. It shall be prepared by a qualified professional in conformance with guidelines established by the Commission.
In general, the statement shall incorporate the following:
a) Description of property and proposal.
b) Discussion of effects upon environment.
c) Identification of adverse effects.
d) Assessment of alternatives.
e) Description of long term effects.
f) Identification of any irreversible damage which may result from the project.
g) Actions available to minimize adverse effects on the environment.
SECTION D. EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL
1. All subdivision applications shall fully consider problems of accelerated erosion and sedimentation in accordance with the standards and specifications set forth in these Regulations, the "Erosion and Sedimentation Control Handbook" prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, and other guidelines available in the Commission's office.
2. In the discretion of the Commission, or its designated agent, an applicant may also be required to submit a full erosion and sedimentation control plan concerned with all earth disturbing activities. This plan is to meet all requirements set forth in the cited handbook and other available guidelines, as the Commission may deem necessary. In addition to the written report, the mapped information set forth in ARTICLE III, Section A(4) shall be submitted.
Page III-7
3. The following criteria shall be considered in determining the appropriate devices and measures to be necessary and reasonable to prevent accelerated erosion and sedimentation:
a) exposing the smallest practical area of land at any one time during development, said exposure occurring for the shortest practical period of time.
b) maximizing the retention and protection of natural features of the land, both on-site and off-site.
c) preserving the boundaries and alignment of watercourses and wetlands, both on-site and off-site.
d) maximizing the use of temporary vegetation and mulching to protect critical areas exposed during development.
e) installing the permanent final vegetation and/or structures as soon as possible.
f) removing topsoil only from those areas intended for structures or other man-made improvements and redistributing said topsoil within the boundaries of the land being developed so as to provide a suitable base for seeding and planting. Unless specifically permitted by the Commission, topsoil shall not be removed from the site.
g) accommodating the increased runoff caused by the changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.
h) installing sediment basins wherever necessary.
i) filtering runoff from temporary and permanent roadways during construction to prevent siltation and erosion.
4. The Commission may require upon approval of a subdivision plan, where appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, the construction of silt and sediment traps, the mulching and temporary or permanent planting of areas, the construction of diversions or other devices and measures necessary to prevent accelerated erosion and sedimentation.
The Commission, or agent thereof, may also impose any additional measures and limitations at any subsequent time, whenever conditions arise which require the taking of additional precautions or imposition of controls to prevent accelerated erosion and sedimentation.
However, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant, successor or assigns to perform all earth disturbing activities in such a manner to properly comply with the intent of this section.
SECTION E. MONITORING DURING CONSTRUCTION
The Commission may require the subdivider to engage a qualified environmentalist to monitor construction/ development on the subject site to assure that all terms of the approval relative to environmental needs and factors are being adhered to properly. The environmentalist shall report to the Commission as directed.
[Page intentionally left blank]
Page IV-1
IV. ARTICLE IV  LAYOUT AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
SECTION A. NATURAL CONDITIONS
1. Preservation of Existing Topography
a) Land to be subdivided shall be designed and improved in reasonable conformity to existing topography in order to minimize required grading, cut and fill. The natural contours shall be retained, insofar as possible, to minimize storm water run-off, and conserve the natural vegetative cover and soil. [See ARTICLE III, Section A. 4.]
b) No top soil, sand or gravel shall be removed from any lots until all necessary permits shall be received from the Town of Darien and State of Connecticut, if applicable.
2. Preservation of Environmental Features
a) Due regard shall be given to the preservation and potential enhancement of irreplaceable natural features, natural drainage patterns, scenic points, trails, watercourses and other assets of a community nature through harmonious design of the subdivision.
b) A conscious effort shall be made to preserve all worthwhile trees and shrubs which exist on the site. On individual lots or parcels, care shall be given to preserve selected trees to enhance the landscape treatment of the development. In general, the following criteria shall apply to the preservation of trees:
- If a tree is of a common species, extraordinary efforts shall be made to preserve it only if it is of large size (12 inch diameter or greater) and in healthy condition.
- If a tree is of a rare species, extraordinary efforts shall be made regardless of size.
- If the tree or trees are located at an important location on the site, the design of the subdivision shall reflect requirements to preserve them. Such locations shall include, but not be limited to, street trees, noise and visual buffers, wind screens, groves and other comparable types.
c) The Commission may require additional exhibits and plans to demonstrate the means of protection for above said assets. Deed covenants, easements, or other conservation restrictions may be required to assure that proper protection shall be achieved now and in the future.
3. Relationship to Potential Flood Areas
a) New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation. The minimum first floor elevation for each lot shall be designated on the plan.
Page IV-2
SECTION B. LOT LAYOUT
1. The minimum size, shape, and other aspects of lots shall be set forth as required by the Zoning Regulations for the zone in which it is located.
2. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography, size of buildable area, or other conditions in complying with the Zoning Regulations in order to build on each lot. In no case, shall the shape of the lot or the size or location of the buildable area excessively restrict or limit the construction of future additions or placement of accessory structures.
3. No lot, regardless of size, which is rendered useless for building, according to sound engineering practice, shall be shown as a building lot on any subdivision. Such property must be included in adjoining lots or open space areas unless otherwise allowed by the Commission.
4. All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines, unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan, as determined by the Commission.
5. Corner lots shall be of sufficient dimensions so that any structure placed thereon shall conform to the building setback line of each street and adequate living area may be provided.
6. Depth of lots shall not, in general, exceed two and one-half times the width of the lot and shall not be designed to encourage the later creation of a second building lot to the rear.
7. Where possible, lots shall be so laid out that driveways have access to a local street and not to a major road carrying general traffic.
8. Lots backing upon a railroad right-of-way shall have a minimum depth of 150 feet.
9. Lots to be served by septic tanks shall be large enough to contain sufficient land of proper character to permit satisfactory performance of septic tank disposal fields, including required reserve areas. In general, where public water supply is available, such lots shall have an area of at least one-half acre, and where both private sewage disposal system and a well are to be located on the same lot, such lot should have at least one acre. These areas may be reduced, where the subdivider submits a certificate of a qualified sanitary engineer stating that the facilities as planned can be safely accommodated on the lot. The Commission shall require a report from a qualified sanitary engineer demonstrating that a suitable sanitary waste disposal system, including required reserve areas, can be provided on each lot of the proposed subdivision where lots are not to be served by public sewers. The Commission shall consider strongly the Department of Health's recommendations.
10. No land adjacent to the subdivision shall be withheld by the subdivider which is not capable of satisfactory subdivision into lots of the size required except for specified open space land.
11. If a tract being subdivided contains a waterbody, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to allocate the ownership of the waterbody among one or more adjacent lots. The Commission may approve an alternative plan whereby the ownership of any responsibility for safe maintenance of the waterbody is so placed that it will not become the Town's responsibility.
Page IV-3
12. Whenever access to a subdivision is to be provided only across land in another municipality, the Commission shall determine that a road giving such access has been legally established and that such road is adequately improved, or that a performance bond has been duly executed and is sufficient in amount to assure the construction of the road. Lot lines, wherever possible, shall be laid out so as not to cross Town boundary lines.
13. Where a tract is proposed to be subdivided into lots averaging more than double the required size under the Zoning Regulations, the Commission may require that such lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where they would be necessary to properly serve such potential lots.
14. Whenever lots of a proposed subdivision are situated within a business zone, such lots shall be of sufficient size and dimensions to permit adequate provisions for off-street loading, unloading and parking.
SECTION C. OPEN SPACE
1. An essential purpose of these Regulations is the preservation and conservation of land in a natural condition for perpetuity in order to create buffers against noise and air pollution, and to protect natural environmental systems, vegetation, wildlife, climate, scenery, natural history, areas of archaeological significance, residential privacy and natural resources, including, but not limited to, edges of watercourses, tidewaters, lakes and ponds, wherever they occur within subdivisions.
2. Every subdivision and resubdivision which encompasses land in area equal to or greater than three (3) times the minimum lot size for the Zone (s) in which located, shall be required to dedicate, as a permanent open space reservation, land not less in amount than ten percent (10%) of the aggregate area of the subdivision tract. The required dedicated open space land shall be in addition to all land required by the Zoning Regulations and the Subdivision Regulations to meet minimum lot, street, accessway and other development requirements and may be in addition to lands protected under Conservation Restrictions or Easements.
3. The required open space land shall be in a location and of a character approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, and may be required to have street frontage or an access easement determined adequate by the Commission, and shall be fully delineated on the Subdivision Plan. Required open space land shall, in addition, be consistent in location with open space shown on the adopted Town Plan of Development. A proper deed conveying the open space in perpetuity shall be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to the approval of the subdivision. The filing of this deed and the filing of the plan in the Land Records shall be simultaneous. The Planning and Zoning Commission may require that the land be deeded to an agency such as the Town Environmental Protection Commission or the Darien Land Trust, or in certain instances, to a Homeowner's Association or an individual in conjunction with a conservation restriction or easement to be held by the Land Trust or other appropriate third party.
4. Use of the reserved open space land shall generally be limited to conservation, scenic or buffer uses as determined appropriate by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Notes or other details on the plan may provide for preservation of the land in its natural character so that it shall not in the future be built upon or in any way altered.
Page IV-4
5. Legal instruments establishing the ownership and maintenance responsibility of the open space parcel or parcels shall accompany each subdivision application, and shall require approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Commission, in approving such instruments, shall specify that their text shall become binding permanent covenants and may require that conservation easements be established for education and other similar purposes that do not require altering the land. All open space shall be properly monumented.
6. In addition to permanent open space requirements, the Commission may require, as a condition of approving any plan, the use of Conservation Restrictions or Easements to protect and preserve for perpetuity those natural or unique features which enhance the character of environment of the area or which are critical to the proper use and development of an area.
SECTION D. EXISTING STREETS
These special standards are applicable only to existing streets. Streets which provide either frontage or direct access to the property being subdivided and which already exist as streets on the date of subdivision applications, shall be required to comply with the following standards:
- Where the Planning and Zoning Commission judges that the specified standards for street design can be reasonably met, and that prospective traffic needs require such improvement, the standards given shall apply, or:
- Where the Planning and Zoning Commission judges, however, that the circumstances of the existing street, and the traffic needs of the street, are such that the Town Standards cannot reasonably be fulfilled, the Commission shall require that layout and development of the existing street be provided consistent with specific standards which it shall determine in each case are adequate in that case for: safety of traffic using the roadway; adequacy of access by emergency vehicles; essential maneuvering by service and maintenance vehicles; and pedestrian safety; and in consideration of the number of dwellings or lots to be served. Such individual street standards, where adopted by the Commission, shall be binding on the applicant in lieu of the Town Standards and shall be fully inscribed on the subdivision plan.
- Waivers of such improvements may cause the roadway to be ineligible for acceptance as a public highway.
SECTION E. NEW STREET LAYOUTS
1. Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography, and all streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building sites at, or above, the grades of the streets.
2. All streets and highways shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the current Town Road Specifications.
3. Local streets shall be laid out so that their use for through traffic will be discouraged. Particular attention should be given to eliminating possible bypasses around traffic signals and major intersections.
Page IV-5
4. Where streets do not extend to the boundaries of the tract, they shall be generally separated from such boundaries of the tract, by a distance not less than the minimum lot depth prescribed by the Zoning Regulations for the zoning district in which the proposed subdivision is located.
5. Streets shall be of sufficient width, suitably located and adequately constructed to accommodate the prospective traffic, and to afford access of firefighting, snow removal, and other road maintenance equipment, and shall be coordinated so as to compose a convenient traffic system. The arrangement of streets shall be such as to cause no undue hardship to adjoining properties.
6. The arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall provide for the continuation of principal streets of adjoining subdivisions, and for proper projection of principal streets in adjoining property which is not yet subdivided, in order to make possible necessary fire protection, movement of traffic and the construction or extension, presently or when later required, of needed utilities and public services such as sewers, water and drainage facilities. Where topographic or other conditions make such continuance impractical, in the opinion of the Commission, the above requirement may be modified.
7. Minor or secondary street openings into a major road shall, in general, be at least 500 feet apart.
8. Except where impractical, all streets shall join each other so that for a distance of at least 100 feet the street is at right angles to the street it joins.
9. Cross (four-cornered) street intersections shall be avoided insofar as possible, except as shown on the Town Plan of Development or at other important intersections. A distance of at least 150 feet shall be maintained between center lines of offset intersecting streets.
10. Every attempt shall be made to conform to an overall street pattern as laid out in the Town Plan of Development or by the Commission through its own deliberations.
SECTION F. CUL-DE-SAC STREETS
1. Except where connections may be possible, dead end or cul-de-sac streets should not, in general, exceed one thousand, two hundred (1,200) feet in length nor serve more than fourteen (14) lots. They shall be equipped with a turnaround roadway at the closed end having a minimum right-of-way diameter of one hundred and thirty feet. The center circle of such cul-de-sac shall be suitably landscaped to the satisfaction of the Commission. Where there is a possibility of extension of a cul-de-sac, there shall be a notation on the Record Plan stating that all segments of the turnaround, outside the normal right-of-way, shall be returned to the record owners of adjacent properties at such time as the turnaround is eliminated. If a development includes land reverting to abutting owners, the surplus pavement shall be removed at the expense of the developer of the street extension and the area shall be regraded, topsoiled to a minimum depth of six (6) inches, and seeded.
2. The terminus of permanent cul-de-sac streets shall normally not be nearer to an adjoining property boundary than one hundred (100) feet, or the minimum lot depth prescribed by the Planning and Zoning Commission, whichever is greater. However, the Commission may require the reservation of a twenty (20) foot wide easement to accommodate drainage facilities and utilities, and a public way to accommodate pedestrian traffic.
Page IV-6
3. Under certain conditions set forth below, the Commission may authorize the provision of a Low Volume Local Residential Street, as defined in these Regulations. Such street may be constructed to separate design standards established for such street classification, but prevailing Town standards shall be adhered to with regard to construction.
SECTION G. STANDARDS FOR STREET DESIGN
1. Streets and utilities shall be graded, constructed and improved in accordance with the requirements of these Regulations and with Town standard specifications where applicable. Such construction and improvements, where required by the Planning and Zoning Commission, shall be shown on a Subdivision Construction Sheet approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Town Engineer and shall be located and built as shown on the said sheet. Such construction and improvements shall include, but not be limited to, streets and roadways, sidewalks, storm drainage facilities, curbing and guard rails, street trees and landscaping, fire hydrants, street signs and lighting, access drives to lot lines, and underground mains or conduits for water, sanitary sewer, gas, electric, and telephone services.
2. Where street widths and right-of-way conditions permit, all required utilities shall be installed underground in the right-of-way at the edge of the travel way (or pavement) of the street. Locations and depths of the proposed utility lines shall be based on the requirements of the respective utility companies or Town departments, as shown by their written approval of the subdivision's provisions, and shall be installed as shown on the subdivision construction sheet approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The subdivider shall install underground service connections to the front property line of each lot within the subdivision for all required utilities, before the street is paved.
3. Street classification may be indicated on the Town Plan of Development. Otherwise, it shall be determined by the Commission.
4. Where the subdivision borders an existing street and additional land is required for realignment or widening of such street as indicated by the Town Plan of Development or otherwise determined by the Commission to be necessary, such additional land shall either be dedicated as part of such street as indicated on the Subdivision Plan, or shall be conveyed to the Town and marked on the Plan "Reserved for Street Realignment (or Widening) Purposes".
5. Upon written request of the applicant, the Commission may classify a proposed street as a "Low Volume Local Residential" Street. This may be done only when the road meets all of the following conditions:
a) Proposed street shall not exceed eight hundred (800) feet in total length.
b) Proposed street will serve eight (8) or less building lots.
c) Proposed street will not terminate any closer than one hundred (100) feet from an existing street.
d) The Town shall not assume any responsibility or liability for maintenance, including snowplowing or repair of such street.
Page IV-7
e) Such street shall remain a private road and at no time in the future can it be accepted as a public highway unless it shall be reconstructed to meet all prevailing Town Standards.
6. Geometric standards for various road classifications shall be as follows:
Local Residential

Notes:
A. In lieu of a full sized cul-de-sac, a hammerhead or back-around may be provided. Such turning area shall have a minimum depth of sixth-five (65) feet (20 feet plus 45 feet) on each leg with a forty-five (45) foot radius at the inner intersection of the hammerhead and roadway (refer to Figure 1 on page IV-8).
B. All roadway construction shall meet the Town of Darien Department of Public Works Standards for Roads and Drainage except for roadway width.
C. Minimum shall not apply to curves at entrance to turnarounds.
D. Minimum grades of vertical curves shall be one (1) percent calculated from the PVT or PVC to the high point or low point of the curve.
Page IV-8
Figure 1
7. Streets shall be graded and improved with pavement, sidewalks, street trees, drainage facilities, water, sewers, and fire hydrants. The Commission may waive such improvements as it considers omission to be without jeopardy to the public health, safety and convenience. Such waivers may, however, render the roadway ineligible for acceptance as a public highway.
8. Street trees shall be planted on both sides of a street except where unnecessary because of existing tree growth. Trees shall generally:
a) Be spaced approximately thirty-five (35) feet apart, subject to variations made necessary by driveways and street corners as well as species of trees, and located near the front property line.
b) Have a caliper of two to two and one-half inches or larger (measured four feet above the root crown) and a height of at least eight feet, except in the case of ornamental trees such as dogwoods. The species of trees and planting specifications shall be recommended by the Commission and undesirable trees located within any street right-of-way shall be removed by the subdivider at the direction of the Commission or Town Engineer.
c) Suitable provisions shall be made to guarantee that street trees shall thrive for a period of not less than one (1) year.
9. Where topography is such as to make impractical the inclusion of utilities within the street lines, permanent easements at least fifteen (15) feet in width shall be provided across properties outside the street lines, and with satisfactory access to the street.
10. A combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided. Where the grade of a street intersecting another street exceeds five (5) percent, the land at each corner of such intersection shall be so graded as to prevent a blind corner and sufficient land shall be included in the street right-of-way at the intersection to permit permanent maintenance of visibility for traffic safety. In all cases, the first thirty (30) feet measured from the right-of-way line of the existing street shall be constructed at a one (1) percent grade.
Page IV-9
SECTION H. STREET NAMES
1. Proposed street names shall be substantially different so as not to be confused in sound or spelling with present names in the Town, except that streets that join or are in alignment with streets of an abutting or neighboring property shall bear the same name.
2. Streets shall have names and not numbers or letters such as 1st or First Street.
SECTION I. DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENTS
1. Drainage shall be designed to provide a zero increase in peak runoff by the use of retention or detention systems and the backup computations shall be provided as part of the application. A final outlet shall be provided to give actual fifty (50) year design storm capacity to insure positive drainage in case of a malfunction of the detention or retention systems.
2. A culvert or other drainage facility shall, in each case, be large enough to accommodate potential run-off from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the subdivision. The Town Engineer shall determine the necessary size of facility based on anticipated run-off from a fifty (50) year storm under the conditions of total potential development permitted in the watershed by the Zoning Regulations.
3. The Town Engineer shall also study the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. Where it is anticipated that additional run-off incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility during a fifty (50) year storm, the Commission shall not approve the subdivision until the subdivider has made such provision for the improvement of said potential condition as the Commission deems reasonable. The Commission shall notify the Board of Selectmen of such potential condition where Town facilities may be involved.
4. The developer may be required by the Commission to carry away by pipe or open swale, as determined by the Commission, any spring or surface water that may exist either previous to, or as a result of, the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall be located in the street right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width.
5. Curbs or paved gutters shall be required where the grade of a street exceeds five (5) percent.
6. All drainage improvements shall be approved as to design and specifications by the Town Engineer.
7. Where a watercourse separates a proposed street from abutting property, provision shall be made for adequate drainage under any access to a lot. Culverts or other structures of a design approved by the Town Engineer and the Environmental Protection Commission shall be installed prior to the issuance of any Certificate of Occupancy for the lot.
8. All subdivisions shall comply with the requirements for Stormwater management as outlined within Section 880 et. seq. of the Darien Zoning Regulations.
[Revised 6/7/2009]
Page IV-10
SECTION J. PRIVATE DRIVE STANDARDS
1. Private drives shall not exceed a ten percent (10%) grade.
2. The first thirty (30) feet from the edge of the paved street providing access shall not exceed a two percent (2%) grade.
SECTION K. PRIVATE RESTRICTIONS
The owner may place restrictions on the development greater than those required by the Zoning Regulations. The greater restrictions, however, shall be indicated on the plan submitted.
SECTION L. SOLAR ACCESS PROTECTION
In a subdivision where solar access is deemed desirable or necessary by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the following regulations shall be applied.
Solar access may not be necessary: 1 - On the north side of a hill, 2 - where buffer strips have been required by the Town which block solar access, 3 - where other actions taken by the Town block solar access.
1. Orientation
a) Building Orientation.
Buildings should be oriented with the long axis oriented east and west with a possible ten (10) degree variation to northwest and a possible twenty-five (25) degree variation to the southwest. This creates the best possibility that large roofs and walls may receive solar radiation.
b) Lot Orientation.
Whenever possible lot lines should be oriented so that they run east and west or north and south, which directions have the best opportunity for orienting buildings toward the sun.
c) Street Orientation.
Where the topography and soil/ledge conditions will permit, streets shall be oriented so that they run in an east-west direction. In the case of new subdivisions where the topography, soil/ledge or previous street orientation prohibits east-west orientation of new streets the layout of the lots and buildings shall be adjusted for orientation to the sun. (As in a. and b. above).
2. Vegetation Siting
a) Existing Vegetation.
In order to protect as much existing vegetation as possible and still allow for solar access, buildings should be located in that location which protects and ensures long life to the youngest and healthiest trees, bushes and plants.
Page IV-11
b) New Vegetation.
Planting plans for new development shall be submitted which ensure that no new vegetation (e.g. street trees) denies new buildings solar access. If new vegetation is planned or required, a shadow plan shall be submitted identifying location, species and shadow area at maturity.
3. Special Requirements
a) Fences and Walls.
No fences or walls shall be placed on a lot or attached to a new building which shall deny solar access.
b) Solar Surface.
Each lot must have solar access to at least one of the following: (1) roof, (2) wall, or (3) open lot.
These Regulations make every effort to provide solar access to all property. However, should the developer demur, the Planning Commission must be held harmless and that shall be noted on the approved plan.

V. ARTICLE V  COMPLETION OF SUBDIVISION APPROVAL
SECTION A. COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS
Following the Commission's approval of a subdivision plan, the subdivider shall then be required to complete, or assure the proper completion of, all improvements specified in the Commission's action approving the application in the following manners:
1. Completed Improvements
Required improvements, including the placement of specified monuments, construction of drainage or erosion control facilities, street construction and other such activities, may be completed prior to the filing of the approved plan. Otherwise, a bond shall be posted.
2. Improvements Required by Unforeseen Conditions
If it shall appear, during the course of the construction of any new road, or any change in an existing road, or any other improvements required by the Commission in connection with the final approval of the plans, profiles, and specifications thereof, that additional work, or requirements are necessary, owing to unforeseen situations such as but not limited to, side hill drainage from cuts, ledge rock, or other conditions which were not apparent at the time of the final approval by the Commission, the Commission may modify the terms and conditions of the final approval so as to require such additional bond or work to be done as may be necessary to conform to accepted engineering practices.
3. Posting of Bond
A bond to the Town, in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to the Commission, Town Engineer and the Board of Selectmen, where its jurisdiction is involved, shall be submitted. It shall be sufficient to secure to the Town the satisfactory construction and installation of the required improvements by the Town in the event of the failure of the applicant to do so within the time fixed by the Commission and specified in the bond. Such Bond:
a) May be secured by a surety company, savings account passbook or letter of credit. Such bond shall be satisfactory to the Commission and to Town Counsel as to form, sufficiency and manner of execution.
b) Shall specify the time within which all improvements shall be finished.
c) Shall provide that the surety mentioned above shall become immediately available to the Town on the date mentioned in Subsection (b) above, for application toward the completion of such required improvements as have not been completed on the said date.
d) Shall provide that fifteen (15) percent cash shall be retained by the Town for a period of one (1) or more years after the actual completion of the required improvements to assure their maintenance in adequate condition.
Page V-2
4. Improvements to be Completed Before Occupancy Is Allowed
No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued for any dwelling or other structure subject to a Building Permit, within any subdivision approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, until the Town Engineer shall certify in writing to the Building Official that all improvements required by the approved subdivision plan, to serve that section of the subdivision in which the dwelling or other structure lies, have been satisfactorily completed, except for the following:
a) Final surface treatment (wearing surface of the roadway and sidewalks).
b) Standard street sign.
c) Curb and guard rail (as required).
d) Topsoil, seeding and street trees.
e) At the discretion of the Town Engineer, such other minor installations as will not interfere with proper access and drainage, and are best deferred to final completion of all required construction.
If occupancy of any structure within a subdivision is proposed prior to completion of all required improvements, the subdivider shall show on the approved construction sheet (which is made part of the final subdivision plan) those sections which will be completed as units, as provided above, unless those sections which provide access to it or drainage from it are also satisfactorily completed.
5. Utilities
For all utilities required by the approval of the subdivision, the Commission may require assurance in writing from each public utility company whose facilities are proposed to be installed. Such written assurance shall be addressed to the Commission and include a statement, in writing, from such public utility company stating that it will make the installations necessary for the furnishing of its services within the time therein specified.
6. Maintenance Bond
In appropriate situations, the Commission may require that a bond, in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it, be secured to the Town for the construction and maintenance of such improvements, landscaping or utilities for a period to be specified in the bond.
7. Release of Bond
No bond or bonds shall be released or reduced in amount until the work covered by the bond has been inspected and certified as having been satisfactorily completed and shall be signed by a professional engineer stating the roadway, drainage, and site improvements have been constructed in accordance with Town Standards and as required in the subdivision or site plan approval and further, until the Commission has approved the reduction or release.
Page V-3
8. Extension of Bond
The applicant shall notify the Commission, in writing, of his inability to complete work within the time specified in the bond and, in such notification which shall be made immediately upon the necessity for an extension becoming apparent, shall set forth:
- detailed reasons for the inability to complete the work within the time specified in the bond.
- amount of work which has been completed.
- estimated time required to complete all work.
- a period for which extension of the bond is requested.
Any such extension shall be approved by the Commission in writing. Where necessary, because of changed conditions, the Commission may require an increase in the amount of the surety as a condition of its approval.
9. Failure to Complete Improvements
Failure to complete all required improvements within seven (7) years of the date of the Commission's approval shall result in automatic expiration of the approval in accordance with the terms of the General Statutes. This includes, but is not limited to, the construction of roads, storm drainage facilities, water and sewer lines, the setting aside of open space and recreation areas, conservation easements, installations of telephone and electric services, planting of required trees or other features. In all such situations, the Commission may, at its discretion, declare bonds to be forfeited and/or a new approval must be sought and shall be subject to all regulations and standards in effect at that time.
10. Monuments
Monuments, approved by the Town Engineer, shall be set in all streets, open space parcels and other locations in accordance with the approved plan and under the terms of this section.
SECTION B. INSPECTION
The Town Engineer, or other officials designated by the Commission, shall inspect required improvements during construction to assure their satisfactory completion, and the Commission shall require a certificate from such officials stating that all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed. If the Town Engineer finds, upon inspection, that any of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the approved plans, the applicant shall be notified and shall be responsible for completing said improvements according to specifications. If such inspections of required improvements during construction are not made, neither the applicant nor the bonding company shall be in any respect relieved of responsibilities thereby.
Page V-4
1. Notification
In order to facilitate inspection of required improvements during construction, the applicant shall notify the Town Engineer at least three (3) business days before he proceeds with each of the following stages of construction of a new street or a change of an existing street:
- Rough grading completed.
- Drainage and all other underground facilities installed, and prior to backfilling.
- Graveling and rolling being done.
- Stone base being installed with penetration and chipping of stone base.
- Surfacing being done.
The applicant shall not proceed to work on any stage subsequent to the first stage until each stage of the work is inspected and approved by the Town Engineer or other authorized inspector.
In the case of other improvements, the Town Engineer or other authorized inspector shall inspect the work at such progressive stages as he shall specify, and he shall advise the Commission that the work was inspected by him and was completed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications.
2. Prior to the signing of the Record Plan by the Chairman, a written agreement in form satisfactory to the Town authorizing the Town to enter onto land to be granted to the Town for easements or streets as shown on the subdivision plan shall be provided. This shall be done for purposes of inspecting required improvements or completing them in the event of the failure of the applicant to make, maintain or otherwise not properly finish such improvements until the Town has assumed all responsibilities for them.
SECTION C. EASEMENTS AND AGREEMENTS
1. Final Approval
All applicable grants, easements and agreements to the Town shall be approved in final form by Town Counsel.
2. Filing in Land Records
All easements, agreements, and related types of documents shall be recorded in the Land Records of the Town but not until the final subdivision plans shall have been endorsed by the Chairman or Secretary of the Commission, and filed by the applicant in the Land Records of the Town, and until any necessary action shall have been taken by any other appropriate Town body or bodies.
Generally, the recording of these instruments shall be filed with the Town Clerk simultaneously with the Record Plan for the subdivision.
Page V-5
SECTION D. DISPOSITION OF FINAL PLAN
1. Final Review and Approval
Two (2) tracing-cloth or mylar originals of the approved Subdivision Plan and supporting sheets and documents shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission office. After determining that they comply in all respects with the Commission's resolution approving the subdivision plan, the tracing-cloth or mylar originals of the subdivision plan shall be endorsed by the Chairman or Secretary of the Commission. One of these originals will be returned to the applicant.
2. Filing of the Plan
In accordance with State Law, the applicant shall file with the Town Clerk the signed original of the Subdivision Plan and related documents.
The approval of any plan not so filed shall expire ninety (90) days from the date of such approval.
