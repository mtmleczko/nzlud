SUPPLEMENTATION 
The Town of Silverthorne, Colorado Municipal Code, originally published by Colorado Code Publishing Company, will be kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
Supplements to this Code provide periodic updating through the removal and replacement of pages. This inter-leaf supplementation system requires that each page which is to be removed and replaced is identified so that the updating may be accurately accomplished and historically maintained. 
Instructions for supplementation are provided for each supplement, identified by Supplement number, date and inclusive ordinance numbers. The Instructions for posting the removal and replacement of pages must be followed and accomplished in sequence, with the most recent supplementation posted last . 
When supplementation is completed and the removal and replacement of all pages are accomplished, the Instructions should be placed under the Supplementation tab, behind this page, with the most recent Instruction sheet on top. Previous Instructions should not be removed, so that the user may refer to this tab section to verify whether the code book is fully updated with all supplements included. 
The maintenance of a Municipal Code with all supplementation is an important activity which deserves close attention so that the value of the code is maintained as a fully comprehensive compilation of the legislative ordinances of the municipality.

PREFACE 
The Town of Silverthorne, a home rule town, has published its Town Code in a format which features the following: 
The Table of Contents is the table containing each chapter and article title, with reference to page location. Preceding each chapter is a chapter table of contents, also identifying each article by the subject name provided. 
The Disposition of Ordinances Table identifies the source for the contents of the code. This table provides ordinance numbers in chronological order and location by section number for the present code contents. Thus, if there is interest in determining whether an ordinance, or a portion thereof, is contained within the code, the Disposition of Ordinances Table will provide that information. The Table of Up-to-Date Pages lists all of the current pages through the most recent supplementation. 
The Index provides references by common and legal terminology to the appropriate code sections. Cross references are provided with the Index when appropriate. 
Supplements to the code provide regular updating of the code to maintain it as a current compilation of all the legislation which has general and continuing effect. Without regular supplementation, the code would soon lose its usefulness as a complete source of the general law of the municipality. Supplementation is accomplished by the periodic publication of additions and amendments to the code.

(2)  A notice of the time and place of sale, together with a description of the property to be sold, shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the county where seizure is made or, in lieu thereof and in the discretion of the General Government Director, the notice shall be posted at the courthouse of the county where seizure is made, and in at least two (2) other places in the county.

(4)  The property shall be sold at public auction for not less than a fair minimum price, and if the amount bid for the property is less than the fair minimum price so fixed, the property may be declared to be purchased by the Town and the Town shall file a release of lien thereof. If the property is purchased by the Town, such property may be disposed of in the same manner as other Town property. 
(5)  The property may be offered first by bulk bid, then subsequently for bid singularly or by lots, and the Town or the agent may accept the higher bid.

Sec. 1-10-67. - Status of tax due in bankruptcy and receivership. 
    Whenever the business or property of any taxpayer is subject to receivership, bankruptcy or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or seized for property taxes, the total tax liability shall be a prior and preferred lien against all the property of the taxpayer. No sheriff, receiver, assignee nor other officer shall sell the property of any such taxpayer under process or order of any court, without first ascertaining from the General Government Director the amount of the total tax liability before making payment to any judgment creditor or other claimants. 
(Ord. 1994-30 §2) 
Sec. 1-10-68. - Violations, summons and complaint; penalty. 
(a)  It shall be a violation of this Article to fail to perform any applicable affirmative duty specified in this Article including, but not limited to:

(Ord. 1994-30 §2) 
Division 8 - General 

Sec. 1-10-81. - Legislative intent. 
    H.B. 1007, enacted by the Fifty-fifth Colorado General Assembly and approved by the Governor on June 6, 1985, sets forth the collection of sales and use taxes by home rule cities. This Article contains provisions which are consistent with some of those set forth in H.B. 1007. The Town Council finds that Article XX of the Colorado Constitution grants plenary power to home rule cities to levy and collect taxes within the Town limits. The Town Council does not endorse restrictions on the taxing power of home rule cities. It is the intent of the Town Council in enacting provisions consistent with H.B. 1007 to assist the business community, but not in any way to prejudice the Town's right to fully exercise its constitutional authority to levy and collect taxes within its boundaries. 
(Ord. 1994-30 §2) 
Sec. 1-10-82. - Sales tax licenses; application and content. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in the business of selling retail within the Town without having first obtained a Town sales tax license. 
(b)  Persons for whom a license is required shall first submit an application stating the name and address of the person requesting such license; the name of the business being licensed and the character thereof; the location, including the street number of such business; and such other information as may be required by the General Government Director. 
(c)  Licenses shall be in effect through the end of the period for which they were issued; they shall be conditionally renewed upon renewal of the Town business license and the attendant payment of any and all appropriate Town business occupation taxes and Town sales taxes. 
(d)  Each sales tax license shall be numbered and shall show the name, location, mailing address and character of business of the licensee and shall be posted in a conspicuous place at the business location for which it is issued. 
(e)  No sales tax license shall be transferable. The new owner shall apply for a new license within thirty (30) days after any sales of a business. 
(Ord. 1994-30 §2; Ord. 1996-11 §4) 
Sec. 1-10-83. - Sales tax licenses; cancellation. 
(a)  The General Government Director may cancel any license: 
(1)  Upon receipt of a written notice that the taxpayer is no longer engaged in business in the Town; 
(2)  Upon the taxpayer's failure to respond to three (3) consecutive notices of delinquency. The General Government Director shall give notice to the taxpayer that the license has been canceled. 
(3)  After a reasonable notice and a full hearing, the General Government Director may issue a finding and order to cancel the license of any taxpayer found to have violated any provision of this Article. 
(b)  Appeal. Any person may appeal a finding and order canceling their license to the County District Court, pursuant to Rule 106(a)(4) of the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure. 
(c)  No taxpayer shall continue to engage in business in the Town after their license has been canceled. 
(Ord. 1994-30 §2) 
Sec. 1-10-84. - Transient/temporary vendors. 
(a)  Transient/temporary vendors are subject to and shall comply with the Town business license and shall pay the appropriate Town business occupation taxes as provided for elsewhere in this Code, in addition to obtaining a Town sales tax license as provided in Sections 1-10-82 through 1-10-84. 
(1)  Its provision may not be relieved by a temporary association with another licensed entity unless that entity is a charitable organization based within the Town which wishes to sponsor the transient/temporary vendor and thereby exempt the vendor from the provisions of this Section for sales which are infrequently conducted for which the charitable organization collects sales tax due in accordance with the provisions of this Article. 
(2)  Issuance of a license under this Article does not in any way relieve a transient/temporary vendor from responsibility for obtaining permission from respective property owners to set up displays and sell goods on private property; nor does it relieve such a vendor from paying required fees to charitable organizations which are conducting a special event when the vendor wishes to conduct sales in association with that event. 
(3)  Transient/temporary vendors will not be issued a sales tax license to sell unless application is received in the General Government Department at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of selling in the Town; the issuance of a sales tax license by the Town does not relieve the applicant from any of the requirements of the Town business license. The review process required by the Town prior to issuing a business license will require a longer period of time than that required to issue a sales tax license. 
(b)  Any charitable organization which organizes or sponsors an event where transient/temporary vendors are expected to conduct sales, shall be required to distribute to all participation vendors, a packet of information furnished by the Town which shall inform said vendors of requirements and procedures to be met before sales in the Town may be conducted. 
(c)  Tax deposit required. Unless waived or reduced by the General Government Director, transient/temporary vendors shall deposit with the General Government Director a minimum of one hundred dollars ($100.00), or such greater amount as the General Government Director may direct. The deposit shall be in cash or equivalent acceptable to the General Government Director which can be applied toward any imposed retail sales tax due on sales within the Town limits. Tax returns reflecting actual tax due must be completed within ten (10) days from the final date of sale. In no event shall the vendor be relieved of his or her obligation to remit sales tax due under this Article. The vendor may apply the deposit toward any tax owed. In the event that the signed return is not received by the General Government Director within ten (10) days from the final date of sale, the vendor shall waive the right to apply the deposit to the tax owed, and the deposit shall become nonrefundable. 
(Ord. 1994-30 §2; Ord. 1995-1 §1; Ord. 1996-11 §5) 
Sec. 1-10-84.5. - Special events sales tax license and collections. 
(a)  No special event may be conducted without the issuance of a special events license to the organizer of the event. The individual vendors participating in a special event need not individually obtain a license if a special events license has been issued to the organizer of the special event. If there is no special events organizer, the vendors at the special event must obtain their own sales tax license and collect and remit the tax to the Town pursuant to this Article X. The organizer shall remit all taxes collected by the vendors who have a license but who elect to have the organizer remit the tax. 
(b)  No later than ten (10) days after the end of the special event, the special event organizer shall provide the Finance Director with a list of the names and addresses of all vendors of the special event, and a list of all tax license numbers of vendors who have obtained their own licenses for the event and are remitting the tax to the Town independently. 
(c)  Vendors or organizers of a special event must remit the sales tax they collect pursuant to Section 1-10-10 and complete a tax schedule on a form provided by the Finance Director. 
(Ord. 2002-2 §5) 
Sec. 1-10-85. - Sales by charitable organizations.

(c)  Distribution. The distribution of all retail sales taxes shall be in the Town's Governmental Fund. The Town shall pay for all costs of administration and collection of sales taxes levied in accordance with this Article from all sources of revenue. 
(Ord. 1994-30 §2; Ord. 1996-11 §6) 
Sec. 1-10-87. - Map, location or electronic guide of Town boundaries. 
(a)  The General Government Department shall make available to any requesting vendor a map or location guide showing the boundaries of the Town. The requesting vendor may rely on such map or location guide and any update thereof available to such vendor in determining whether to collect a sales tax. 
(b)  Any vendor that collects and remits sales tax to the Town may use an electronic database of state addresses that is certified by the Colorado Department of Revenue pursuant to Section 39-26-105.3, C.R.S. to determine the jurisdictions to which tax is owed. 
(c)  Any vendor that uses the data contained in an electronic database certified by the Colorado Department of Revenue pursuant to Section 39-26-105.3, C.R.S. to determine the jurisdictions to which tax is owed; or map or location guides provided by the Town and any update thereof available to such vendor in determining whether to collect a sales tax; shall be held harmless for any tax, penalty or interest owed the Town that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an error in the map, location or electronic database guide, provided that the vendor demonstrate that it used the most current information available in such map, location or electronic database guide on the date that the sale occurred. Each vendor shall keep and preserve such records as prescribed by the General Government Department to demonstrate that it used the most current information available on the date that the sale occurred. Notwithstanding the above, if error in collecting and remitting is a result of a deceptive representation, a false representation or fraud, the provisions of this Section shall not apply. 
(Ord. 1994-30 §2; Ord. 2007-14 §1) 
Sec. 1-10-88. - Transactions and items subject to tax.

Sec. 1-10-92. - Intercity claims for recovery. 
    The intent of this Section is to streamline and standardize procedures related to situations where tax has been remitted to the incorrect municipality. It is not intended to reduce or eliminate the responsibilities of the taxpayer or vendor to correctly pay, collect and remit sales taxes to the Town. 
(1)  As used herein, claim for recover means a claim for reimbursement of sales tax from another jurisdiction. 
(2)  When it is determined by the Director of General Government of the Town that sales tax owed to the Town has been reported and paid to another taxing jurisdiction, the Town shall promptly notify the vendor that taxes are being improperly collected and remitted, and that as of the date of the notice the vendor must cease improper tax collections and remittances. 
(3)  The Town may make a written claim for recover directly to the municipality that received a tax or penalty and interest owed to the Town; or, in the alternative, may institute procedures for collection of the tax from the taxpayer or vendor. The decision to make a claim for recover lies in the sole discretion of the Town. Any claim for recover shall include a properly executed release of claim, from the taxpayer and vendor releasing its claim to the taxes paid to the wrong taxing jurisdiction, evidence to substantiate the claim, and a request that the taxing jurisdiction approve or deny in whole or in part, the claim within ninety (90) days of its receipt. The taxing jurisdiction to which the Town submits a claim for recover may, for good cause, request an extension of time to investigate the claim, and approval of such extension by the Town shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(4)  Within ninety (90) days after receipt of a claim for recover, the Town shall verify to its satisfaction whether or not all or a portion of the tax claimed was improperly received, and shall notify the taxing jurisdiction submitting the claim in writing that the claim is either approved or denied in whole or in part, the Town shall remit the undisputed amount within the thirty (30) days of approval. If a claim is submitted jointly by another taxing jurisdiction and a vendor or taxpayer, the check shall be made to the parties jointly. Denial of a claim for recovery may only be made for good cause. 
(5)  The Town may deny a claim on the grounds that it has previously paid a claim for recover arising out of an audit of the same taxpayer. 
(6)  The period subject to a claim for recover shall be limited to the thirty-six-month period prior to the date the taxing jurisdiction that was wrongly paid receives the claim for recovery. 
(Ord. 1994-30 §2) 
Sec. 1-10-93. - Effective date. 
    This Article X shall be effective on and after July 1, 1995.

Division 9 - Enhanced Sales Tax Incentive Program 

Sec. 1-10-101. - Program established; purpose. 
    There is hereby established within the Town an enhanced sales tax incentive program ("ESTIP"). The purpose of the enhanced sales tax incentive program is to encourage establishment and/or substantial expansion of retail-sales-tax-generating businesses within the Town, thereby stimulating the economy of and within the Town, providing employment for the residents of the Town and others, expanding the goods available for purchase and consumption by residents of the Town, and increasing the sales taxes collected by the Town. These increased sales tax collections will enable the Town to provide expanded and improved municipal services while at the same time providing public or public-related improvements at no cost, or at deferred cost, to the Town and its taxpayers and residents. 
(Ord. 2001-08 §1) 
Sec. 1-10-102. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this Division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this Section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. 
    Enhanced sales tax shall mean the amount of sales tax collected by the Town, and available to the Town after the deduction of sixty percent (60%) of the two-percent Town sales taxes required by election, over and above a base amount negotiated and agreed upon by the applicant and the Town, and which amount is approved by the Town Council. This base amount shall never be lower than the amount of sales taxes collected by the Town at the property in question in the twelve (12) months prior to the date the ESTIP Agreement is executed plus a reasonable and agreed-upon percentage of anticipated increase in sales taxes, or, in the case of a newly established business, an amount which represents the good faith determination by the applicant and the Town as to the amount of sales taxes which could be generated from the new business without the participation by the applicant in the ESTIP. As an illustration only: 
Total sales during a 
one-month period: $100,000 Sales tax available to Town:  Town 2% of sales $ 2,000  County 2% of sales $ 2,000  Town sales tax (gross) 4% of sales $ 4,000 Less:  Restricted portion of 
sales tax 1.2% of sales $(1,200)  Total sales tax (net) 2.8% of sales $ 2,800 Less:  Agreed sales tax base (existing taxes Town receives, i.e. 10% of gross) $ (400)  Total amount of Enhanced Sales Tax $ 2,400  Up to 50% available to share under ESTIP $ 1,200  
    ESTIP means the enhanced sales tax incentive program created by this Division. 
    ESTIP Agreement means the signed agreement between the applicant and the Town, which implements the ESTIP for a specific project or property. 
    Owner shall mean the record owner of the real property upon which one (1) or more businesses is operated. 
    Tenant shall mean the record operator of a business located in a commercial district in the Town. 
(Ord. 2001-08 §1; Ord. 2011-12 §1) 
Sec. 1-10-103. - Participation. 
    Participation in ESTIP shall be based upon approval by the Town Council exercising its sole and exclusive discretion. Any owner of a newly established retail-sales-tax-generating business or location, or the owner of an existing retail-sales-tax-generating business or location which wishes to expand substantially, which newly established or substantial expansion is accomplished subsequent to the effective date of this Division, may apply to the Town for inclusion within the ESTIP, provided that the new or expanded business is reasonably likely to generate enhanced sales taxes of at least five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) in the first year of operation. 
(Ord. 2001-08 §1; Ord. 2011-12 §1) 
Sec. 1-10-104. - Approval of agreement; use of funds generally. 
    Approval by the Town Council of an ESTIP Agreement entitles the applicant to share in enhanced sales taxes derived from the applicant's property or business in an amount which shall not in any event exceed fifty percent (50%) of the enhanced sales taxes. The applicant may use such amount solely for public and/or public-related purposes such as those specified herein and which are expressly approved by the Town Council as a part of the ESTIP Agreement. The time period in which the enhanced sales taxes may be shared shall not commence until all public or public-related improvements are completed, and may be limited to a specified time, or until a specified amount is reached. 
(Ord. 2001-08 §1) 
Sec. 1-10-105. - Eligible uses. 
    The uses eligible for the shared enhanced sales taxes shall be strictly limited to those which are public or public-related in nature. For the purposes of this Division, but not by way of limitation, public or public-related purposes shall mean environmental remediation improvements such as streets, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, pedestrian malls, street lights, drainage facilities, snow storage areas, demolition and site restoration for redevelopment, landscaping, decorative structures, enhanced architectural features, public transportation improvements, road and street improvements including traffic control signals, statuaries, fountains, identification signs, traffic safety devices, bicycle paths, off-street parking facilities, benches, public restrooms, information booths, public meeting facilities and all necessary, incidental and appurtenant structures and improvements, installation of utility lines and facilities and relocation extension and improvement of existing utility lines and facilities and any other improvements of a similar nature which are specifically approved by the Town Council upon a finding that said improvements are public or public-related improvements. Public or public-related purposes shall also include redevelopment of existing properties, occupancy of existing vacant space and expansion or creation of jobs in the Town. In the event the applicant is reimbursed for the cost of such improvements from other public funds and/or grants, the amount eligible under the ESTIP program shall be decreased by the amount of such reimbursement. 
(Ord. 2001-08 §1; Ord. 2011-12 §1) 
Sec. 1-10-106. - Increments; sharing of funds. 
    The base figure for sales taxes shall be divided into twelve (12) monthly increments, which shall be reasonably related to the average monthly performance of the business or property in question or similar businesses in the area (i.e., adjusted for seasonal variations). If in any month the agreed-upon figure is not met by the applicant so as to create enhanced sales tax for that month, no funds shall be shared with the applicant for that month, and no increment shall be shared until that deficit, and any other cumulative deficit, has been met, so that at the end of any twelve-month cycle, funds in excess of those enhanced sales taxes agreed to be shared shall not have been shared by any applicant. The Town reserves the right to select larger increments of time, including but not limited to quarterly, biannual and annual, in lieu of the monthly increments provided for in this Section. 
(Ord. 2001-08 §1; Ord. 2011-12 §1) 
Sec. 1-10-107. - Revenues restricted. 
    It is an overriding consideration and determination of the Town Council that existing sources of Town sales tax revenues shall not be used, impaired or otherwise affected by this enhanced sales tax incentive program. Therefore, it is hereby conclusively determined that only enhanced sales taxes generated by the properties or tenants described in an application shall be subject to division under this ESTIP. The Town shall collect and hold all such enhanced sales taxes in a separate account apart from the sales taxes generated by and collected from the other sales-tax-generating uses and businesses within the Town and to provide an accounting system which accomplishes the overriding purpose of this Section.

(3)  A statement that the agreement is personal to the applicant, is not transferable and does not run with the land or subsequent tenant.

Sec. 1-10-110. - No joint venture; liability. 
    The Town Council has enacted this ESTIP as a joint benefit to the public at large and to private owners and tenants for the purposes of providing the Town with increased sales tax revenues generated upon and by properties improved as a result of this program. The Town Council further finds that the public benefits of this ESTIP include public improvements and public-related improvements being completed by private owners or tenants through no debt obligation being incurred on the part of the Town, and allowing the applicant an opportunity to improve properties which generate sales activities, which improvements make those properties more competitive in the marketplace and further provide to the applicant additional contingent sources of revenues for upgrading such properties. The Town Council specifically finds and determines that creation of this ESTIP is consistent with the Town's powers as a home rule municipal corporation and that exercise of such powers in the manner set forth herein is in furtherance of the public health, safety and welfare. Notwithstanding any provision hereof, the Town shall never be a joint venturer in any private entity or activity which participates in this ESTIP, and the Town shall never be liable or responsible for any debt or obligation of any participant in this ESTIP.

(f)  Conduct of hearing. 
(1)  A hearing shall be conducted before a hearing officer designated by the Town Manager within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of a written demand therefor from the person seeking the hearing, unless such person waives the right to a speedy hearing. Saturdays, Sundays and Town holidays are to be excluded from the calculation of the forty-eight-hour period. The hearing officer shall be someone other than the person who directed the impounding and storage of the vehicle. The sole issue before the hearing officer shall be whether there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question. Probable cause to impound shall mean such a state of facts as would lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe that there was sufficient breach of local, state or federal law to grant legal authority for the removal of the vehicle. 
(2)  The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The person demanding the hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that such person has the right to possession of the vehicle. The Police Department shall carry the burden of establishing that there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a written decision. A copy of such decision shall be provided to the person demanding the hearing and the registered owner of the vehicle (if not the person requesting the hearing). The hearing officer's decision in no way affects any criminal proceeding in connection with the impound in question, and any criminal charges involved in such proceeding may only be challenged in the appropriate court. The decision of the hearing officer is final. Failure of the registered or legal owner, or his or her agent, to request a hearing within the time set forth at Subsection (1) above or attend a scheduled post-seizure hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to such hearing. 
(3)  Decisions of the hearing officers and their effect. The hearing officer shall only determine that as to the vehicle in issue either there was probable cause to impound the vehicle or there was no such probable cause. In the event that the hearing officer determines that there was no probable cause, the hearing officer shall prepare and date a certificate of no probable cause, copies of which shall be given to the possessor of the vehicle and the Police Department. Upon receipt of the possessor's copy of such certificate, the operator having custody of the vehicle shall release the vehicle to its possessor. Upon a finding of no probable cause, towing and storage fees shall be paid by the Town in accordance with arrangements made between the Town and the operator. If the possessor fails to present such certificate to the operator having custody of the vehicle within twenty-four (24) hours of its receipt, excluding such days when the operator is not open for business, the possessor shall assume liability for all subsequent storage charges. Such certificate shall advise the possessor of such requirement.

The owner shall repair, correct or replace, at his or her own cost, any pipe, fixture or appliance found to allow excessive infiltration or that does not comply with any law or regulations of the Town or the State. 
(h)  Pretreatment and flow-equalizing facilities. Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided or required for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his or her expense. 
(i)  Authority for sewer service shutoff. The Public Works Director may cause the main sewer line to be shut off when he or she deems it necessary for making connections or extensions to the same or for cleaning the same. Upon the determination by the Public Works Director that any sewer main is defective or does not comply with any law or regulation of the Town or the State, the line so determined to be defective or in noncompliance shall be shut off and replaced or repaired by the Town. 
(j)  Procedure for service shutoff. 
(1)  If at any time the Public Works Director ascertains that the plumbing fixtures, pipes or appliances from the main line to and on any premises are so defective as to allow excessive infiltration or do not comply with any law or regulation of the Town or State, it shall be his or her duty to immediately notify the owner of the premises connected to the sewer service or his or her agent or the user of such service to repair or replace the same, and if the same are not repaired or replaced within the time specified in such notice, said time being that amount reasonably calculated by the Public Works Department to allow completion of such repair or replacement, but in any event not less than seventy-two (72) hours from the time of such notice being served, mailed or otherwise delivered to the owner, agent or user, the Public Works Director shall shut off the water service line to the property. 
(2)  It is unlawful for any person to fail or refuse to comply with the order provided for in this Section. 
(k)  Failure of owner to repair, cost assessment. If any owner fails to make such repairs or replacement within the time specified, it shall be the duty of the Public Works Department to proceed at once upon the expiration of the specified time to cause such repairs or replacement to be made and to immediately report the cost and expense thereof and the legal description and the name of the record owner of the property involved to the Town Clerk. The Town shall forthwith, in writing, notify the owner of the amount of such charges, and the same shall be due and payable thirty (30) days after the date of mailing of the notice of charges. 
(l)  Cost liability; property lien. The owner of any property or premises affected by the procedures set forth in Subsections (j) and (k) above shall be held personally liable for any and all charges imposed under the provisions of this Article. These charges shall become and remain a lien upon such property or premises until paid. Such charges may be collected from the owner by an action in the name of the Town, and said action may be for the enforcement of said lien. 
(m)  Any person who, without permit, allows any nonapproved or additional property to be served by using the existing sewer service line shall be liable for then-existing tap fees plus accrued sewer service fees from the time of the earliest sewer connection of the existing service line, plus any other lines, late charges or penalties for late payment set forth herein. 
(Prior code 158-14; Ord. 1995-1 §1) 
Sec. 3-3-12. - Permit requirements, procedures and fees. 
(a)  Permit required. It shall be unlawful for any person to uncover, make any connection with or opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the Town. 
(b)  Classes; fees. 
(1)  There shall be two (2) classes of building sewer permits: for residential and commercial service and for service to establishments producing industrial wastes. In either case, the owner or his or her agent shall make application on a special form furnished by the Town. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information considered pertinent to an evaluation of the application in the judgment of the Public Works Director. 
(2)  System development fee. There shall be a minimum system development (tap) fee payable to the Town as set forth in Appendix A to this Code. An additional fee shall be paid for any property requiring more than one (1) equivalent residential unit. Such fee shall be equal to the number of equivalent residential units greater than one (1) times the minimum system development fee. The fees shall be paid at the time of building permit issuance. 
(3)  Abatement after one (1) year. Any system development fee paid pursuant to this Article shall entitle the permittee thereunder to connect to the sewer system only so long as such connection is made within one (1) year after the date of issuance of the permit and payment of the fee. Failure to connect within such one-year period shall result in an automatic revocation of the permit. After such one-year period, the permittee may connect to the sewer system only upon payment of any additional fees caused by any intervening increase in system development fees. If connection should be allowed without collection of the additional fee, such additional amounts will be added to any monthly service fee which may be due or become due and may be collected as a past-due service fee. Continued failure to pay such additional fee shall result in discontinuance of service until such fee is paid. 
(4)  Expanded use. Any property to which an additional use is to be added, so that the connected equivalent residential units will be increased, including but not limited to a residential apartment as defined in Section 4-6-53 of this Code, must pay a system development fee prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or use of the expanded facility or premises. Failure to pay the additional fee shall result in termination of service. The additional system development fee is to be in the amount obtained by multiplying the number of additional equivalent residential units by the basic unit system development fee. 
(5)  Reduced use. In the event the sewage discharge of a property is to be permanently reduced below current levels, the owner of such property may either: 
a.  Continue to pay service charges at the current rate and remain entitled to the EQR at that level; or 
b.  Propose to sell back to the Town the excess EQR at one-half (1/2) the current system development fee rate or sell back a portion of the excess EQR at one-half (1/2) the current system development fee and pay the full service charge applicable to the reduced use. The Public Works Director will make the determination on a case-by-case basis whether the Town will accept the proposal. 
(6)  Connection charge. The system development fee described at Subsection (b)(2) reflects equity values in the Town's system and results in the customers' right to tap and use the facilities. In addition to this fee, there is hereby established a connection charge in an amount as needed to cover the actual cost of making the physical connection to the Town's system. The connection charge shall include provision of the sewer tap and the actual tapping of the Town's main by Town personnel and inspection of the sewer service line by Town personnel. Any sewer tap over four (4) inches in diameter shall be contracted by the customer and performed under the supervision of Town personnel. 
(7)  Any residential apartments for which building permits or certificates of occupancy are neither applied for nor issued shall be charged the full system development fee in effect at the time of the apartment's discovery, plus any service fees which the Town or Municipal Court may determine to be due. Failure to pay such fees upon demand by the Town shall be cause for termination of all water and sewer service to the principal residence as well as the residential apartment. 
(c)  Building permit required. Application for a sewer connection permit shall be made to the Town on a form that shall be provided by the Town. No application for such permit for any new building shall be complete unless it is accompanied by a valid building permit issued for said building and, in the case of property for which building permits are not issued by the Town, by plans showing the proposed construction in detail judged sufficient by the Public Works Department. 
(d)  Deposits; back charges. No sewer service may be obtained until the applicant's payments are made at the office of the Town Clerk. No sewer service will be available until all back charges are paid. 
(Prior code 158-15; Ord. 1995-1 §1; Ord. 1998-5 §1; Ord. 1999-14 §10) 
Sec. 3-3-13. - Rates and charges. 
(a)  Basis of charges. Sewer tap fees and sewer service charges shall be based on an equivalent residential unit (EQR), flat-rate basis, as set forth in Section 3-2-1. 
(b)  Establishment of billing. Every building, property or other premises to which sewer service is rendered or proposed to be rendered shall be assigned a total EQR value based on its sewer use classifications. The Town shall determine from time to time the use or uses to which any building, property or other premises is being put in relation to sewer use classifications. Based on such determination, the Town shall make any adjustments in the assigned total EQR value of the building, property or other premises the Town may deem necessary or advisable to maintain an equitable use-to-service charge ratio. For billing purposes, the total EQR value assigned multiplied by the appropriate service rate establishes the billing. In no event shall any person, building, premises or property be billed for less than one and zero-tenths (1.0) EQR. 
(c)  The rates and charges for service shall be as set forth in Appendix A to this Code. 
(d)  The senior citizen rate for sewer service set forth in Appendix A shall be available upon presentation of evidence of age of sixty-five (65) years or more and proof of primary residence within the Town. The senior citizen rate is limited to one (1) residence within the corporate limits of the Town which must be the primary place of residence of the person applying for the rate. 
(e)  User surcharge system. The Town will assess a surcharge rate for all nonresidential users discharging wastes with biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids strengths greater than the average residential user. Such users will be assessed a surcharge sufficient to cover the costs of treating such user's above-normal strength wastes. Normal strength wastes are three hundred thirty (330) milligrams per liter of both BOD and suspended solids. The surcharge rate structure for such above-normal strength waste discharges shall be determined by the Public Works Director. 
(f)  Sewer opportunity fee. Any areas outside the Town limits which are proposed to be annexed to the Town or otherwise receive sewer service and which do not have reserved capacity in the Silverthorne-Dillon Joint Sewer Authority treatment plant shall pay a sewer opportunity fee as set forth in Appendix A of this Code. 
(g)  Review of wastewater service charges. The Town shall periodically review total annual cost of operation and maintenance as well as each user's wastewater contribution percentage (determined and expressed in EQRs), and will revise the system as necessary to assure equity of the service charge system as established herein and to assure that sufficient funds are obtained to adequately operate and maintain the wastewater treatment works. If a significant user, such as an industry, has completed in-plant modifications which would change that user's wastewater contribution percentage, such user may present to the Public Works Department information describing the modifications, and the Public Works Department shall then determine if the user's wastewater contribution percentage is to be changed and shall notify the user thereof.

(Prior code 187-18; Ord. 1995-1 §1; Ord. 1999-14 §12) 
Sec. 3-4-16. - System development fees and connection charges. 
    System development fees, inspection and connection fees for water shall be computed as follows: 
(1)  There shall be a minimum system development fee for the first equivalent residential unit or portion thereof; additional system development fees shall be paid in an amount equal to the total number of equivalent residential units greater than one (1) multiplied by the minimum system development fee. 
(2)  System development fee. There shall be a minimum system development (tap) fee payable to the Town in the amount set forth in Appendix A to this Code. The fees shall be paid at the time of building permit issuance. 
(3)  Water service to property for which system development fees have been paid must be connected within one (1) year of the date of payment of such system development fees. Failure to make such connection within a one-year period will require payment of any increase in system development fees before such connection can be made. 
(4)  Any property to which any additional use is to be or has been added, including, but not limited to, residential apartments as defined by Section 4-2-1 of this Code, shall be assessed an additional system development fee prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or use of the expanded facility or premises. Failure to pay the additional fee shall result in the termination of water service to the primary as well as the secondary residence if both are owned by the same person or persons. The additional fee is to be in the amount obtained by multiplying the number of additional equivalent residential units by the basic unit system development fee then in effect. If, however, a building permit was obtained before the additional use was added to the property, or written permission for such addition was granted by the Town, then the system development fee to be paid shall be that in effect at the time the building permit was issued or such permission was granted. 
(5)  Reduced use. In the event the water use of a property is to be permanently reduced below current levels, the owner of such property may either: 
a.  Continue to pay service charges at the current rate and remain entitled to the EQR at that level; or 
b.  Propose to sell back to the Town the excess EQR at one-half (1/2) the current system development fee rate or sell back a portion of the excess EQR at one-half (1/2) the current system development fee and pay the full service charge applicable to the reduced use. The Public Works Director will make the determination on a case-by-case basis whether the Town will accept the proposal. 
(6)  Connection charge. The system development fee that is described in Subsection (1) above reflects equity values in the Town's system and results in the customer's right to tap and use the facilities. In addition to this fee, there is hereby established a connection charge in an amount as needed to cover the actual cost of making the physical connection to the Town's system. The connection charge shall include provision of the water tap and the actual tapping of the Town's main by Town personnel and inspection of the water service line by Town personnel. 
(7)  Any residential apartments for which building permits or certificates of occupancy are neither applied for nor issued shall be charged the full system development fee in effect at the time of the apartment's discovery, plus any service fees which the Town or Municipal Court may determine to be due. Failure to pay such fees upon demand by the Town shall be cause for termination of all water and sewer service to the principal residence as well as the residential apartment. 
(8)  Water service outside Town limits. Nothing in this Article shall obligate the Town to furnish water service to any property outside the corporate limits of the Town nor otherwise limit or restrict the Town's authority to set conditions on, assess additional charges and fees for and, in all other regards, regulate use of the Town's water system.

Secs. 3-4-20-3-4-30. - Reserved. 
Division 2 - Cross-Connection and Backflow Control 

Sec. 3-4-31. - Policy and purpose. 
    The policy and purpose of this Article is: 
(1)  To protect the public water systems from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within its customers' internal distribution systems or its customers' private water systems such contaminants or pollutants which could backflow or backsiphon into the public water systems. 
(2)  To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections, actual or potential, between its customers' in-plant potable water systems and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures and industrial piping systems. 
(3)  To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of the potable water system. 
(Prior code 187-29) 
Sec. 3-4-32. - Control requirements. 
(a)  Water system. 
(1)  The water system shall be considered as made up of two (2) parts: the Town system and the customer system. 
(2)  The Town system shall consist of the source facilities and the distribution system and shall include all those facilities of the water system under the complete control of the Town, up to the point where the customer's system begins. 
(3)  The source shall include all components of the facilities utilized in the production, treatment, storage and delivery of water to the distribution system. 
(4)  The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the customer's system. 
(5)  The customer's system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the Town distribution system which are utilized in conveying Town-delivered domestic water to points of use. 
(b)  Policy. 
(1)  No water service connection shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by state laws and regulation and this Article. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the Town if a backflow prevention device, required by this Article, is not installed, tested and maintained or if it is found that a backflow prevention device has been removed, bypassed or if an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. 
(2)  The customer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the Town to determine whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the Town Manager shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the conditions in conformance with state and Town statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. 
(3)  An approved backflow prevention device shall be installed depending on degree of hazard. Such a device shall be installed at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served but, in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist: 
a.  In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable as an additional source by the Town, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard. 
b.  In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system which have been subject to deterioration in quality. 
c.  In the case of premises having internal cross-connections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled or intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line. 
(4)  The type of protective device required under Subsection (3)a, b and c above shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows: 
a.  In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply, as stated in Subsection (3)a above, and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principal backflow prevention device. 
b.  In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly. 
c.  In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principal backflow prevention device. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants. 
d.  In the case of any premises where there are uncontrolled cross-connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow prevention device at the service connection. 
e.  In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow or backsiphonage from the premises by the installation of a backflow prevention device in the service line. In this case, maximum protection will be required, that is, an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principal backflow prevention device shall be installed in each service to the premises. 
(5)  Any backflow prevention device required herein shall be of a model and size approved by the State Health Department. The term approved backflow prevention device shall mean a device that has been established by the American Water Works Association, entitled AWWA C506-78, Standards for Reduced Pressure Principal and Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Devices, and have met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research of the University of Southern California, established by Specifications of Backflow Prevention Devices, No. 69-2, dated March 1969, or the most current issue. Said American Water Works Association and Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research standards and specifications have been adopted by the agency. Final approval shall be evidenced by a certificate of approval issued by an approved testing laboratory certifying full compliance with said American Water Works Association standards and Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research specifications. The following testing laboratory has been qualified to test and certify backflow preventers: Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research, University of Southern California, University Park, Los Angeles, California, 90007. Testing laboratories other than the laboratory listed above will be added to an approved list as they are qualified by the Town Manager. Only approved backflow prevention devices may be used. 
(6)  It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where backflow devices are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per year. In those instances where the Town deems the hazard to be great enough, he or she may require certified inspections at more frequent intervals. These shall be performed by a certified inspector and/or tester. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever said devices are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs and overhauls shall be kept and made available to the Town Manager. The attached form shall be submitted to the agency within thirty (30) days after the device has been tested and/or inspected. 
(7)  Installation of new devices. The agency will be informed of all backflow prevention devices that are installed on any premises. Upon installation, the device will be inspected and tested by a certified inspector and/or tester. The agency will be informed in writing of the results of this inspection and test. 
(Prior code 187-31) 
Sec. 3-4-33. - Existing cross-connections. 
    Within a reasonable time following the adoption of the regulation, existing cross-connections between a public water system and any secondary water system shall be eliminated or protected by means of an approved backflow preventer. 
(Prior code 187-32) 
Sec. 3-4-34. - Irrigation and fire systems. 
(a)  Irrigation systems. The following guidelines relating to backflow prevention devices for irrigation systems shall apply: 
(1)  Atmospheric vacuum breakers shall be installed after the last control valve of each sprinkler circuit and at a minimum of six (6) inches above the highest irrigation head. The atmospheric vacuum breaker shall be installed only on irrigation circuits with heads that will not return any pressure in the circuit when the circuit control valve is closed. 
(2)  Pressure vacuum breakers shall be installed at the beginning of each irrigation circuit and at a minimum of twelve (12) inches above the highest irrigation head on the circuit. Individual irrigation circuits, having quick coupling valves or other similar type heads that will permit pressure to be retained in the circuit, shall have a pressure vacuum breaker installed as a minimum requirement for each circuit. Irrigation systems using the subsurface drip method shall have a pressure vacuum breaker on each circuit. A pressure vacuum breaker may not be installed where a double check valve assembly, reduced-pressure principal backflow prevention device or air-gap separation is required. 
(3)  A double check valve assembly may be installed to serve multiple irrigation circuits in lieu of vacuum breakers on each individual irrigation circuit. 
(4)  A reduced-pressure principal backflow preventer or air-gap separation shall be required before any piping network in which fertilizers, pesticides and other chemicals or toxic contaminants are injected or siphoned into the irrigation system. A reduced-pressure principal backflow preventer may be installed to serve multiple irrigation circuits in lieu of vacuum breakers on each individual irrigation circuit. 
(b)  Fire systems. 
(1)  Water systems for fighting fire, derived from a supply that cannot be approved as safe or potable for human use shall, whenever practicable, be kept wholly separate from drinking water pipelines and equipment. In cases where the domestic water system is used for both drinking and fire-fighting purposes, approved backflow prevention devices shall be installed to protect such individual drinking water lines as are not used for fire-fighting purposes. It is hereby declared that it is the responsibility of the person causing the introduction of said unapproved or unsafe water into the pipelines to see that a procedure be developed and carried out to notify and protect users of this piping system during the emergency and that special precautions be taken to disinfect thoroughly and flush out all pipelines which may have become contaminated before they are again used to furnish drinking water. In the event that the means of protection of water consumers is by disinfection of the auxiliary fire-fighting supply, the installation and its use shall be thoroughly reliable. 
(2)  When disinfection of the auxiliary supply itself is depended upon to render the water safe, the means of applying the disinfectant under these regulations shall be automatic with operation of the pump or pumps employed with the dangerous water in question. Adequate supplies of chlorine or its compounds must be kept on hand at all times. Chlorine-dosing equipment shall be tested daily and kept in good operating condition. 
(3)  The public water supply must be protected against backflow from dual domestic fire systems. 
(Prior code 187-33)

(c)  In addition or as an alternative to such fine and/or imprisonment, the Town may seek other remedies provided in law or equity including but not limited to damages, injunction, mandamus or abatement. 
(Ord. 1999-14 §18) 
ARTICLE VIII - Flood Damage Prevention 

Sec. 3-8-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State has, in Title 29, Article 20, C.R.S., delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the Town Council does hereby adopt the floodplain management regulations set forth in this Article. 
(Ord. 2011-07 §1) 
Sec. 3-8-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the Town are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of the public. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. 2011-07 §1) 
Sec. 3-8-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this Article to promote public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to critical facilities, infrastructure and other public facilities such as water, sewer and gas mains; electric and communications stations; and streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is located in a flood hazard area. 
(Ord. 2011-07 §1) 
Sec. 3-8-4. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this Article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. 2011-07 §1)

Permits are required to ensure that proposed development projects meet the requirements of the NFIP and this Article. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and/or nonstructural additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway ( regulatory floodway ) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. The Colorado statewide standard for the designated height to be used for all newly studied reaches shall be one-half (1/2) foot (six [6] inches). Letters of Map Revision to existing floodway delineations may continue to use the floodway criteria in place at the time of the existing floodway delineation. 
    Freeboard means the vertical distance in feet above a predicted water surface elevation intended to provide a margin of safety to compensate for unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood, such as debris blockage of bridge openings and the increased runoff due to urbanization of the watershed.

    Substantial Improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before Start of Construction of the improvement. The value of the structure shall be determined by the local jurisdiction having land use authority in the area of interest. This includes structures which have incurred Substantial Damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
a.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
b.  Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure.

(10)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area. 
(Ord. 2011-07 §1) 
Sec. 3-8-17. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The Appeal Board, as established by the Community, shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this Article. 
(b)  The Appeal Board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this Article. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)  The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this Article. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the relevant factors in Section 3-8-16 above have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this Article, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this Article as stated in Section 3-8-3 of this Article. 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the Base Flood Elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a Functionally Dependent Use, provided that: 
(1)  The criteria outlined in Section 3-8-15 of this Article are met; and 
(2)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(Ord. 2011-07 §1) 
Sec. 3-8-18. - Penalties for noncompliance. 
    Violations of this Article shall be prosecuted, and penalties for conviction thereof, as set forth in Section 1-1-19 of this Code. 
(Ord. 2011-07 §1) 
Sec. 3-8-19. - General standards. 
    In all Special Flood Hazard Areas, the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

(5)  All manufactured homes shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(6)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. 
(7)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood waters. 
(8)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. 2011-07 §1) 
Sec. 3-8-20. - Specific standards. 
    In all Special Flood Hazard Areas where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in Section 3-8-7, Paragraph 3-8-15(7) or Section 3-8-24 of this Article, the following provisions are required:

New construction and Substantial Improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement) and any electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and/or other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered Colorado Professional Engineer, architect or land surveyor. Such certification shall be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. 
a.  With the exception of Critical Facilities, outlined in Section 3-8-26, new construction and Substantial Improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) and any electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and/or other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that, at one (1) foot above the base flood level, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
b.  A registered Colorado Professional Engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this Paragraph. Such certification shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator, as proposed in Section 3-8-16 of this Article. 
(3)  Enclosures. 
a.  New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
b.  Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered Colorado Professional Engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
1.  A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade.

(6)  Prior approved activities. Any activity for which a Floodplain Development Permit was issued by the Town or a CLOMR was issued by FEMA prior to November 9, 2011, may be completed according to the standards in place at the time of the permit or CLOMR issuance and will not be considered in violation of this Article if it meets such standards. 
(Ord. 2011-07 §1; Ord. 2018-13 §1) 
Sec. 3-8-21. - Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO/AH Zones). 
    Located within the Special Flood Hazard Area established in Section 3-8-7 of this Code, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  Residential construction. All new construction and Substantial Improvements of residential structures must have the lowest floor (including basement), and any electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one (1) foot above the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least three (3) feet if no depth number is specified). Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered Colorado Professional Engineer, architect or land surveyor. Such certification shall be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. With the exception of Critical Facilities outlined in Section 3-8-26, all new construction and Substantial Improvements of nonresidential structures must have the lowest floor (including the basement), and any electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one (1) foot above the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least three (3) feet if no depth number is specified), or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that the structure is watertight to at least one (1) foot above the base flood level with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. A registered Colorado Professional Engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this Section, as proposed in Section 3-8-16, are satisfied. 
Within Zones AH or AO, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes are required to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. 2011-07 §1; Ord. 2018-13 §1) 
Sec. 3-8-22. - Floodways. 
    Floodways are administrative limits and tools used to regulate existing and future floodplain development. The State has adopted Floodway standards that are more stringent than the FEMA minimum standard (see definition of floodway in Section 3-8-5 of this Article). Located within the Special Flood Hazard Area established in Section 3-8-7 of this Article are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory Floodway, unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed by a licensed Colorado Professional Engineer and in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase (requires a No-Rise Certification) in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If Paragraph (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 3-8-19 through 3-8-26 of this Article. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a CLOMR and floodway revision through FEMA. 
(Ord. 2011-07 §1) 
Sec. 3-8-23. - Alteration of watercourse. 
    For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse within a Special Flood Hazard Area, the following standards apply: 
(1)  Channelization and flow diversion projects shall appropriately consider issues of sediment transport, erosion, deposition and channel migration and properly mitigate potential problems through the project, as well as upstream and downstream of any improvement activity. A detailed analysis of sediment transport and overall channel stability should be considered, when appropriate, to assist in determining the most appropriate design. 
(2)  Channelization and flow diversion projects shall evaluate the residual 100-year floodplain. 
(3)  Any channelization or other stream alteration activity proposed by a project proponent must be evaluated for its impact on the regulatory floodplain and be in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local floodplain rules, regulations and ordinances. 
(4)  Any stream alteration activity shall be designed and sealed by a registered Colorado Professional Engineer or Certified Professional Hydrologist. 
(5)  All activities within the regulatory floodplain shall meet all applicable federal, state and Town floodplain requirements and regulations. 
(6)  Within the Regulatory Floodway, stream alteration activities shall not be constructed unless the project proponent demonstrates through a Floodway analysis and report, sealed by a registered Colorado Professional Engineer, that there is not more than a zero-hundredths-foot rise in the proposed conditions compared to existing conditions Floodway resulting from the project, otherwise known as a No-Rise Certification, unless the community first applies for a CLOMR and Floodway revision in accordance with Section 3-8-22 above. 
(7)  Maintenance shall be required for any altered or relocated portions of watercourses so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished. 
(Ord. 2011-07 §1) 
Sec. 3-8-24. - Properties removed from floodplain by fill. 
    A Floodplain Development Permit shall not be issued for the construction of a new structure or addition to an existing structure on a property removed from the floodplain by the issuance of a FEMA Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F), with a lowest floor elevation placed below the base flood elevation with one (1) foot of freeboard that existed prior to the placement of fill. 
(Ord. 2011-07 §1) 
Sec. 3-8-25. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision or other development proposal is in a flood-prone area, the proposal shall minimize flood damage. 
(b)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet Floodplain Development Permit requirements of Section 3-8-8, Section 3-8-16 and the provisions of Sections 3-8-19 through 3-8-26 of this Article. 
(c)  Base Flood Elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Section 3-8-7 or Section 3-8-15 of this Article. 
(d)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(e)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. 2011-07 §1) 
Sec. 3-8-26. - Standards for critical facilities. 
    A Critical Facility is a structure or related infrastructure, but not the land on which it is situated, as specified in Rule 6 of the Rules and Regulations for Regulatory Floodplains in Colorado, that, if flooded, may result in significant hazards to public health and safety or interrupt essential services and operations for the community at any time before, during and after a flood. 
(1)  Classification of Critical Facilities. 
It is the responsibility of the Town Council to identify and confirm that specific structures in its community meet the criteria set forth below: 
Critical Facilities are classified under the following categories: (a) Essential Services; (b) Hazardous Materials; (c) At-risk Populations; and (d) Vital to Restoring Normal Services. 
a.  Essential services facilities include public safety, emergency response, emergency medical, designated emergency shelters, communications, public utility plant facilities and transportation lifelines. These facilities consist of: 
1.  Public safety (police stations, fire and rescue stations, emergency vehicle and equipment storage and emergency operation centers); 
2.  Emergency medical (hospitals, ambulance service centers, urgent care centers having emergency treatment functions and non-ambulatory surgical structures, but excluding clinics, doctors offices and non-urgent care medical structures that do not provide these functions); 
3.  Designated emergency shelters; 
4.  Communications (main hubs for telephone, broadcasting equipment for cable systems, satellite dish systems, cellular systems, television, radio and other emergency warning systems, but excluding towers, poles, lines, cables and conduits); 
5.  Public utility plant facilities for generation and distribution (hubs, treatment plants, substations and pumping stations for water, power and gas, but not including towers, poles, power lines, buried pipelines, transmission lines, distribution lines and service lines); and 
6.  Air Transportation lifelines (airports [municipal and larger]), helicopter pads and structures serving emergency functions, and associated infrastructure (aviation control towers, air traffic control centers and emergency equipment aircraft hangars). 
Specific exemptions to this category include wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), nonpotable water treatment and distribution systems and hydroelectric power generating plants and related appurtenances. 
Public utility plant facilities may be exempted if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Town Council that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same utility or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract) and connected, the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with the provisions of this Article, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant systems will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the Town Council on an as-needed basis upon request. 
b.  Hazardous materials facilities include facilities that produce or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials. These facilities may include: 
1.  Chemical and pharmaceutical plants (chemical plant, pharmaceutical manufacturing); 
2.  Laboratories containing highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials; 
3.  Refineries; 
4.  Hazardous waste storage and disposal sites; and 
5.  Aboveground gasoline or propane storage or sales centers. 
Facilities shall be determined to be Critical Facilities if they produce or store materials in excess of threshold limits. If the owner of a facility is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to keep a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) on file for any chemicals stored or used in the work place, and the chemicals are stored in quantities equal to or greater than the Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ) for that chemical, then that facility shall be considered to be a critical facility. The TPQ for these chemicals is: either five hundred (500) pounds or the TPQ listed (whichever is lower) for the three hundred fifty-six (356) chemicals listed under 40 C.F.R. § 302 (2010), also known as Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS); or ten thousand (10,000) pounds for any other chemical. This threshold is consistent with the requirements for reportable chemicals established by the Colorado Department of Health and Environment. OSHA requirements for MSDS can be found in 29 C.F.R. § 1910 (2010). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation "Designation, Reportable Quantities, and Notification," 40 C.F.R. § 302 (2010) and OSHA regulation "Occupational Safety and Health Standards," 29 C.F.R. § 1910 (2010) are incorporated herein by reference and include the regulations in existence at the time of the promulgation of this Article, but exclude later amendments to or editions of the regulations. 
Specific exemptions to this category include: 
1.  Finished consumer products within retail centers and households containing hazardous materials intended for household use, and agricultural products intended for agricultural use. 
2.  Buildings and other structures containing hazardous materials for which it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local authority having jurisdiction by hazard assessment and certification by a qualified professional (as determined by the local jurisdiction having land use authority) that a release of the subject hazardous material does not pose a major threat to the public. 
3.  Pharmaceutical sales, use, storage and distribution centers that do not manufacture pharmaceutical products. 
These exemptions shall not apply to buildings or other structures that also function as Critical Facilities under another category outlined in this Article. 
c.  At-risk population facilities include medical care, congregate care and schools. These facilities consist of: 
1.  Elder care ( nursing homes); 
2.  Congregate care serving twelve (12) or more individuals (day care and assisted living); and 
3.  Public and private schools (pre-schools, K-12 schools), before-school and after-school care serving twelve [12] or more children); 
d.  Facilities vital to restoring normal services, including government operations. These facilities consist of: 
1.  Essential government operations (public records, courts, jails, building permitting and inspection services, community administration and management, maintenance and equipment centers); and

CHAPTER 4 - Community Development 
CHAPTER 4 
Community Development 
ARTICLE I - General Provisions 
Division 1 - General 

Sec. 4-1-1. - Authority. 
    This Chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority granted to the Town as a Home Rule municipality under Article XX of the Constitution of the State of Colorado, the Town Charter, Article 23, Chapter 31, C.R.S., Section 29-20-101 et seq., CRS and Section 24-65-101 et seq., CRS, to the extent that such state statutes are not inconsistent with this Code, and is hereby declared to be in accordance with all provisions of these statutes, for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, convenience, order, prosperity and welfare of the present and future inhabitants of the Town. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-1-2. - Purpose. 
    This Chapter is enacted to preserve and promote the public health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the Town and of the public generally and to encourage and facilitate the orderly growth and expansion of the Town. This Chapter combines the provisions more commonly found in separate zoning and subdivision ordinances into a single land development code that will cover all phases of development. The intent of the unified approach is to: 
(1)  Address the way land development now occurs, that is, in a manner which combines traditional distinctions between zoning and subdivision and which typically contains a variety of residential and nonresidential uses in a single development. 
(2)  Provide for a more efficient regulatory control system by including the review processes for all types and stages of development. This results in an integrated set of regulations and standards that participants in the development process need to become familiar with. 
(3)  Avoid the overlapping, conflicting or inconsistent ordinance provisions that frequently occur as a result of numerous individual ordinances. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-1-3. - Jurisdiction. 
(a)  This Chapter shall apply to all properties within the legal boundaries of the Town. 
(b)  With respect to major arterial and collector roadways, this Chapter is applicable within a three-mile radius of the corporate limits of the Town except roadways located in another municipality. 
(c)  A copy of a map showing the boundaries of the Town's boundary shall be available to the public in the Community Development Department. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-1-4. - Compliance with Comprehensive Plan. 
(a)  All site development shall be consistent with the Town's Comprehensive Plan and other applicable Town Master Plans. 
(b)  No application for site development shall be approved if not in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan or other Town Plans, and such failure shall be a reasonable ground for denial of the application. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-1-5. - Application of regulations. 
    Except as hereinafter otherwise provided: 
(1)  Building use. No building or structure shall be used or erected, and no existing building or structure shall be moved, altered, added to or enlarged, nor shall any land, building or premises be used, designated or intended to be used for any purpose or in any manner other than the residential, public, business, commercial and industrial uses hereinafter listed as being permitted in the district in which such building, land or premises is located. 
(2)  Site use. No building or structure shall be erected, nor shall any existing building or structure be altered, enlarged or rebuilt, nor shall any open space surrounding any building be encroached upon or reduced in any manner, except in conformity with the yard, building site area and building location and height regulations hereinafter designated for the district in which such building or open space is located. 
(3)  Single site application. No yard frontage or other open space provided about any building for the purpose of complying with provisions of this Chapter shall be considered as providing parking, yard or other open space for any other building, and no yard or other open space on one (1) lot shall be considered as providing a yard, parking or open space for a building on any other lot. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-1-6. - Review fees. 
    Reasonable fees sufficient to cover the costs of administration, inspection, publication of notice and similar matters may be charged to applicants for zoning permits, conditional use permits, subdivision plat approval, zoning amendments, variances, site plans, and other administrative relief. The amount of the fees charged as shown in Appendix A. 
(1)  Procedure for payment. At the time the application for land use approval is first submitted to the Town, and prior to any review, the applicant shall pay to the Town the fee necessary to cover the administrative and review costs for each project requiring review. The Community Development Director may, in his or her sole discretion, waive all or any portion of such fee. The applicant must establish an initial deposit in the account in an amount to be fixed by the Community Development Department, and prior to further processing of the application by the Town. The applicant shall regularly maintain a minimum amount (established by the Community Development Department) in the account and replenish the account as it is drawn upon. Review will be terminated until the account is brought current. 
(2)  Return of funds. Within thirty (30) days after final development approval or within thirty (30) days after the applicant has given written notice that it will not proceed with the development, the Town will determine the balance owing to the applicant (that amount deposited over the costs incurred) and return that amount to the applicant's last known address. 
(3)  Lien on property. If the Town incurs costs beyond the amount deposited with the Town and the applicant does not pay those costs within thirty (30) days after written notice from the Town, the Town shall be entitled to a lien for those costs on the land being developed, which lien may be perfected and foreclosed or collected in the same manner as provided in Section 31-20-105 or 38-22-101 et seq., C.R.S. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-1-7. - Basic use, location and bulk. 
(a)  The permitted uses, basic location and bulk regulations for the various zoning districts are hereby adopted and declared to be parts of this Chapter, and may be amended in the same manner as any other part of this Chapter.

(1)  All regulations set forth or referred to in the regulations for the district in which such buildings and other structures are located; and 
(2)  Any other applicable regulations of this Chapter. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-1-8. - Waivers and amendments. 
(a)  The Town Council may authorize waivers from the provisions of this Chapter for government and quasi-governmental entities, including the Town. Such waivers may be granted if it is deemed by the Town Council to be in the public interest and does not impair the intent and purposes of this Chapter. The conditions of any waiver authorized shall be stated in writing by the Town Council with the justifications set forth. 
(b)  The Town Council, upon its own motion and following the recommendation of the Planning Commission, may consider revisions or amendments to this Chapter after giving public notice of any proposed revision or amendment and after holding a public hearing concerning the proposal. Public hearings before the Planning Commission and Town Council shall be noticed as set forth in Section 4-7-3 of this Chapter. The Council shall adopt any revisions or amendments by ordinance. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-1-9. - Vested property rights. 
(a)  For all site developments, the final approval step, irrespective of its title, which occurs prior to building permit shall be considered the "site specific development plan" for purposes of Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S. 
(b)  In the event an applicant for site development approval wishes said approval to have the effect of creating vested property rights pursuant to Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S., the applicant must so request, in writing, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date said approval is to be considered. Failure to so request renders the approval not a "site specific development plan," and no vested rights shall be deemed to have been created thereby. 
(c)  In the event amendments to a site specific development are proposed and approved, the effective date of such amendments, for purposes of duration of a vested property right, shall be the date of the approval of the original site specific development plan, unless the Town Council specifically finds to the contrary and incorporates such finding in its approval of the amendment. 
(d)  The Town Council may revoke a vested property right for failure to abide by the terms and conditions of such vested property right. Prior to taking action to revoke a vested property right, the Town Council shall provide a hearing to the affected landowner and shall provide at least fourteen (14) days' prior written notice mailed to the property address of record in the County Assessor's office as well as provide notice in the same manner as the posting or publishing of ordinances and resolutions. 
(e)  Nothing in this Section is intended to create any vested property right, but only to implement the provisions of Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S. In the event of the repeal of said Article, or a judicial determination that said Article is invalid or unconstitutional, this Section shall be deemed to be repealed, and the provisions hereof no longer effective. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-1-10. - Severability. 
    It is hereby declared to be the expressed intent that the provisions of this Chapter shall be severable. If any provision of this Chapter is declared to be invalid by a decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, it is hereby declared to be the intent that: 
(1)  The effect of such decision shall be limited to the clause, sentence, paragraph or part of this Chapter that is expressly stated in the decision to be invalid; and 
(2)  Such decision shall not affect, impair or nullify this Chapter as a whole or any other part thereof, and the rest of this Chapter shall continue in full force and effect. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-1-11. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of the provisions of this Chapter, the following regulations shall govern: 
(1)  Provisions are minimum requirements. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be regarded as the minimum requirements for the protection of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, prosperity and welfare of the residents of the Town. These regulations shall be liberally construed to further their underlying purposes. 
(2)  Application of overlapping regulations. Whenever both a provision of this Chapter, and any other provisions of this Chapter or any provision in any law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, contain any restrictions covering any of the same subject matter, whichever regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements shall govern. 
(3)  Existing permits and private agreements. This Chapter shall not abrogate or annul: 
a.  Any permits issued before the effective date of the ordinance codified herein; 
b.  Any easement; or

Any project that is inactive for six (6) months or more must be resubmitted with new submittal information and fees. Failure to meet this six-month time line will result in applications becoming permanently inactive and the applicants forfeiting their fees. 
(b)  Approval by the Town Council or Planning Commission of any site plan or conditional use shall remain in effect for a period of six (6) months. Any approval of an application for which a grading permit or building permit has not been applied for or for which the conditional use has not commenced within six (6) months after approval of the site plan or conditional use application shall be null and void. An extension of time of up to ninety (90) days may be granted by the Community Development Director for good cause. The decision of the Community Development Director is final. If denied, the applicant may resubmit a new application and fees for the same project. 
(c)  Upon denial of any site development substantially the same application, as determined by the Community Development Director, may not be resubmitted for a period of six (6) months commencing from the date of denial. The determination of the Community Development Director shall be final. 
(d)  Responsibility for complete and proper application submittal shall be that of the applicant. Failure to do so will result in a delay or denial of the application. Furthermore, if any documentation presented to the Community Development Department is found to be fraudulent, the application will be denied or approval revoked.

(a)  All site development in the Eagle's Nest Development, as annexed to the Town and described in the Table of Zoning Map Amendments at Section 7 of Ordinance 1994-31, shall be reviewed pursuant to the requirements of this Chapter; provided, however, that individual phases of said development, designated as such on the Eagle's Nest Master Plan, a part of the Town's Comprehensive Plan, are permitted to be reviewed on a phased basis through the preliminary plan stage, and as phases, are not required to be reviewed at the final plan stage. Instead, subsequent to preliminary plan approval of a phase of the Eagle's Nest Development, individual, smaller portions of each phase, to be designated as "filings," may be reviewed at the final plat stage only. 
(b)  The Design Guidelines for the Eagle's Nest Development (a copy of which is on file with the Community Development Department) shall be relied upon by the Department, the Commission and the Town Council in reviewing the Eagle's Nest Development, except in regard to building height. Building height shall be calculated using the building height definition in Section 4-2-1. Failure to comply with the Design Guidelines shall be an independent ground for denial of any such application, or for revocation of an approval once granted.

Applicants seeking site development approval should refer to the chart to determine which one (1) or more "APPROVALS REQUESTED" under the left-hand column of the chart applies to the proposed site development. The required stages of review for such approval are shown on the lines to the right. Submission requirements and the specific review process for each stage are set out in detail in the balance of this Chapter under the appropriate headings.

The Town Council's decision, at any stage in the review process, shall be final. If, in the opinion of the Community Development Department, a submittal at any stage of review is incomplete, the matter shall be removed from the agenda and not further processed until deemed complete. 
(c)  The Community Development Department, Planning Commission or Town Council may require, prior to or as a part of any preliminary or final site development review, that the applicant permit a site visit. In the event a site visit is required, the applicant shall provide access to the property sufficient to accommodate the needs of the site visit and shall, upon request by the Community Development Department, stake, flag or otherwise identify on or above the ground those features of the property or the proposed development (for example, wetland boundaries, proposed building envelopes and heights, road alignments) requested. 
(d)  The Community Development Department, Public Works Department, Planning Commission or Town Council may require, at any stage of review of any site development, submission of any plan, study, survey or other information, in addition to that specified in this Chapter, and at the applicant's expense, as such body may determine necessary to enable it to review and act upon the application. 
(e)  An applicant may request and Community Development Department may schedule at staff's discretion a work session with the Planning Commission and Town Council prior to submitting for a preliminary plan application. The intent of the work session is to advise the applicant of issues related to the specific Code requirements and Comprehensive Plan conformance.

c.  The seasonal fluctuation of the appropriative right sought to be dedicated as well as its historic patterns of use. (Note: Specifically, historic consumptive use will be the most important parameter evaluated.) 
d.  The status of the appropriative right, as determined by the State Water Engineer, the Water Court for Division Five or other state official or agency under the Water Rights Determination and Administrative Act of 1969. 
e.  The quantity of flow in terms of cubic feet per second or other standard of measurement.

Sec. 4-4-13. - Riverfront Zone District. 
(a)  Statement of concept of riverfront zoning. 
(1)  The Blue River is the center and principal attraction of the Town. The Riverfront Zone District is intended to promote the Blue River as the central image of the Town. All site development proposals shall use and promote the intrinsic characteristics of the river and the riverfront property. High density residential development that may be mixed with appropriate commercial uses is desired in the Riverfront Zone District. The Riverfront District should be attractive to residents and visitors. 
(2)  Each site development should be attractive from both the river and the Town Right-of-Way. The Town encourages pedestrian friendly settings in the Riverfront Zone District. Access should be obvious to a pedestrian from either the street or the river. Both new residential and business uses should provide outdoor open space on the riverside. Site design and landscape should be attractively and carefully planned. 
(3)  The intent of the Riverfront District is to provide a transition from the commercial areas to the south and the residential areas to the north. The Riverfront Zone District is envisioned as a high density residential area with distinct character and a strong relationship to the Blue River. Development on either side of the river shall provide a pedestrian pathway paralleling the Blue River and connecting with adjacent pedestrian paths. 
(4)  The Town encourages high quality development in the Riverfront Zone District that provides a variety of architectural elements that avoid featureless design and uninterrupted repetition of building materials. Building massing, form, length and proportions shall be designed to provide variety of visual interest while maintaining a human scale that is appropriate. 
(5)  The provisions of this Section only apply to new development or major redevelopment of property within the Riverfront Zone District. Existing and non-conforming uses may continue as long as they remain otherwise lawful. 
(a)  Permitted uses: consult the use schedule at Section 4-4-17. 
(b)  Lot frontage, minimum: one hundred (100) feet. 
(c)  Lot coverage, maximum sixty percent (60%) of total lot area. 
(d)  Front setback, for fifty percent (50%) of the lot frontage, a zero (0) setback is permitted, for the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the lot frontage, a minimum five (5) foot setback is required. 
(e)  Side setback, at least five (5) feet from all property lines not abutting the river or street. 
(f)  River setback, twenty-five (25) feet measured from the upper bank of the Blue River. 
(g)  The maximum building height shall be as stated and described in the Design District Standards and Guidelines. 
(h)  Access pathway. There must be a convenient and safe pedestrian path, finished with a surface suitable for walking, at least six (6) feet in width from the side of the site development facing away from the river, through or around buildings, to the riverfront pathway 
(i)  Dwelling Unit Density. The maximum number of residential dwelling units permitted per acre of land is twenty-five (25). 
(j)  Path connections. All site development adjacent to the Blue River shall provide a twenty-five-foot pedestrian path easement within the minimum setback, from the top of the bank of the Blue River. The developer shall construct the pedestrian path according to the Town Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan and in conformance with Section 4-5-16. All site development shall also provide a continuous six (6) foot concrete sidewalk the length of the property within the Highway 9 right-of-way. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2; Ord. 2008-10 §1; Ord. 2008-11 §3; Ord. 2015-06, §1 ) 
Sec. 4-4-14. - Planned Unit Development. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of Planned Unit Development in the Town is to encourage flexibility, creativity and innovative approaches in the development of land, to promote its appropriate and intrinsic uses, to enhance the design, character and quality of new development, to maximize the efficient use of land, to facilitate the harmonious growth of the Town, to preserve the natural and scenic features of open and wooded areas and to understand and respect the physiographic limitations of the environment. The permitted uses may include any use permitted in any zone district. However, the uses allowed shall be determined upon submission and approval of the formal application. 
(b)  General requirements: 
    Description of the PUD process: 
(1)  Preapplication conference, Subsection (e) below, is the first step in the PUD process. The preapplication conference is intended to provide the applicant with a means of understanding regulations, policies and procedures prior to making a formal submission. 
(2)  Preliminary Plan and Final PUD. The two (2) steps required to obtain approval of a PUD are: (1) Preliminary Plan - a review at a preliminary level includes proposed land uses, location of density, location of geologic hazards, identification of environmentally sensitive areas, location of wildlife habitat areas, location of parks, open space, sources of required services, vehicular and pedestrian circulation, detail review of development of guidelines, and conformance with the Town Comprehensive Plan and other approved master plans; and (2) Final PUD - a review of all Final plans and guide. Each step is an individual review process and may not be combined at any step. 
(3)  Each step is a distinct process. Preliminary Plan and Final PUD processes involve the submittal of an application, an application fee, required plans and reports, referrals of the proposal to other agencies and public hearings/meetings. At each step of the process, the level of design and engineering increases in order to relieve the applicant from major and potentially unnecessary expenses in situations that may require a redesign and therefore, a revision of expensive engineering or planning reports. Approval of the Preliminary Plan does not ensure approval of the Final PUD. 
(4)  Alterations of approved development plan. The PUD Plan and PUD development guide, as approved by the Town Council, shall be binding and shall not be altered during the construction of the Planned Unit Development, except as hereinafter set forth. 
a.  Minor amendment. Minor alterations in locations, siting, alignments, bulk of structures, placement or types of plant material, changes in grades, heights or character of structures or other similar alterations must be reviewed by the Community Development Department, in accordance with Section 4-1-22 if required by circumstances not foreseen at the time the Final development plan was approved. 
b.  Major amendment. All other alterations in use, intent, rearrangement of lots, realignment of major circulation patterns, density levels, provisions governing common or open spaces or the ratio thereof, or any other alterations that substantially change the Planned Unit Development must be reviewed as a major amendment. Major amendments shall follow the review process in Section 4-1-22 for major PUD amendments, requiring a Preapplication and Final review. The same type and quality of data shall be required as for the original and final approval and passage. 
(5)  Applicant's responsibility. The applicant or representative is responsible for understanding the requirements and procedures contained in this Article, the Town Comprehensive Plan and all other applicable Town plans and ordinances, and is responsible for attending all Planning Commission and Town Council hearings/meetings at which the request is considered. Failure to attend the hearings/meetings may result in the request being denied or tabled and a new hearing/meeting date scheduled. The applicant is responsible for submitting the information requested by staff for the review of the proposal. 
(6)  Additional reviews fees. The applicant shall be responsible for payment of reasonable review fees as established under Appendix A of this Code. 
(7)  Withdrawal of application. The applicant may withdraw an application at any phase of the process upon submittal of a written request to the Community Development Department. 
(8)  Inactive files. Any application for a PUD that becomes inactive, whereby the applicant is required to submit additional information or request a hearing date and has failed to do so, for a period of more than six (6) months, shall become void, and the resubmittal of a new application and fees shall be required to pursue the PUD request. The Community Development Director may grant no more than two (2) extensions of time, of no more than three (3) months each, upon a written request by the applicant. After five (5) months, the staff planner shall notify the applicant in writing that the application will become void within thirty (30) days. After thirty (30) days, provided the applicant has not submitted the required additional information or requested a hearing date, the staff planner shall notify the applicant in writing that the application is void. This provision shall apply to all applications on file with the Town upon the effective date of adoption and any application thereafter. 
(c)  Density and yard requirements. 
(1)  Density. For proposals which will not rely upon existing zoned density, if any, density will be determined upon submission and approval of the Final PUD plan and guide. The applicant shall be responsible for justifying the proposed density level in terms of land planning and physiographic data. The Town shall use the underlying zoning as a guide to suggest such densities. 
(2)  Yard requirements. Yard requirements will be determined upon submission and approval of the Final PUD plan and guide. The applicant shall be responsible for justifying the proposed yard requirements in terms of land planning and fire safety. 
(3)  Height requirements. The maximum height of structures must be approved by the Town Council upon review of each Planned Unit Development in relation to the following factors: 
a.  Geographical position. 
b.  The probable effect on surrounding slopes and hills. 
c.  Adverse visual effects upon adjoining property owners, other areas of a Planned Unit Development, public lands or public rights-of-way. 
d.  Potential problems for adjacent sites caused by shade, shadows, loss of air circulation or loss of view. 
e.  Surrounding traffic conditions and lines of sight. 
f.  Uses within each building. 
(d)  PUD Plan and Guide. 
(1)  All Planned Unit Developments shall submit a development guide which establishes the standards, variations and requirements for the development which may be divergent from the standards of this Chapter. Those conditions established by the development guide and approved by the Town Council shall be recorded and utilized for development and review of the project. 
(2)  In connection with any approval or conditional approval of a Planned Unit Development or amendment thereto, without the necessity of an application to the Board of Adjustment under Article I, Division 4 of this Chapter, the Town may permit variances to height, setback, yard and other requirements (but not in excess of the number or kind of variance which would otherwise be permitted by the Board of Adjustment), to be approved as part of any approved Planned Unit Development, or amendment thereto. An approved PUD may vary or waive any requirement of this Chapter, only to the extent such varied or waived condition is recognized in the approved PUD Plan and/or PUD Guide. 
(3)  In the event the property is not already zoned PUD, an ordinance shall accompany the Final PUD application. Approval of the Final PUD application shall include first and second reading approval of the ordinance. Upon approval of the PUD, the PUD Plan and Guide shall be filed with the Town Clerk as a matter of public record, a copy of the PUD Plan and Guide shall also be recorded at the Clerk and Recorder Office, and the Zoning District Map shall be amended to show the property as zoned "PUD." The applicant shall provide a reproducible Mylar of all PUD plans at a scale acceptable to the Town, submitted as part of the Final development plan, and shall make such submission within thirty (30) days following final approval. The Official Zoning District Map shall, upon such filing, be deemed to include the new Planned Unit Development District designation and the map upgraded accordingly. 
(e)  Preapplication conference. 
(1)  Intent. This stage of review is designed to provide the applicant with a means of understanding regulations, policies and procedures prior to any formal submission and to learn whom to contact and work with in the process. The Community Development Department will arrange for any joint meetings with other offices/departments, when appropriate, so that discussion of a proposal can occur at one (1) time with the applicant rather than having meetings occur at separate times with each person or department involved. 
(2)  Procedure. 
a.  The applicant should make an appointment with the Community Development Department. The Community Development Department should be provided with some information to determine whether or not other departments need to be involved in the initial discussion. 
b.  The Community Development Department would then arrange for an informal meeting, so that the applicant can discuss the proposal. 
c.  The informal meeting would be held with the applicant providing a brief presentation of the proposal to those present. The goal is then to have a constructive dialogue occur and for the applicant to receive some guidance with respect to a formal application to the Town at a later time. 
d.  Should the applicant decide to proceed further, formal submission of a complete application, based upon the recommendation of the Community Development Department, Town regulations and the applicant's desires, should then occur. 
(f)  PUD Preliminary Plan. 
(1)  Intent. 
a.  The intent of the PUD Preliminary Plan is to examine the feasibility of a project, including review of the proposed design, proposed land uses, location of density, location of geologic hazards, identification of environmentally sensitive areas, wetlands and wildlife habitat areas and conformance with the Town Comprehensive Plan, other applicable master plans, zoning requirements and requirements of this Article. The Preliminary Plan shall include a Preliminary PUD Plan and Guide.

The applicant shall distribute any revised plans, as required by staff. 
d.  All Preliminary Plan applications may be submitted to Town departments and other review agencies for review and comment if, in the opinion of the Community Development Department, the agency may be affected by the application or if comments by the agency will ensure a thorough analysis of the application. A list of review agencies is maintained and available at the Community Development Department. 
e.  Referral agencies shall comment in writing within twenty-five (25) days of receiving a complete submittal. The Community Development Department shall forward referral comments to the applicant in a timely manner.

Sec. 4-4-18. - Uses not mentioned. 
    No building permit shall be issued for a use not specifically mentioned or described by category in this Chapter. In case of doubt or dispute, and before a building permit is issued, the Community Development director shall determine the use group in which the use shall be classified. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-4-19. - Conditional use process and requirements. 
(a)  Permit required. A conditional use permit shall be required prior to the issuance of a building permit or business license associated with, or the commencement of, any use identified in this Chapter as a conditional use in the relevant zone district. No conditional use shall be considered a use by right. Any use built and actually in existence on the original effective date of this Chapter as a use by right which is rendered a conditional use in the zone district where it is located by the terms of this Chapter, as amended, shall be considered a use by right and not a conforming use. 
(b)  Procedure. 
(1)  An application with the required materials shall be filed with the Community Development Department. Only complete submittals will be accepted. Projects will not be scheduled until deemed complete by the Community Development Department. 
(2)  The application shall be reviewed in accordance with the procedure established in Section 4-1-22 and the criteria established in this Section. 
(3)  A conditional use permit is valid so long as the conditions of approval are maintained by the applicant. If an approved conditional use ceases operation for any reason for a period of one (1) year or more, the conditional use permit shall be deemed expired. 
(4)  If the conditions of a conditional use permit become the responsibility of a person or entity other than the applicant, the Community Development Department shall be notified in writing, identifying the new person or entity responsible for maintaining the conditions of the permit. Until such notice is received, the applicant shall remain responsible for maintaining those conditions. The notice shall be attached to the permit on file with the Community Development Department. 
(5)  Failure to maintain Town Council-imposed conditions shall constitute a violation of this Section, which violations may be prosecuted by a summons and complaint in the Municipal Court. Notwithstanding Section 1-1-19 of this Code, the Municipal Judge shall impose a fine of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) upon conviction of a first offense of violations of this Section, and a fine of not less than one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) for the second and all subsequent violations, but may not impose any jail sentence. Subsequent to a second conviction for violation and upon the discovery of a third or subsequent violation, the Community Development Director may schedule a public hearing at which the Town Council will consider revocation of the permit. Public notice of the hearing shall be given pursuant to Article VII of this Chapter. 
(c)  Submission requirements. The applicant for a conditional use permit shall submit to the Community Development Department any or all of the following materials, which are, in the opinion of the Community Development Director, relevant to the particular permit being requested. Only complete submittals will be accepted: 
(1)  A complete conditional use permit application and the required fee. 
(2)  A legal description of the property involved. 
(3)  A site plan showing proposed uses and structures on the property meeting all standards and requirements of Article VI . 
(4)  Scaled elevations and/or perspective drawings of any proposed structures. 
(5)  A proposed development schedule indicating: 
a.  Date of the beginning of the use and/or construction. 
b.  Phases in which the project may be developed and the anticipated rate of development. 
c.  Date of completion of the project. 
(6)  Any agreements, provisions or covenants to be recorded. 
(7)  Restoration or reclamation plans shall be required for all conditional uses requiring extensive grading and for extractive uses. 
(8)  A statement regarding any provisions for proper ongoing maintenance of the use and site. 
(9)  All proposed land use and floor space activity indicating this use type and areas clearly labeled on floor plans. 
(10)  Any additional materials which, in the opinion of the Community Development Department, are necessary to adequately review the application. 
(d)  Criteria for review and decision. The Town shall consider the following criteria when evaluating an application for conditional use permit: 
(1)  Whether the proposed use or development otherwise complies with all requirements imposed by this Chapter. 
(2)  Whether the proposed use or development is in conformance with the Town's Comprehensive Plan. 
(3)  Whether the proposed use or development is compatible with adjacent uses. Such compatibility may be expressed in appearance, architectural scale and features, site design, and the control of any adverse impacts, including noise, dust, odor, lighting, traffic, safety and impact on property values of the surrounding area. 
(4)  Suitability of location for the use or development. 
(5)  History of compliance by the applicant with the requirements of this Code and prior conditions, if any, regarding the subject property. 
(6)  Ability of the applicant or any successor-in-interest to continuously meet the conditions of the proposed permit. 
(7)  Other factors relevant to the specific application. 
(e)  Amendments. No approved conditional use or development may be modified, structurally enlarged or expanded in ground area, unless such modification, enlargement or expansion receives the prior approval of the Town, which shall be obtained by repetition of the procedures provided by this Section. 
(f)  For all uses in districts in which a conditional use is permitted pursuant to this Code, approval of a conditional use may be limited to a period of time not less than one (1) year, subject to later review and continued conditional use approval as set forth in this Section. 
(g)  If an owner of property which is subject to conditional use approval that is limited to a term of years as permitted by Subsection (f) above intends to continue the conditional use, the owner shall, prior to the expiration of the limited term of conditional use approval, submit to the Community Development Department a letter of intent to continue the approved conditional use. The owner's submission of a letter of intent to continue the conditional use shall postpone the expiration of the term of the conditional use approval until such time as the Town either approves or denies the continuation of the conditional use. Failure of the owner of property to submit a letter of intent to continue the approved conditional use shall not preclude the Town from independently initiating a review pursuant to this Section for continuation of the approved conditional use. 
(h)  Within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the owner's letter of intent, the Community Development Department shall determine whether the property owner has fully complied with and is presently in compliance with all conditions of use approval. If the Community Development Department believes that the property owner has fully complied with the conditions of use approval and is, at that time, in full compliance with the conditions of use approval, the Community Development Department may renew the conditional use approval for a period of not less than one (1) year or equal to the period of time previously granted for the conditional use. The Community Development Department shall mail to the owner at the owner's last known address notice of the renewal of such conditional use. 
(i)  If the Community Development Department believes that the owner of the property failed to comply with the conditions of use approval, is not at the present time in compliance with the conditions or denies the renewal, the Community Development Department shall set a public hearing at which the Town Council will consider the renewal or the expiration of the term of the conditional use. Public notice shall be given of such hearing according to Article VII of this Chapter. 
(j)  The Town Council may either renew the conditional use approval for a period not less than one (1) year, find that the owner has failed to substantially comply with the conditions of use approval and that the term of the conditional use has expired, choose not to renew the conditional use for other reasons or renew the conditional use approval subject to a modification of existing conditions or the addition of new conditions. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
(k)  Additional requirements for water pipelines: In addition to the foregoing, an application for a conditional use permit to construct and operate a water pipeline, as defined at Section 4-2-1 of this Chapter, shall include the submission requirements listed at Sections 4-12-35, 4-12-36 and 4-12-37 of this Code, and shall be subject to the approval criteria listed at Sections 4-12-51, 4-12-52 and 4-12-53 of this Code. Water pipelines falling within the scope of Section 4-12-24(2) of this Code are exempt from this Subsection. The application fee shall be as established in Appendix A for "Matters of State Interest" under Section 4-12-33 of this Code. In the event the applicant for a conditional use permit for a water pipeline is also applying for a permit for the same project to conduct an activity of state interest pursuant to Article XII of this Chapter, the two (2) applications may be combined and heard at the same public hearing; and submission requirements, where identical, may be combined. The Town Council may, in its sole discretion, waive any part but not all of the submission requirements in the manner permitted by Section 4-12-38 of this Code. 
(Ord. 2005-9 §3; Ord. 2008-5 §1)

(10)  The owner of the residence must establish and maintain continuous residency in either the primary residence or the single apartment. Continuous residency shall mean that the owner resides in the unit as his or her primary residence, as documented by driver's license and registration, voter registration, utility payments and other relevant indicators. 
(11)  Lease term. Any lease of the single apartment shall be for a minimum term of six (6) months. If the owner of the single family dwelling unit resides in the single apartment, any lease of the single family dwelling unit, or portions thereof, shall be for a minimum term of six (6) months.

(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-4-23. - Adult-oriented businesses. 
(a)  Legislative intent. It is the intent and purpose of this Article to regulate the time, place and manner in which adult entertainment is presented in adult-oriented businesses, to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the Town, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of adult businesses within the Town. It is not the purpose of this Article to prohibit adult entertainment or to curtail constitutionally protected freedom of expression. 
(b)  Findings of fact. The Town Council finds: 
(1)  Regulation of adult businesses furthers substantial governmental interests and is necessary because in the absence of such regulation, significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred. This history of criminal activity has included prostitution, narcotics and liquor law violations, violent crimes against persons and property crimes. 
(2)  Adult businesses are frequently used for unlawful and unhealthful sexual activities, including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature. 
(3)  The concern over sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS, is a legitimate health concern of the Town which demands reasonable regulation of adult businesses in order to protect the health and well-being of the citizens. 
(4)  Adult businesses have a deleterious effect on both neighboring businesses and surrounding residential areas causing an increase in crime and a decrease in property values. 
(5)  It is recognized that adult businesses have serious objectionable characteristics, particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other, thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area. 
(6)  The Town Council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; deter the spread of urban blight and protect the citizens from increased crime. 
(7)  It is necessary to have a manager on the premises of adult businesses at all times as such establishments are offering adult entertainment so that there will be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the establishment, including the actions of patrons, entertainers and other employees. 
(8)  The license fees required hereinafter are necessary as nominal fees designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the Town in regulating adult businesses. 
(9)  Restricted hours of operation will further prevent the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses. 
(10)  Locational criteria alone do not adequately protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens and thus certain requirements with respect to the licensing and operation of adult businesses are in the public interest.

(Ord. 2009-18 §5) 
Sec. 4-5-2. - Reserved. 
Sec. 4-5-3. - Suitability of land for subdivision. 
(a)  No preliminary plat, final plat, minor subdivision plat or condominium plat shall be recommended for approval by the Planning Commission or approved by the Town Council unless it conforms to the provisions of this Article. 
(b)  No land shall be subdivided which is determined by the Town to be unsuitable for subdivision by reason of flooding, bad drainage, rock or soil creep, mudflow, rockslide, avalanche or snow slide, steep topography or any other natural or environmental hazard, feature or condition of potential harm to the health, safety or welfare of the future residents of the proposed subdivision or to the Town. 
(c)  The Town may deem land premature for subdivision when subdivision approval would create growth patterns of such physical form and size that governmental inefficiencies, duplication of facilities and unnecessary public costs and financial burdens may result from providing the extension of public services, and completion of support facilities cannot be accomplished in a planned, ordered or efficient manner. 
(d)  No subdivision shall be approved which includes elements not in conformance with the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan, other Town master plans or standards, any applicable zoning ordinance or other ordinance of the Town or any law or regulation of the State and other standards. 
(Ord. 2009-18 §5) 
Sec. 4-5-4. - Control over platting. 
(a)  No subdivision shall be scheduled for review by the Planning Commission until the Community Development Department receives a copy of public notice for a community meeting that has been held and list of addresses of property owners in accordance with the public notice requirements in Article VII of this Chapter. 
(b)  The Town Council shall withhold all public street improvements and public maintenance from all rights-of-way which have not been accepted for maintenance and ownership purposes by the Town. 
(c)  Prior to the issuance of a building permit or construction of any building or structure within a subdivision, the plat thereof shall be approved by the Town Council and recorded with the County Clerk and Recorder. This provision shall not apply to condominium plats. In the case of a condominium, a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for any condominium without prior approval and recording of a condominium plat. 
(d)  The Town Council may suspend or withdraw any approval of a plan or plat or may require that certain corrective measures be taken following a determination that the information provided by the subdivider upon which such approval was based is substantially false or inaccurate or significant new information has been brought to its attention. Suspension of approval may occur at any step in the platting process at a public meeting. 
(1)  A written notice from the Community Development Department shall be served upon the subdivider, setting out a clear and concise statement of alleged facts and directing the subdivider to appear before the Town Council no less than ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days after the date of notification. 
(2)  The Town Council shall determine at the public meeting the nature and extent of alleged false or inaccurate information, shall consider any significant new information that has been brought to its attention, and shall have the power, upon good cause being shown, to suspend or withdraw any approval resulting in a voided plat. 
(e)  No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions shall be made on the final plat after the approval by the Town Council, except as required by the approval of the Town Council or upon approval of the Community Development Director. 
(f)  No plat for subdivided land shall be approved by the Town Council unless all ad valorem taxes applicable to such subdivided land, for years prior to the year in which approval is granted, have been paid. 
(g)  It is unlawful to file for recording any such plan or plat as identified above in any public office unless it has been reviewed by the Planning Commission and bears, by endorsement or otherwise, the approval of the Town Council or Community Development Director where appropriate. 
(h)  The Town Council may, pursuant to rules and regulations or resolution, exempt from the definition of the terms subdivision and subdivided land any division of land if the Town Council determines that such division is not within the purposes of this Article. 
(i)  No lot, tract or parcel of land created as part of a final platted single-family residential subdivision shall be permitted to be further subdivided, notwithstanding Zoning District Standards regarding minimum lot size. This restriction on further subdivision of lots in a final platted single-family residential subdivision shall not apply to residential subdivisions for which the final plat expressly permits further subdivision, but only to the degree so permitted on such plat. 
(j)  Lot line vacations or lot consolidations which would have the effect of reducing the number of lots, tracts or parcels of land within a final platted single-family residential subdivision are permitted; provided, however, that, in that event, a restrictive covenant, in a form approved by the Town, shall be recorded prohibiting the resubdivision of additional lots beyond the number of lots established at the time of and as a condition of the lot line vacation or lot consolidation. 
(Ord. 2009-18 §5) 
Sec. 4-5-5. - Development standards. 
    The following standards shall apply to all new subdivisions of land in the Town, thereby resulting in the creation of lots which are developable in conformance with this Development Code, final plat restrictions, the Town Building Code, the Engineering Standards, other applicable Town regulations and master plans. 
(1)  Subdivision lot and block standards. 
a.  The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
1.  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
2.  Convenient and safe access and circulation, including access and circulation for emergency, maintenance and service vehicles. 
3.  Applicable zoning regulations regarding lot sizes and dimensions. 
4.  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated. 
5.  Availability of utility service and utility system design and capacity. 
b.  The width, depth, shape and orientation of lots shall be designed appropriately for the location and configuration of the property and for the type of use contemplated. 
1.  No lots shall be platted in areas subject to flooding except in conformance with Town Code floodplain development regulations and requirements. 
2.  Whenever a development is proposed for an area designated in a Town officially adopted plan as a public area for future development or open space, the developer or owner may be required to dedicate to the Town, or to reserve such public area for purchase by an appropriate public agency. 
3.  All lots shall front on a public street or highway or private street with easements guaranteeing public access. 
4.  Depth and width of lots shall be adequate to provide the necessary private service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. 
5.  Lots shall be designed to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. 
6.  Corner lots shall generally be adequate in size to compensate for two (2) street frontages and required vehicular sight triangles as stated in the Engineering Standards. 
7.  Side lot lines shall be preferred at right angles to the street line or at right angles to the tangent to the curve of the street line. 
8.  Subdivision lots and streets shall be oriented in a manner to ensure location of structures and landscaping in the most energy-efficient manner.

(2)  All land proposed for subdivision shall comply with Article IV of this Chapter. 
(3)  Utilities to be underground. No subdivision shall be approved unless the plans and specifications provide all utilities to be placed underground. The cost of such undergrounding of utilities shall be paid solely by the subdivider and shall be installed subject to the plans, specifications and approval of the electric, natural gas, telephone and cable television utilities providing the service to the subject property and to any other utility designated to the Town. 
(Ord. 2009-18 §5) 
Sec. 4-5-6. - General requirements. 
(a)  Description of the subdivision process. 
(1)  Preapplication conference, Section 4-5-7, is the first step in the subdivision process. The preapplication conference is intended to provide the applicant with a means of understanding regulations, policies and procedures prior to making a formal submission. 
(2)  Preliminary Plan and Final Plat. The two (2) steps required to obtain approval of a residential subdivision are: (1) Preliminary Plan - a review of preliminary technical engineering, feasibility of the project design, legal ability to obtain water and sanitation, location of geologic hazards, identification of environmentally sensitive areas and wildlife habitat areas, locations of parks, open space, source of required services, vehicular and pedestrian circulation, conformance with the Town Comprehensive Plan, other approved master plans and zoning requirements; (2) Final Plat - a review of all final engineering, execution of a subdivision improvements agreement, provision of a letter of credit or cash to secure the construction of the public improvements described in the subdivision improvements agreement and other legal requirements. 
(3)  Each step is a distinct process. Preliminary Plan and Final Plat involve the submittal of an application, an application fee, required plans and reports, referrals of the proposal to other agencies, community meetings and public hearings/meetings. At each step of the process, the level of design and engineering increases in order to relieve the applicant from major and potentially unnecessary expenses in situations that may require a redesign and, therefore a revision of expensive engineering or planning reports. Approval at any step in the process does not ensure approval at the next step. 
(4)  Minor subdivision and townhome subdivision plats. A minor subdivision plat process can be used for single-family residential when four (4) or fewer lots are being created. A townhome subdivision plat process will follow the minor subdivision process and can be used for any number of Townhome units. A minor subdivision plat or townhome subdivision plat shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission at a public hearing and reviewed and approved by the Town Council at a public hearing according to Section 4-1-22 of this Chapter. 
(5)  Commercial subdivision plats. Require a preapplication conference and Final Plat review according to Section 4-1-22. The Final Plat shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission at a public hearing and reviewed and approved by the Town Council at a public hearing, according to Section 4-1-22. 
(6)  Condominium Plat. The Condominium Plat process can be used to subdivide individual units within a building or buildings and related common elements. 
(7)  If any proposed plan or plat is denied by the Town Council, a new subdivision application for the same or substantially the same request, as determined by the Community Development Director, shall not be accepted within one (1) year of such denial.(b) Applicant's responsibility. The applicant or representative is responsible for understanding the requirements and procedures contained in this Article, the Town Comprehensive Plan and applicable zoning regulations; and is responsible for attending all Planning Commission and Town Council hearings/meetings at which the request is considered. Failure to attend the hearings/meetings may result in the request being denied or tabled and a new hearing/meeting date scheduled. The applicant is responsible for submitting the information requested by staff for the review of the proposal. 
(c)  Additional review fees. The applicant shall be responsible for payment of reasonable review fees as established under Appendix A. 
(d)  Withdrawal of application. The applicant may withdraw an application at any phase of the process upon submittal of a written request to the Community Development Department. 
(e)  Inactive files. Any application for subdivision that becomes inactive, whereby the applicant is required to submit additional information or request a hearing date and has failed to do so, for a period of more than six (6) months, shall become void, and the resubmittal of a new application and fees shall be required to pursue the subdivision request. The Community Development Director may grant no more than two (2) extensions of time, of no more than three (3) months each, upon a written request by the applicant. After five (5) months, the staff planner shall notify the applicant in writing that the application will become void within thirty (30) days. After thirty (30) days, provided that the applicant has not submitted the required additional information or requested a hearing date, the staff planner shall notify the applicant in writing that the application is void. This provision shall apply to all applications on file with the Town upon the effective date of adoption, October 28, 2009, and any application thereafter. 
(Ord. 2009-18 §5) 
Sec. 4-5-7. - Preapplication conference. 
(a)  Intent. This stage of review is designed to provide the applicant with a means of understanding regulations, policies and procedures prior to any formal submission of a proposal being made and to learn whom they have to contact and work with in the process. The Community Development Department will arrange for any joint meetings with other offices/departments, when they are appropriate, so that discussion of a proposal can occur at one (1) time with the applicant rather than having meetings occur at separate times with each person or department involved. 
(b)  Procedure. 
(1)  The applicant shall make an appointment with the Community Development Department to discuss the proposal being considered. The Community Development Department should be provided with some information to determine whether or not other departments need to be involved in the initial discussion. 
(2)  The Community Development Department shall then arrange for an informal meeting, so that the applicant can discuss the proposal. 
(3)  The informal meeting will be held with the applicant providing a brief presentation of the proposal to those present. The goal is then to have a constructive dialogue occur and for the applicant to receive some guidance with respect to a formal application to the Town at a later time. 
(4)  Should the applicant decide to proceed further, formal submission of a complete application, based upon the recommendation of the Community Development Department, Town regulations and the applicant's desires should then occur. 
(Ord. 2009-18 §5) 
Sec. 4-5-8. - Reserved. 
Sec. 4-5-9. - Preliminary Plan. 
(a)  Intent. 
(1)  The purpose of the Preliminary Plan is to examine the feasibility of a project, determine legal ability to obtain water and sanitation, determine location of geologic hazards, identification of environmentally sensitive areas, identification of wetland and wildlife habitat areas, determine conformance with the Town Comprehensive Plan, other master plans, zoning requirements and requirements of this Article, and review the technical design and improvements requirements of the Town ensuring that the standards imposed on the proposed subdivision can be met. Additionally, the Planning Commission and the Town Council shall review the proposal for site planning characteristics and compatibility with adjoining land uses. The detailed review at this stage will help determine if the plan complies with zoning requirements, circulation patterns, desired open space and other applicable plans, master plans, standards and regulations. 
(2)  Applicants are required to include details of the areas two hundred (200) feet adjacent to the land included in the Preliminary Plan. The purpose is to show planned road connections, open space connections, adequate park facilities and utility extensions.

The applicant shall distribute any revised plans, as required by staff. 
(4)  The services and facilities provided by the referral agencies below shall be considered by the Planning Commission and Town Council as a factor in approval of the Preliminary Plan. The criteria for evaluating sufficiency of the services that must be satisfied for the approval of the Plan shall be provided to the Planning Commission and the Town Council as a part of any referral response. All Preliminary Plan applications may be submitted to Town departments and other agencies for review and comment if, in the opinion of the Community Development Department, the agency may be affected by the application or if comments by the agency will ensure a thorough analysis of the application. A list of review agencies is maintained and available at the Community Development Department. 
(5)  A public community meeting shall be held by the applicant for review by the public, prior to the Planning Commission hearing the application. This meeting will require a public notice and notification of all property owners within two hundred (200) feet of the subject property. Notice of the community meeting shall be published one (1) time in a newspaper of general circulation, and such notice will be placed in the "Public Notice" section of that newspaper. Public notice must be published at least seven (7) days prior to the scheduled community meeting, and property owner notification must be mailed first class at least ten (10) days prior to the scheduled community meeting. 
(6)  Referral agencies shall comment in writing within twenty-five (25) days of receiving a complete submittal. The Community Development Department shall forward referral comments to the applicant in a timely manner. The failure of any agency to respond within twenty-five (25) days shall for the purpose of the hearings be considered no comment on the plan by that agency. 
(7)  The staff planner will review the referral comments and discuss the concerns with the applicant. The applicant shall address each issue identified by the referral agencies and revise the plan as needed. The revised plan must comply with all technical and/or regulatory requirements of the referral agencies and shall include a narrative that addresses each revision. Referral agencies shall comment in writing within fifteen (15) days of receiving the revised plan. Should subsequent revisions be required, each revision shall follow the process described herein. 
(8)  Once all issues have been satisfactorily addressed, the staff planner shall notify the applicant of the scheduled public hearing date and time and prepare a staff report for the Planning Commission. 
(9)  The Town shall be responsible for providing public notice prior to the Planning Commission public hearing in compliance with the public notice requirements in Article VII of this Chapter. 
(10)  The Planning Commission shall evaluate the application, referral comments, staff report and public testimony, and make a recommendation to the Town Council to approve, approve with conditions, continue for additional information or for further study or deny the Preliminary Plan. The burden shall be on the applicant to present sufficient evidence that the criteria contained in Subsection (d) of this Section have been satisfied. The Planning Commission's decision shall be based on the evidence presented, and compliance with the criteria for a Preliminary Plan described in Subsection (d) of this Section. 
(11)  Following the recommendation by the Planning Commission, the staff planner will schedule the Preliminary Plan for a public hearing with the Town Council and notify the applicant of the hearing date and time. 
(12)  The Town shall be responsible for providing public notice prior to the Town Council hearing in compliance with the public notice requirements in this Chapter.

(Ord. 2009-18 §5) 
Sec. 4-5-16. - Public dedications. 
(a)  Purpose. The requirements of this Section are imposed to ensure that the increased needs for public parks, open space and trails made necessary by new residential development are borne by the applicants for such development. In order to determine the nature and quantity of such needs, and to provide a mechanism for determining that the amount, kind and location of such required dedications will be roughly proportional to the increase in public parks, open space and trails needs caused by new development, the Town caused the preparation of the "Silverthorne Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan," January 2001 (the "Plan"). The Plan was adopted on January 10, 2001, by the Town Council as a component of the Town's Comprehensive Plan. Copies of the Plan are available in the office of the Community Development Department. The recommendations of the Plan shall be used as the basis for determining the amount, kind and location of required dedication of parks, trails and open space land under this Section, based upon an individualized determination of the increased need for such lands generated by each individual proposed residential development. 
(b)  Intent. This Section is intended to provide adequate sites for the location of public facilities necessitated by the impacts created by new development. Such sites may be dedicated to the Town, special district or homeowners' association for eventual construction and maintenance. The intent is to require appropriate mitigation in proportion to the impacts being created by new development. For any development zoned as planned unit development or where an annexation agreement requires the dedication of land for public purposes, this Section shall require the dedication of additional land to fulfill the entire dedication required herein. 
(c)  General requirements. The developer shall provide for the construction of, at no cost to the Town, all roads adjacent to the area being platted in conformance with the Town Comprehensive Plan, all roads adjacent to publicly dedicated sites, traffic signalization to serve the site, extensions of all utilities to the site and other public infrastructure as required by the Town Council. Security needed to ensure such improvements shall be required at the time of final platting as requested by the Town Council. All park and trail development and facilities shall conform to the standards and criteria as outlined in the Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan. 
(d)  Public improvements generally. 
(1)  In each new subdivision, the Town Council shall determine the type, location and extent of necessary public improvements depending upon the characteristics of the proposed development and its relationship to surrounding areas. Improvements shall be made by the applicant at the applicant's expense and shall be designed by a qualified professional engineer in accordance with the Engineering Standards and other applicable regulations. 
(2)  Proposed improvements, including but not limited to all streets and road rights-of-way, shall conform to the requirements of effective Town master plans, the Engineering Standards, the Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan, the Town Building Code and all other regulations pertaining to the development of land. 
(3)  Other reasonable improvements, not specifically mentioned herein and found appropriate and necessary by the Town Council, shall be constructed at the developer's expense within such time and in conformance with such specifications as deemed necessary and appropriate. 
(e)  Parks, trails and open space. Whenever land is proposed for residential or nonresidential subdivision, the developer shall provide land or cash in lieu of land for active and specialized recreation generated by the proposed use. In general, these lands shall be suitable for the development of active play areas, trails or in some instances to serve to preserve unique landforms or natural areas. Where no suitable land is available in a residential or nonresidential development, cash in lieu of land or the equivalent monetary value or the donation of recreation facilities may be substituted at the Town's discretion. Additional dedication for open space may be recommended by the Town Council if deemed necessary to preserve areas of special significance. 
(1)  The minimum amount of land dedication required in residential developments is six (6) acres of developed park land per one thousand (1,000) population as recommended in the Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan. The Town Council reserves the right to adjust the acreage requirement as deemed necessary to meet specific needs and to determine the amount of developed park acreage required based upon recommendations by the Recreation and Culture Department and the SPORT Committee. 
(2)  Within nonresidential developments and nonresidential components of a planned unit development, provision for park facilities within nonresidential developments is encouraged. 
(3)  For the purposes of calculating the required dedication, existing dwelling units within a subdivision shall be excluded from the calculation of the park requirement. 
(4)  Land proposed for park dedication shall be clearly identified on any submitted plat, including the number of acres for each site and the total acreage proposed for Town park dedication within the project. 
(5)  The conveyance of dedicated park land to the Town shall be by warranty deed, and the title shall be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, including real property taxes prorated to the time of conveyance. The subdivider shall provide the Town with a title insurance policy in the Town's name at the time of conveyance. Dedicated park land shall include the necessary water rights or other available water service to provide for irrigation and drinking water. Community and neighborhood park land shall be conveyed at the time of recordation of the final plat. 
(6)  The developer shall assume all responsibility of development of all parks and trails, unless otherwise determined by the Town. A park facilities master plan shall be submitted to the Town prior to the time of final plat submittal. Upon approval of the park facilities plan by the Town, cost estimates and construction documents shall be submitted. 
(7)  Cash in lieu of land dedication or off-site land dedications shall be used in cases in which the cash value of park land dedication and park development costs is deemed, by the Town Council, to be more appropriate in satisfying the needs of the residents of the proposed development than land. Such cases include, but are not limited to, small developments not able to meet the minimum size requirement and developments which already have adjacent facilities that could be expanded to satisfy the need created by the proposed development. In those subdivisions where proposed regional trails are located, no cash in lieu of land will be accepted unless there is an acceptable alternate route as shown in the Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan. 
(8)  The cash-in-lieu-of-land dedication and park development costs fee shall be determined by the following process. 
a.  The Town Recreation and Culture Department shall review all cash-in-lieu-of-land requests and make a recommendation to the Town Council. 
b.  The Town Council shall make a final determination of the method in which the dedication requirements shall be satisfied. 
c.  When cash-in-lieu-of-land dedication and park development costs are requested by the Town Council, the following formula shall be used: 
Total acreage for dedication x $Value/acre as determined by market value + Park improvement costs for total acreage = Amount required  
d.  When the combination of land and cash in lieu of land is requested by the Town Council, the following formula shall be used: 
Total park dedication in acres - Land acreage accepted = Total acreage for dedication as cash in lieu  
Total acreage for dedication as cash in lieu x $ Value/acre as determined by market value plus development costs/acre = Total acreage for dedication as cash in lieu  
e.  The cash-in-lieu fee shall be equivalent to the full market value of the acreage required for park land dedication. Value shall be based on anticipated market value after completion of platting and construction of public improvements. The applicant shall submit a proposal for the cash-in-lieu fee and supply the information necessary for the Town Council to evaluate the adequacy of the proposal. This information shall include at least one (1) appraisal of the property by a qualified appraiser. 
(9)  Disposing of park lands obtained through these dedication requirements shall be through the Town Council at a public hearing as required by the Town Charter. 
(10)  Cash-in-lieu fees shall be held by the Town until such time as a park plan and development schedule, including costs for development and ongoing maintenance, are established. 
(11)  Credit towards park land dedication requirements may be considered for the following: 
a.  Consideration may be given for meeting a portion of park land dedication requirements through the provision of specialized recreation facilities, provided that such facilities: 
1.  Are available to the general public; 
2.  Will meet a demonstrated public need; and 
3.  Replace or supplement facilities that would generally by provided by the Town. 
b.  Consideration may be given for meeting a portion of park land dedication requirements through dedication or purchase and subsequent dedication of off-site land (land not contiguous to the development), provided that such land: 
1.  Will meet a demonstrated public need; and 
2.  Meets the selection criteria for a neighborhood park, community park or trail as provided in Paragraph (12) below. 
c.  Consideration may be given for meeting a portion of park land dedication requirements through the provision of private open land if such land is restricted for park, recreation or open space purposes by conservation easement or restricted deed, provided that such land: 
1.  Will meet a demonstrated public need; and 
2.  Meets the selection criteria for a neighborhood park, community park, trail or open land as provided in Paragraph (12) below. 
d.  Consideration may be given for meeting a portion of park land dedication requirements through the provision of park and recreation facilities by developers, special districts and homeowners' associations. 
(12)  Selection criteria. 
a.  Community parks: recommended guidelines for sizes of community parks are listed in the Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan. Land may be considered for acceptance for community park land dedication requirements if the following criteria are met: 
1.  Sufficient flat surface to provide for development of active recreation areas as deemed necessary to meet the needs of the respective service area; 
2.  Land will not be considered for community park land dedication if it is an exclusive utility or other easement, public street right-of-way or pedestrian walkway required under other regulations, or contains topographical or hazardous obstructions that would preclude development as a community park; 
3.  Area to be dedicated shall offer natural and scenic quality and can support both active and passive recreational activities for Town residents; and 
4.  Areas containing lakes, ponds or reservoirs may be considered, provided that such area does not exceed one-half (1/2) of the dedication requirement and the area is contiguous to other acceptable park land. 
b.  Neighborhood parks: recommended guidelines for sizes of neighborhood parks are listed in the Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan. Land may be considered for acceptance for neighborhood park land dedication requirements if the following criteria are met: 
1.  Shall contain sufficient flat surface to provide for development of active recreation areas as deemed necessary to meet the needs of the respective service area; 
2.  Land will not be considered for local park land dedication if it is an exclusive utility or other easement, public street right-of-way or pedestrian walkway required under other regulations, or contains topographical or hazardous obstructions that would preclude development as a neighborhood park; and 
3.  Where feasible, a neighborhood park site may be considered for co-locating with a school site in order to benefit from shared facilities such as parking lots, access roads, play fields and other facilities, thereby reducing the overall acreage requirement by a factor equal to those shared facilities. 
c.  Pocket parks: recommended guidelines for sizes of pocket parks are listed in the Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan. Land may be considered for a pocket park if the following criteria are met: 
1.  Land will not be considered for a pocket park if it is an exclusive utility or other easement, public street right-of-way or pedestrian walkway required under other regulations, or contains topographical or hazardous obstructions that would preclude development as a pocket park; and 
2.  Maintenance of these parks shall be the responsibility of the Town, and these parks shall be developed to Town standards. 
d.  Trails: credit may be given for trails against the park land dedication requirements. Provision of trails is considered a normal element of an appropriately planned unit development. The following are considerations for design criteria for trails: 
1.  Alignment provides linkages for the community to local parks, schools and other activity areas; 
2.  Alignment provides linkages for the community to regional parks, trails or open lands as specified in the Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan; 
3.  Trails shall be designed to provide for easy, safe and secure usage and allow for sufficient easement or right-of-way to accommodate multiple uses; and 
4.  Land should not be considered for trail dedication acceptance if it is an exclusive utility or other easement, public street right-of-way or pedestrian walkway required under other regulations, or contains topographical or hazardous obstructions that would preclude development of a trail. 
e.  Open space: the Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan recommends that ten percent (10%) of the gross site area of a development be set aside as open space. Land shall be required to be set aside as open land during the subdivision process. The amount set aside will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending upon density, lot sizes and characteristics of the land, with the goal of achieving ten percent (10%) of the site as open space. Open space as shown on approved development plans which is adjacent to the area proposed for subdivision platting, or as otherwise identified during the subdivision process, shall be included in the areas proposed for subdivision platting. Land set aside as open space shall include, at a minimum, areas identified in the Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan. In addition, the following land will be required to be set aside if it serves one (1) or more of the following functions: 
1.  To identify or separate municipalities, communities or subdivisions or to provide expansive visual relief from development; 
2.  To buffer or provide transitions between different land uses; 
3.  To preserve or protect: 
a)  Environmental areas: areas including but not limited to one-hundred-year floodplains, wetlands, wildlife habitat. 
b)  Significant natural landforms: areas including but not limited to prominent landforms such as rock outcroppings, buttes, mesas, lakes, streams and drainageways. 
c)  Significant natural vegetation areas: areas including but not limited to one-hundred-year floodplains, drainageways, wildlife corridors, migration routes and calving areas. 
d)  Important wildlife habitat areas: areas including but not limited to one-hundred-year floodplains, drainage ways, wildlife corridors, migration routes and calving areas. 
e)  Geologic hazard areas: areas including but not limited to expansive soils and related conditions, soil erosion areas and unstable slopes.

(4)  Ingress and egress. The purpose of the Subsection is to allow for safe ingress and egress to off-street parking, to allow for adequate room for off-street snow storage to be used by the Town's Public Works Department and to locate the driveways so as to reduce the possibilities of traffic hazards. The ingress and egress provisions for off-street parking spaces shall conform to the following minimum standards. The Public Works Department may recommend a reduction in the standards if it finds that his requirement is not justified by the characteristics of the proposed ingress and egress: 
a.  Intersections. No portion of any entrance or exit driveway leading from or to a public street, highway or alley for the purpose of off-street parking shall be closer than thirty-five (35) feet to an intersection of two (2) or more public streets, alleys or highways. The intersection point shall be determined by the crossing of two (2) rights-of-way or curbline or two (2) physically established edges of the public street, alley or highway, whichever is more restrictive. 
b.  Width of driveways. The width of any driveway connecting an off-street parking area with a public street, alley or highway in all zone districts, except C-2, Heavy Commercial District, shall not exceed twenty-four (24) feet at its intersection with the property line, curbline, right-of-way or the physically established edge of the public street, alley or highway, whichever is most restrictive.

d.  Angle of intersection. All driveways serving off-street parking facilities shall intersect public streets, alleys and other driveways at a ninety-degree angle, with the exception in residential areas of driveways serving up to four (4) dwelling units. 
e.  Accessibility. All off-street parking stalls shall have legal, unobstructed access to a public street or alley. 
f.  Forward-flow movement. Except for single-family and duplex parking areas, all other parking stalls shall be so designed, located and served by maneuvering lanes or spaces that their use will under no circumstances require a backing movement onto any public street or alley. 
g.  Visual clearance. All driveways leading to and from off-street spaces that intersect possible pedestrian ways shall be visually unobstructed for such distances so as not to imperil pedestrians or interfere with vehicular traffic on the street. 
h.  Traffic. The location and number of driveways must be so arranged that they will reduce the possibilities of traffic hazards as much as possible. Wheel or bumper guards may be provided but must be so located and arranged that no part of any parked vehicle extends beyond the boundaries of the parking area. 
i.  Grades. Except for facilities serving single-family and duplex uses or structures, the sustained surface grades for parking facilities shall not be less than five-tenths percent (0.5%) for Portland cement concrete surfaces, not less than one percent (1%) for asphalt surfaces or more than four percent (4%) for either surface. 
j.  Drainage. Facilities shall be graded for proper drainage so that surface discharge is channeled to a natural or improved drainageway without causing nuisance or damage to other properties or the improvements thereon. Proper drainage shall include the installation of such systems, including culverts if necessary, and will protect all affected public rights-of-way. Culverts shall be corrugated metal pipe or High-Density Poly Ethylene (HDPE) with a minimum eighteen-inch diameter or equivalent "squash" diameter unless otherwise approved by the Town in writing. 
k.  Surfacing required. Facilities and driveways shall be surfaced concrete, asphaltic concrete or asphalt (for all uses), except for facilities serving single-family or duplex dwelling units, or parking facilities for recreational uses, which facilities may be surfaced with a dust-free surfacing material and must be maintained in good condition, free of weeds, dust, trash and debris. For the purpose of this Section, recreational uses means parking that is provided for fishing access, softball, baseball and soccer fields and overflow parking for special events. For facilities serving triplex and fourplex units, the Town Council shall determine if the parking area should be hard-surfaced. Among the factors which will be considered in such determination are soil conditions, density of development and surfacing proposed. 
l.  Concrete curb and gutter required. All off-street parking surfaces shall be defined by concrete curb and gutter (for all uses), except for facilities serving single-family or duplex dwelling units. The Community Development Department and/or the Public Works Department may waive this requirement if it finds that this requirement is not justified by the characteristics of the proposed development. 
m.  Location. Facilities for commercial uses which abut residential uses shall not be closer to the adjoining residential zone district boundary than ten (10) feet. Facilities serving residential or commercial uses shall not be closer to the property line than ten (10) feet. 
n.  Screening. Facilities adjacent to residential structures shall be equipped with barriers or screens sufficient to prevent unreasonable disturbance to the occupants of such structures arising from the operation or use of the facility. Where the facility abuts directly upon a residential lot, a screen at least four (4) feet in height shall be erected. Screens or barriers may be solid walls, fencing or landscaping, whichever is most appropriate to the adjacent properties and accomplishes the purpose of this Article most suitably. 
o.  Snow-stacking space. All surface facilities shall provide a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of total paved surface area. The snow-stacking space must be provided on the same property as the facility. Such space shall be so located as to reasonably facilitate the snow-plowing process. Landscaping in or around a snow-stacking space shall not interfere with the snow-stacking process. The space shall be located upon the site so as to comply with the maintenance criteria set forth in the Section below. 
p.  All required parking spaces, excluding single and duplex units, facing and abutting a building, wall, fence, property line or walkway shall be provided with curb, bumper or wheel stops. Such devices shall be constructed and installed in conformance with adopted Town standards. 
(f)  Parking requirement exceptions and reductions: It is the intent of this Subsection that all structures and land uses be provided with a sufficient amount of off-street parking, while allowing for some flexibility of site design to accommodate the unique characteristics of individual properties. This Section sets standards for conditions under which and exception of reduction of the general parking requirements may be allowed. The Community Development Director may require the submission of a parking demand analysis as part of any request for an exception or reduction from the general parking requirements. When multiple reductions are proposed, each subsequent reduction will be taken from the subtotal of the previous reduction. 
(1)  Location of required parking spaces. All required facilities shall be provided on the same lot as the building or use served, except that up to fifty percent (50%) of the parking spaces required to serve business and commercial uses may be located within a three hundred-foot radius of the subject property, measured from any point on the property. If the building or use and parking area are not owned by the same owner, the owner shall submit, for approval by the Town Attorney, a binding covenant affording the use of the parking area. All required parking for residential uses shall be provided on the same lot as the residential use served. 
(2)  Shared parking. No off-street parking space required for any building or use for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this Chapter shall be included as part of the off-street parking space required for another building or use. Provided, however, that projects consisting of a mix of a minimum of two (2) non-residential uses may reduce the aggregate parking required for the non-residential portion of the project by up to thirty percent (30%), if the combination of uses have peak parking demands during different times of the day. For example, uses such as theaters, public auditoriums, bowling alleys, bars, movie theaters and similar predominantly evening uses may share parking with uses such as banks, offices, and similar predominantly daytime uses. The applicant requesting shared parking reductions shall submit a parking study that details peak parking demands for the uses proposed, and demonstrates that shared parking will function effectively. 
(3)  Parking reduction for proximity to a bus stop. Upon approval by Town Council, business, commercial and educational uses located within five hundred (500) feet of a Summit Stage Bus Service Stop or Transit Center may reduce the minimum number of required parking spaces by fifteen percent (15%) if all of the following criteria are met: 
a.  There is reliable, regularly scheduled service during commuting hours, year-round. 
b.  There is safe and convenient pedestrian access from the bus stop to the subject building or property. 
c.  For commercial and business uses, the applicant provides a parking management plan that will encourage employees to use the bus service and provides alternatives in the event that the bus stop is relocated. 
(4)  Parking reduction for provision of bicycle parking. Bicycle parking may substitute for up to five percent (5%) of the required parking in the ratio of seven (7) bicycle parking spaces for each one (1) required parking space. Each bicycle parking space must be at least two (2) feet by six (6) feet. In order to qualify for this reduction, there must be safe and convenient bike access to the property. 
(5)  Parking reductions for the Town Core. In those instances where the applicant for a development permit within the Town Core District desires not to provide all parking spaces required in this Chapter, the applicant may apply for a reduction in the order set forth below. The reductions set forth below apply exclusively to commercial, business, and entertainment uses, including restaurants, bars, retail establishments, offices, auditoriums and theaters, that are listed as permitted uses in the underlying zone district. 
a.  The minimum number of parking spaces set in Paragraph 4-6-10(d)(2) above may be reduced by up to twenty-five percent (25%). 
b.  The minimum number of parking spaces set in Paragraph 4-6-10(d)(2) above may be provided, on a 1:1 ratio, by the construction of on-street parking in locations approved by the Town within the Town Core. 
c.  In the event that the minimum number of off-street parking spaces for a development project cannot be met by Subsections (a) and (b) above, the applicant may choose to enter into an agreement with the Town to provide deficient parking spaces at a later date through participation in a Town Core Parking District. 
The right of an applicant to enter into such an agreement, and the authority of the Town to accept such agreement, shall be subject to the following limitations: 
1.  Agreement. The agreement shall specify the number of spaces the project is deficient, shall indicate the applicant's agreement not to protest the cost for the design and construction of future public parking facilities and shall be entered into prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
2.  Any parking supplied in this manner shall run with the land (not be invalidated by change in ownership), and any subsequent change in use that requires more parking shall require subsequent action by the property owner to satisfy any additional parking requirements. 
(g)  Maintenance standards and criteria. 
(1)  General. Every owner of a parking facility within the Town shall maintain such facility, including the surfacing, drainage, signs, striping, lights and lighting and landscaping, in good repair and in an unobstructed condition so as to ensure its proper use at all times. 
(2)  Snow removal. All operating facility surfaces shall be substantially cleared of snow within twenty-four (24) hours after uncompacted snow depth reaches four (4) inches. Removed snow shall be stored in the designated snow-stacking space in such a manner as not to impair lines of sight or disrupt or obstruct the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic or drainage. 
(h)  Use restrictions. 
(1)  Parking facilities shall be restricted to parking of operable private vehicles of residents, customers, patrons and employees only and shall not be used as permanent parking for resident vehicles, including trailers, mobile homes or vans; for storage of operable or inoperable vehicles or of materials and equipment; or for the parking of trucks or other vehicles used in connection with the business or use on the site. The parking requirements for such excluded vehicles shall be considered in site plan review separate from the consideration for included vehicles. 
(2)  Storage. Except as provided in Subsection (3) below, off-street parking spaces shall not be used for the parking or storage of trailers, boats, detached campers, inoperable vehicles or other objects that will render the parking space unusable. 
(3)  Sales and service. No off-street parking space shall be used for the sale, repair, dismantling or servicing of any vehicle, equipment, materials or supplies, except that this shall not prohibit the servicing or repair of private vehicles by their owners in facilities serving residential uses. 
(i)  Nonconformance. 
(1)  A facility shall be deemed nonconforming if it does not meet the requirements set forth in this Article on the effective date of the applicable section, as shown by the "prior code" notations following each such section. 
(2)  Upon any expansion or modification of the use, structure or site served by said nonconforming facility, when such expansion or modification will cause, in the estimation of the Community Development Department, an increase in the demand for parking spaces, the owner of such use or structure shall be required to bring said facility into conformance with this Section.

Division 2 - Waterbody, Wetland and Riparian Protection Regulations 

Sec. 4-8-11. - Intent. 
    These Waterbody, Wetland and Riparian Protection Regulations are enacted to protect the vital, beneficial functions and values of wetlands and water areas within Silverthorne. This is to be accomplished by requiring that a permit be obtained for development activities in wetlands and water areas, and associated buffer areas, and that, as a part of this permitting process, the Town will review disturbance permits and mitigation plans. A critical element of this process is the determination of the buffer area boundary which will vary from a minimum twenty-five (25) feet and a maximum of one hundred twenty-five (125) feet depending upon the presence of site-specific features and the use of best management practices. It is intended that the buffer width will equal what is necessary to protect the wetlands and water areas from significant adverse impact arising from activities within the buffer and that applicants will be encouraged to reduce the width of the buffer through appropriate best management practices. It is anticipated that where an applicant includes best management practices, the width of this buffer will be decreased below the maximum, and that where these practices will fully mitigate the impact of development within the maximum buffer upon the wetlands or water area, the buffer will be reduced to the minimum of twenty-five (25) feet. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-8-12. - Application. 
    The requirements of this Division shall apply to all site development within a water area, wetlands or buffer zone, including site clearing, grading, excavation and the placement of material, including without limitation any soil, sand, gravel, mineral, aggregate, organic material or the storage of plowed snow. A Disturbance Permit is required for any site development in wetland areas, rivers, streams, ponds, lakes or other water areas in the Town, or within the buffer zone associated with such wetland or water areas. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-8-13. - Enforcement. 
    In addition to other fines and penalties established herein for violations of this Code, the Town may seek an injunction requiring complete restoration of any area disturbed in violation of this Division, or payment in lieu of restoration or mitigation at the rate established in this Division, and may issue stop work orders, withhold any further permits for site development and cease the processing of any site development applications related to the property, project or owner that violates the provisions of this Division. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-8-14. - Compliance with Disturbance Permit. 
    Any site development which is subject to a Disturbance Permit shall at all times comply with the requirements of the Disturbance Permit, including the provisions of a Disturbance Plan and Mitigation Plan. Failure to comply with a Disturbance Permit shall be deemed a violation of this Division. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-8-15. - Definitions. 
    The following definitions shall be used for the application of this Division. 
    Best Management Practices (BMPs). Economically feasible conservation practices and land and water management measures that minimize adverse impacts to the chemical, physical and biological characteristics of water areas and wetlands. BMPs may include a wide range of structural and nonstructural practices to be implemented in association with land disturbance, development and construction activities. 
    Buffer zone means an area adjacent to a water area or wetlands. 
    Disturbance Permit means a permit which authorizes site development activity in a wetland area, water area or associated buffer zone, and includes a Disturbance Plan and Mitigation Plan for site development which results in the fill of wetland areas. 
    Disturbance Plan means the plan for disturbance of wetlands water areas, and any associated buffer zone, as required by this Division. 
    Fen means wetlands dominated by herbaceous hydrophytes receiving water that has passed through mineral soils. Water table levels are high and have pH values greater than 5.0; and have sixteen (16) inches, or more, of organic material in the upper thirty-two (32) inches of surface soil horizon. Organic soils are classified as Histosols by the USDA. 
    Mitigation Plan means the plan for mitigation of impacted wetland or water areas as required by this Division. 
    Riparian area means that transition area between aquatic and terrestrial (upland) environments influenced by the high water table associated with a stream or river. Plant types typically associated with riparian areas include hydrophytes (obligate, facultative wet and facultative species) and phreatophytes (typical plants include, but are not limited to, cottonwoods, willows, alders, aspens and chokecherry). Riparian areas are commonly recognized by the combination of high species diversity, high species densities and high productivity. 
    Silverthorne SAMP means a Special Area Management Plan for the Silverthorne area for wetlands protection and management approved by the Army Corps of Engineers. 
    Water area means a wetlands perennial or intermittent river, stream, lake, reservoir or pond, whether natural or artificial. The following water features are excluded: irrigation and roadway drainage ditches; artificial lakes and ponds which are not tributary to state waters or are created and used for the primary purposes of agricultural activities or stormwater treatment; and development water features less than one half (1/2) acre in surface area. A "perennial" river, stream, reservoir or pond is one that normally holds water or flows continuously during all the calendar year as a result of groundwater discharge or surface run-off. An "intermittent" river, stream, reservoir or pond is one that is defined as such by the U.S. Geological Survey and may be shown as intermittent water features on the U.S. Geological Survey 7.5 Minute Series Topographical maps. 
    Waterbody, Wetland and Riparian Protection Plan or Protection Plan means a plan to be created and adopted by the Town, to be incorporated into the Town's Comprehensive Plan, which designates wetland areas of intermediate and exceptional resource and appropriate variable outer buffer zones on a site specific basis, which is adopted after providing written notice to affected property owners and conducting a public hearing thereon. 
    Wetland means an area delineated as a wetland by the Army Corps of Engineers or defined as a wetland by the Army Corps of Engineers delineation manual; however, wetlands do not include areas which are saturated solely due to required storm water detention or irrigation water. (Army Corps defines wetlands areas as areas which are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a minimum frequency and duration, that contain hydric soils and vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation, including but not limited to: willows, rushes, sedges, cattails and cottonwoods.) (Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-8-16. - Purpose. 
(a)  Wetland and water areas. Preservation of wetland and water areas serves to prevent water quality degradation of the Blue River and its tributaries (a state designated gold medal trout river), and the several ponds and lakes in Town; to protect ecosystems, aquatic habitats and wildlife habitats, especially habitats for state or federally designated endangered and threatened species; to preserve ground water recharge functions; and to preserve existing natural flood plain control. 
(b)  Buffer zone. The buffer zone serves as an ecological transition zone from uplands to wetlands and water areas which is an integral portion of the wetland and water area ecosystems. Specifically, buffer zones can provide: 
(1)  A temporary refuge for wetland fauna during high water episodes; 
(2)  A habitat area for activities such as breeding, spawning, nesting and wintering for migrating, endangered, commercially and recreationally important wildlife; 
(3)  An area to accommodate slight variations in wetland and water area boundaries over time due to hydrologic and climatologic effects; 
(4)  A remediation and filtration area to remove and store nutrients, sediments, petrochemicals, pesticides, debris and other pollutants as they move from the upland towards the wetlands and water areas; 
(5)  A buffer area to keep disturbances at a distance from wetland and water areas, thus reducing the impact of noise, traffic and other direct and indirect human impacts on wetland species; 
(6)  A corridor area which facilitates the movement of wildlife to and from wetland and water areas and from and to uplands, streams and other waterways; and 
(7)  A sediment and storm water control area to reduce the adverse effects of development or disturbance upon wetland and water areas. 
(Ord. 2003-20 §2) 
Sec. 4-8-17. - Review procedure. 
    Disturbance Permits for site development in wetland areas, water areas and buffer zone areas shall be reviewed and decided by the reviewing entity and by the process for the site development application as designated in Section 4-1-22, and such review may be consolidated with other development applications and procedures as appropriate. The notice and public hearing requirements shall follow the requirements for the site development application.

(2)  Restrictive inner buffer. Twenty-five (25) feet: The buffer zone from water areas and wetlands for any site development application that is not subject to the grandfather clause in Subsection (1) above shall be twenty-five (25) feet. 
(3)  Variable outer buffer zone. Zero (0) to one hundred (100) feet: The variable outer buffer zone for any site is an additional buffer zone beyond the restrictive inner buffer; however, the variable outer buffer zone shall not apply to man-made and artificial ponds. The width of the variable outer buffer zone may be undulating across a piece of property in order to provide protection to site specific features. The width of the variable outer buffer zone shall be determined by the Waterbody, Wetland and Riparian Area Protection Plan; or, if not yet completed and adopted, the variable outer buffer zone shall be determined on a site specific basis with the property owner during the site development application review process subject to the following standards and process. Site-specific features within one hundred twenty-five (125) feet of the water area or wetland boundary, or adjacent land uses that trigger the need for an outer buffer zone are listed below. After the initial determination of the presence of site-specific features that trigger the need for an outer buffer zone, the use of Best Management Practices shall be considered under Subsection (4) below to reduce the width of the variable outer buffer zone. 
a.  Riparian areas. The outer buffer zone shall be coincident with the outermost extent of riparian areas. 
b.  Threatened and endangered species. The presence of occupied, functional habitat for plant and animal species listed by the State of Colorado or United States as threatened or endangered shall result in an outer buffer zone of twenty-five (25) feet to one hundred (100) feet from such habitat. 
c.  Wildlife migration corridor. The presence of a demonstrated wildlife migration corridor as determined by the Colorado Division of Wildlife shall result in an outer buffer zone of twenty-five (25) feet to one hundred (100) feet. 
d.  Fens. The outer buffer zone from fens is one hundred (100) feet. 
e.  Steep slopes. Where a slope of twenty percent (20%) grade or more draining into water areas or wetlands measured one hundred twenty-five (125) feet outward from the water area or wetland exists, the outer buffer shall be one hundred (100) feet; where a slope of thirty percent (30%) grade or more that is ten (10) feet or more in vertical height exists, the outer buffer zone shall be coincident with the area of such slope within one hundred twenty-five (125) feet of such water area or wetlands. 
f.  Erodable soils. Where soils adjacent to water areas or wetlands with an erosion "K" factor of 0.25 or greater, as determined by the Natural Resources Conservation Services ("NRCS") or other qualified expert, exists the outer buffer zone shall be coincident with the area of such soils within one hundred twenty-five (125) feet of such water area or wetland. 
g.  Unstable streambank conditions. Where horizontal or vertical degradation beyond natural levels of river and stream banks exists, the outer buffer zone shall be twenty-five (25) feet. 
h.  Hazardous materials. Where the proposed use of property presents a special hazard to water quality due to storage, handling or use of hazardous or toxic materials, chemical fertilizers or pesticides, not including residential uses, the outer buffer zone shall be one hundred (100) feet. 
i.  Stormwater permit. Where the proposed land use involves commercial or industrial uses that require a CDPS stormwater permit (SIC-based), the outer buffer zone shall be one hundred (100) feet. 
j.  Impervious area. Where the proposed site development would create forty percent (40%) or more impervious surfaces for any one (1) acre area within the potential buffer zone area (including restrictive inner and potential variable outer buffer zone), the outer buffer zones shall be one hundred (100) feet. 
k.  Poor vegetative cover. Where vegetative cover of less than thirty percent (30%) for any one-half (1/2) acre exists within one hundred twenty-five (125) feet of a water area or wetland, the outer buffer zone shall be fifty (50) feet. 
(4)  Reduction of variable outer buffer zone. When Best Management Practices for a proposed site development can be used to prevent, or at a minimum mitigate, degradation of the water quality of water areas, the function of wetlands or the function of the buffer zone, the variable outer buffer zone width will be reduced accordingly. The specific use and development of property shall be considered when considering the appropriateness of reducing the variable outer buffer zone. The function of buffer zones can include: 
a.  Reduction of sediment inflows to water areas or wetlands. 
b.  Regulation of nutrient and organic matter input into water areas and wetlands. 
c.  Reduction of hazardous or toxic material inflows into water areas or wetlands. 
d.  Attenuation of stormwater/ snowmelt flows into water areas and wetland (including changing concentrated flows into sheet flows). 
e.  Habitat for water area or wetland organisms or organisms that use water areas and wetland. 
f.  Groundwater recharge area which helps support a water area or wetland.

CHAPTER 4 
Community Development 
ARTICLE X - Special Districts 

Sec. 4-10-1. - Legislative declaration. 
(a)  Special districts ("Districts") organized under Title 32, Article 1 C.R.S. (the "Special District Act"), under appropriate circumstances, provide an economic alternative to the development of municipal infrastructure at the expense and risk of the Town. The Town has previously authorized Districts within its corporate limits for the sole purpose of development of infrastructure within their respective service areas. In the past, the Town has regulated the authority and autonomy of the Districts through its approving resolutions and intergovernmental agreements. 
(b)  The intent of this Article is to impose conditions, restrictions, standards and requirements on the development of future new and presently existing Districts, and on approval of new service plans and amendments to existing service plans and interests in property (hereinafter included within the concept of service plan amendments) that relate to the development of additional capital infrastructure and the issuance of indebtedness, in order to preserve the financial integrity of the Town and the health, safety, prosperity, security and general welfare of all of the residents and citizens of the Town. The Special District Act and the existing intergovernmental agreements between the Town and the Districts in certain respects do not adequately address the local concerns and interests of the Town in regulating service plans and service plan amendments relating to development of capital facilities and incurrence of debt to finance such development, both of which ultimately have a direct financial consequence to the Town. It is necessary and advisable to specify the events and conditions which, under the Special District Act, may constitute material departures from an approved District service plan. The provisions of this Article are intended to provide procedures for the processing and review of proposals for approval of new service plans and for amendment of existing service plans, and to define the restrictions and limitations which may be imposed by the Town as a condition to the approval of such service plans and service plan amendments consistent with the policy and intent of this Article. 
(c)  The adoption of this Article is necessary, requisite and proper for the government and administration of local and municipal matters under the Town's home rule powers granted by Article XX of the Colorado Constitution. The Town Council specifically finds that it has been granted the authority to approve, conditionally approve or disapprove any service plan from any Special District wholly or partially contained within the boundaries of the Town and that the exercise of such authority within its corporate limits is purely a matter of local concern. See Section 32-1-204.5, C.R.S. 
(d)  The Town reserves all the powers and authority granted to municipalities by the Special District Act. The provisions of this Article shall be construed and applied to supplement the applicable provisions of the Special District Act and, to the extent provided herein, supercede the Special District Act pursuant to the home rule powers granted by Article XX of the Colorado Constitution. 
(Ord. 2001-2 §1; Ord. 2003-20 §3) 
Sec. 4-10-2. - Definitions. 
    As used in this Article, the following terms, phrases and words shall have the following meanings: 
    Board means the Board of Directors of a District. 
    District means a special district organized under the Special District Act whose service plan is to be approved by the Town under applicable state law and any existing District that is located wholly within the corporate limits of the Town as of the effective date of this Article. 
    Petitioners means those persons proposing a service plan or an amendment to an approved service plan. 
(Ord. 2001-2 §1; Ord. 2003-20 §3) 
Sec. 4-10-3. - Required annual report. 
    Not later than September 1 of each calendar year, each District shall file an annual report (the "annual report") with the Town Clerk, the requirements of which may be waived in whole or in part by the Town Council, if such reporting requirements place an undue hardship on such District. The annual report shall reflect activity and financial events of the District through the preceding December 31 (the "report year"). The annual report shall include the following: 
(1)  A narrative summary of the progress of the District in implementing its service plan for the report year; 
(2)  Except when exemption from audit has been granted for the report year under the Local Government Audit Law, the audited financial statements of the District for the report year, including a statement of financial condition (i.e., balance sheet) as of December 31 of the report year and the statement of operations (i.e., revenues and expenditures) for the report year; 
(3)  Unless disclosed within a separate schedule to the financial statements, a summary of the capital expenditures incurred by the District in development of public facilities in the report year, as well as any capital improvements or projects proposed to be undertaken in the five (5) years following the report year; 
(4)  Unless disclosed within a separate schedule to the financial statements, a summary of the financial obligations of the District at the end of the report year, including the amount of outstanding indebtedness, the amount and terms of any new District indebtedness or long-term obligations issued in the report year, the amount of payment or retirement of existing indebtedness of the District in the report year, the total assessed valuation of all taxable properties within the District as of January 1 of the report year, and the current mill levy of the District pledged to debt retirement in the report year; 
(5)  The District's budget for the calendar year in which the annual report is submitted; 
(6)  A summary of residential and commercial development in the District for the report year; 
(7)  A summary of all fees, charges and assessments imposed by the District as of January 1 of the report year; 
(8)  Certification of the Board that no action, event or condition enumerated in Section 4-10-5 has occurred in the report year; and 
(9)  The name, business address and telephone number of each member of the Board and its chief administrative officer and general counsel, together with the date, place and time of the regular meetings of the Board. 
(Ord. 2001-2 §1; Ord. 2003-20 §3) 
Sec. 4-10-4. - Review of annual report. 
    Annually, on a date established by resolution of the Town Council, the Town Council at a regular public meeting may review the annual reports received from each District. In the event the annual report is not timely received by the Town Clerk, notice thereof shall be given by certified mail by the Town Clerk to the Board of such District, at its last known address. The failure of the District to file the annual report within forty-five (45) days of the mailing of such notice by the Town Clerk shall empower the Town Council to impose the sanctions authorized in Section 4-10-21. The remedies provided for noncompliance with the filing of the annual report shall be supplementary to any remedy authorized by the Special District Act. 
(Ord. 2001-2 §1; Ord. 2003-20 §3) 
Sec. 4-10-5. - Material departure. 
    The occurrence of any of the following actions, events or conditions, subsequent to the date of approval of the service plan or most recent amendment thereto, shall constitute a material departure requiring a service plan amendment: 
(1)  The development of any capital facility in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) in cost, which is not either identified in the service plan or authorized by the Town in the course of a separate development approval, excluding bona fide cost projection miscalculations; and state or federally mandated improvements, particularly water or sanitation facilities. 
(2)  The failure of the District to develop, cause to be developed, or consent to the development by others of any capital facility proposed in its service plan when necessary to service approved development within the District that is actually occurring. 
(3)  The occurrence of any event or condition which is defined under the service plan or intergovernmental agreement as necessitating a service plan amendment. 
(4)  The material default by the District under any intergovernmental agreement with the Town. 
(5)  Any of the events or conditions enumerated in Section 32-1-207(2), C.R.S., as amended. 
(Ord. 2001-2 §1; Ord. 2003-20 §3) 
Sec. 4-10-6. - Determination of applicability. 
    Should the District dispute that one (1) or more of the occurrences or conditions asserted by this Town as a material departure is in fact a material departure, the District may request a hearing before the Town Council after consultation with Town staff. After hearing and receipt of any relevant information presented by the District and the recommendation of Town staff, the Town Council shall make a finding as to whether such occurrence constitutes a material departure. In the event it is found a material departure has taken place, the District shall submit its request for an amendment in accordance with this Article, unless waived by the Town Council. Upon a finding that no material departure has taken place, the District shall be relieved from obtaining an amendment. The Town Council may, however, require a later amendment if the change or deviation, on a cumulative basis, subsequently becomes material. In making its determination, the Town Council shall consider, among other relevant information, whether the departure will have a probable adverse financial impact on the Town. 
(Ord. 2001-2 §1; Ord. 2003-20 §3) 
Sec. 4-10-7. - Service plan amendment. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in the approved service plan and except when the Town Council has determined that no material departure has occurred pursuant to Section 4-10-6, within ninety (90) days of the occurrence of an action, event or condition enumerated in Section 4-10-5, the Board shall forward an appropriate petition to the Town Council for approval requesting a service plan amendment. The petition for amendment shall include: 
(1)  All information and documentation required under the applicable provisions of the Special District Act;

(3)  A detailed explanation of the activity, events or conditions which resulted in the material departure, including what action was taken or alternatives considered, if any, by the District to avoid the action, event or condition; 
(4)  The impact of the material departure on the District's ability to develop the capital facilities and infrastructure necessary to meet its capital development plan; 
(5)  The effect of the material departure on the District's ability to retire as scheduled its outstanding financial obligations and its ability to issue and market additional indebtedness, if any;

(8)  An updated five-year capital improvements plan; and

    If any District has not undertaken development of capital facilities or issued any bonds, it may apply to the Town Council for a deferral from compliance with this Article for a period of time not to exceed two (2) years. The Town Council may grant a deferral if the Board submits a resolution to the Town Council stating that upon issuance of the exemption, the District's authorization under the service plan and the intergovernmental agreement with the Town to undertake development of capital facilities or issue any indebtedness or other financial obligation is temporarily suspended. With issuance of the partial deferral, the District shall be excluded from compliance with this Article, except that the District annually, not later than September 1, shall submit financial statements from the previous year and the budget for the current year or file annual reports under Section 4-10-4.

Sec. 5-2-2. - Powers. 
(a)  Review. The Board shall act as an advisory board to the Town Council and in that capacity, it may hold public meetings to solicit public input regarding arts and culture or investments in arts and culture opportunities. It shall review and make recommendations concerning matters related to arts and culture as may be referred to the Board by the Town Council or Town Manager. 
(b)  Liaison. The Board shall act as a liaison between the community and Town Council to enhance community-Town Council relations and to promote public awareness of the Town's arts and culture programs. It shall, from time to time, initiate, prepare and submit recommendations concerning policy matters related to arts and culture to the Town Council, staff and other boards, committees, commissions or entities to apprise the Town Council of the community's needs for investments in arts and culture. 
(c)  Working groups. The Board may at its discretion establish working groups to work on specific projects or tasks. Members of working groups are not members of the Board and need not be appointed by the Town Council. 
(d)  Rules. The Board shall adopt rules for transaction of business. 
(e)  Land use matters. The Board shall have no power or authority to investigate, review, or otherwise participate in land use matters. 
( Ord. No. 2016-05, §1 )

Two (2) of these members will be Town Council representatives, and a majority of the Board shall always be comprised of residents of the Town. Appointments for Board members filling expired terms shall be held at the last regular meeting of the Town Council of the year or at a special meeting called for that purpose. When a re-appointment or replacement is made, the reappointment or replacement shall be considered effective on the date that the prior term expired. A Board member whose term has expired may continue serving until he or she is either re-appointed or until their successor is chosen. 
(c)  Compensation. Board members shall serve without compensation, but may receive reimbursement for necessary travel and other expenses incurred on official duty when such expenditures are required for the efficient dispatch of Board business. 
(d)  Conflicts of interest. Should any Board member represent a project being reviewed, or become affiliated with an owner, developer or builder of a project being reviewed, that Board member shall abstain from any voting and participation on any action or recommendation relating to that project. The reason for abstention should be stated prior to any action taken by the Board. 
(e)  Terms. Board members shall serve terms of three (3) years, and may only serve two consecutive terms. After serving two consecutive terms, a Board member must vacate his or her position for at least one year before seeking re-appointment to another term. There shall be staggered terms of office for Board members so that one third of the Board shall be up for re-appointment each year. The system for staggered terms of membership shall be implemented as follows: one Board member shall have an initial term of one (1) year, two (2) Board members shall have terms of two (2) years, and two (2) Board members shall have terms of three (3) years. Initial Board members serving less than a full three-year term as their initial term shall be considered to have served a full three-year term for purposes of the limits on more than two successive terms.

( Ord. No. 2016-05, §1 )

TOWN OF SILVERTHORNE HOME RULE CHARTER 
1994 
Adopted by the Electorate 
of the Town of Silverthorne 
on April 5, 1994 

> 
PREFATORY STATEMENT 
    The Home Rule Charter Commission for the Town of Silverthorne, Colorado, hereby submits to the Board of Trustees and to the voters a proposed Home Rule Charter which has been framed in accordance with Article XX of the Colorado Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Act of 1971, as amended. 
Objectives 
    The Charter seeks to achieve the following main purposes: 
- to reserve to the Town of Silverthorne the greatest autonomy and power of self-government legally permissible under the Constitution and the laws of the State of Colorado; 
- to establish a structure for the efficient and orderly conduct of the Town government while also providing for and encouraging the fullest possible citizen participation in the affairs of the Town; and 
- to safeguard the well-being of all inhabitants of the Town and set forth the framework for the Town's future growth and development as a quality community. 
Town government 
    To accomplish these objectives, the Charter provides for the council-manager form of government. 
    The policy-making and legislative powers are vested in the Town Council, consisting of the Mayor and six councilmembers elected at large for four-year overlapping terms. Councilmembers are elected on the basis of the largest number of votes received, while the election of the Mayor requires a majority of all the votes cast for that position. The Council may take action through ordinances, resolutions and motions. The Charter establishes procedures to promote the expeditious and efficient handling of Town matters as well as to encourage citizen participation. 
    The Town Manager is the chief executive and administrative officer of the Town. The Town Manager is appointed by, and serves at the pleasure of, the Town Council. 
Financial controls 
    The Charter imposes strict financial controls to insure responsible use of public funds, and provides for the conduct of the Town business on a balanced budget basis. 
Citizen rights 
    The protection of citizen rights is a major concern of this Charter. Provisions are established for the recall of elected officers, for control of legislation by the people through initiative and referendum, and for amendment of the Charter by popular vote. Also included are provisions requiring Town Council meetings to be open to the public and procedures for notice and publication of ordinances. 
    Continuing a well established Silverthorne tradition, citizen participation in the Town government is further promoted through service on commissions and boards. This includes a planning commission which provides recommendations for the orderly development, growth and beautification of the Town and adjacent areas, including the regular review and amendment of a comprehensive plan. 
Transitional provisions 
    For an orderly transition to home rule government, the Charter provides for the continuation in office of all present elected officials, appointed officers and employees, and for the continuation of existing legislation and obligations so long as they do not conflict with the Charter. 
    The Commission believes that this Charter provides a framework for sound and progressive municipal government which will maintain and enhance the quality of life of the citizens of Silverthorne, promote enlightened growth and development of the Town, and continue to be responsive to the needs and interests of the people.

PREAMBLE 
    Municipal home rule is based upon the theory that the citizens of a municipality should have the right to decide how their local problems should be solved. Still, the powers of home rule municipalities are limited by their charters, federal law, the state constitution, court decisions and legislation enacted by the General Assembly. It is the primary goal of this charter document to allow the government of the Town of Silverthorne to operate more efficiently and to be successful in solving problems. It will always be the objective of the government of the Town of Silverthorne to act in the best interests of the Town and its residents.

Section 1.2 - Powers 
    The Town shall have all the power of local self-government and home rule and all power possible for a municipality to have under the Constitution and laws of the State of Colorado. The enumeration of particular powers under this Charter is not exclusive of others. 
Section 1.3 - Rights and Liabilities

Section 2.9 - Special Election 
    Any special Town election may be called by resolution of the Council at least thirty days in advance of such election. The resolution calling a special Town election shall set forth the purpose or purposes of such election. 
Section 2.10 - Recall 
    Every elective officer may be recalled from office after holding office for at least six months. The procedure to effect the recall of any elective officer shall be as follows: 
a.  A petition shall be signed in accordance with Article XXI Section 4 of the Colorado Constitution. The petition shall contain a general statement of not more than two hundred words setting forth the specific factual reasons for the recall of the officer sought to be removed. The petition shall be filed with the Town Clerk. The only valid grounds for recall are willful misconduct or failure to perform duties. 
b.  When such petition is filed, the Town Clerk shall notify the Council and the Council shall by resolution call a recall election to be held within ninety days after the filing of the petition, if such petition is found to meet all the requirements of this Charter and the Colorado Constitution. 
c.  The ballot upon which the proposed recall is submitted shall be prepared by the Town Clerk and shall summarize and state the grounds set forth in the petition for demanding such recall and there shall also be printed thereon the words, "Shall [name of person against whom the recall petition is filed] be recalled from the office of [title of office]?" Following such question shall be the words "Yes" or "No" and a mechanism for indicating the vote for or against such recall. 
d.  In the event an officer is recalled by a majority vote of those voting on the question, the office shall be deemed vacant and shall be filled as provided in this Charter for the filling of such vacancies, except that the officer recalled shall not be appointed to fill the vacancy. 
e.  In the event an officer is not recalled after an election pursuant to this Section, no petition for the recall of the same officer for the same reason or reasons shall be accepted for filing by the Town Clerk for a period of six months from the date of the recall election. 
ARTICLE III - Town Council 

Section 3.1 - Elective Officers 
    The elective officers of the Town shall be a Mayor and six Councilmembers. Councilmembers and the Mayor shall be elected from the Town at large. 
Section 3.2 - Council Districts 
    The Council may provide by ordinance adopted at least ninety days prior to any regular Town election for the creation of two or more councilmember districts. Such districts shall be contiguous and compact wherever possible and shall have, as nearly as possible, substantially equal population. At least one councilmember shall be elected from each district by the voters of the entire Town. In the event such districts are created, the Council shall also amend precinct boundaries, if any, to conform to the district boundaries. If at any regular election a district could become unrepresented, then in that event the candidate from that district receiving the larger number of votes shall be elected to represent that district. All other vacancies which may occur at that election shall be filled by the candidates at large receiving the highest number of votes. Should councilmember districts be established pursuant to this Section, each Councilmember who is elected from a district shall also be a resident and registered elector of that district when nominated and elected or appointed. In the event a Councilmember moves out of the district from which he or she was elected, that office shall be deemed vacant and shall be filled as provided by Section 3.6. 
Section 3.3 - Qualifications of Elective Officers 
    Each elective officer when nominated and elected or appointed shall be a registered elector of the Town and shall have resided in the Town for one year immediately preceding such election or appointment. 
Section 3.4 - Powers of the Council 
    All powers of the Town not otherwise limited or conferred upon others by this Charter shall be vested in the Town Council. The Council shall have the power to enact and provide for the enforcement of all ordinances necessary to protect life, health, safety, welfare and property; to declare, prevent and summarily abate and remove nuisances; to preserve and enforce good government, general welfare, order and security of the Town and the inhabitants thereof; to enforce ordinances and regulations by ordaining fines, imprisonment, public service or any combination thereof; to provide for the granting of probation and the conditional suspension of sentences by the Municipal Court; and to delegate to staff, officials, boards and commissions within limitations of the Colorado Constitution and this Charter, such functions, powers and authority of the Town as it deems proper and advisable. No enumeration or particular powers granted to the Council shall be construed to impair any general grant of power herein contained or granted by the Colorado Constitution, nor to limit any such grant of power. 
Section 3.5 - Terms of Office 
    The Mayor and the six Trustees holding office at the time of adoption of this Charter shall remain in office until their current terms expire and their successors are elected as provided in this Section. Any elective officer of the Town may succeed himself or herself in office. 
a.  The term of office for Mayor, commencing with the election held in the year 1992, shall be for four years. Thereafter, election for the Mayor shall be held at the regular Town election every fourth year. 
b.  The three members of the current Board of Trustees elected in 1990 shall serve as Councilmembers until the regular Town election in 1994, at which time their tenure shall expire and their successors shall be elected, each for a four-year term of office. The three members of the current Board of Trustees elected in 1992 shall serve as Councilmembers until the regular Town election in 1996, at which time their terms shall expire and their successors shall be elected, each for a four-year term of office. 
c.  At the regular Town election in the year 1994 and every two years thereafter, three members of the Town Council of the Town of Silverthorne shall be elected for the following terms of office: 
1.  Those nominees seeking election for the Town Council who receive the first, second and third largest number of votes each shall be elected for a four-year term of office. 
2.  It is the intent of this Section that members of the Council serve four-year overlapping terms of office with three Councilmembers elected at each regular Town election. 
3.  In the event of a tie, there shall be a drawing by lot pursuant to the Colorado Municipal Election Code at the first regular meeting of the Town Council following the election. The winner of said lot drawing shall serve a four-year term. The loser shall be ranked immediately below the winner, for purposes of determining persons elected to the Council under Sections 3.5.c.1 and 3.6. 
Section 3.6 - Vacancies 
a.  An elected officer shall continue to hold office until his or her successor is duly qualified. An elective office shall become vacant whenever an elective officer fails or refuses to qualify, dies, resigns, is removed from office, is incapacitated to an extent which prohibits him or her from properly performing his or her duties as an elective officer, is absent continuously from the Town for more than three months without a leave of absence given by a vote of three-fourths of the entire Council in office at the time the vote is taken, is convicted by a court of law of any act constituting misconduct in office or constituting a felony, is judicially declared mentally ill, or moves from the Town of Silverthorne. 
b.  The existence of a vacancy shall be established by competent evidence thereof placed on record in the Council minutes. The Council shall determine the validity of the evidence and decide when a vacancy exists. 
c.  Not less than ten days nor more than thirty days after a vacancy in an elective office has been determined to exist by the Council, the remaining Councilmembers shall appoint an eligible person as defined by Sections 3.2 and 3.3, to fill such vacancy to serve until the next regular Town election. Such appointment shall be decided by a majority vote of the members of the Town Council in office at the time the vote is taken. If there will be remaining unexpired time in the term of office for which the appointment was made after the next regular election, then such vacancy for the remaining unexpired time shall be filled by vote of the registered electors at the next regular Town election. At the election, the candidates receiving the first, second and third highest number of votes shall serve terms of four years. The candidate receiving the fourth highest number of votes shall serve a term of two years, to serve the unexpired time in the office for which an appointment was made. Additional unexpired terms caused by additional vacancies, if any, shall be filled by candidates receiving the next highest number of votes. 
d.  In the event of a vacancy in the office of Mayor, the Council shall fill the vacancy by appointing one of the members of the Council to serve as Mayor until the next Town election. In the event there will be remaining unexpired time in the then current Mayor's term after the next Town election, candidates for the office of Mayor at that election shall run for a four-year term. In such event, the schedule for election of the Mayor by Section 3.5.a shall be superseded by this Section. 
Section 3.7 - Mayor 
    The Mayor shall be elected from the Town at large, and must receive a majority of the votes cast for all candidates for that office. In the event no candidate for Mayor receives a majority of the votes cast, a runoff election between the two candidates receiving the two highest number of votes shall be held within ninety days of the Town election. The candidate receiving a majority of votes at the runoff shall be elected Mayor. 
    The Mayor shall preside at meetings of the Council and shall exercise such powers and perform such other duties as are or may be conferred and imposed by this Charter or by ordinance or other applicable law. The Mayor shall have all the powers, rights and privileges of a Councilmember, excluding therefrom the right to vote. The Mayor shall vote only in the case of a tie. The Mayor shall not be counted as a member of the Council for purposes of achieving a quorum or for calculating the required number of votes to approve any given matter. The Mayor shall have the power to veto any action taken by vote of the Council, within two days of such action. A veto may be overridden by vote of three-fourths of the entire membership of the Council, only at the next regular or special meeting of the Council following the veto. The Mayor shall be recognized as the head of the Town Government for all ceremonial and legal purposes, shall execute and authenticate those legal instruments which require signature by the Mayor, and shall administer (or delegate the administration of) oaths of office. The Mayor (or in his or her absence, the Mayor Pro Tem) shall countersign all checks expending Town funds, except those items identified by ordinance not requiring such signature. In the event of a vacancy in the office of Mayor, the Council shall choose a successor to fill the unexpired term in the manner set forth at Section 3.6 hereof. 
Section 3.8 - Mayor Pro Tem 
    A Mayor Pro Tem shall be elected by the Council from its own membership at the first meeting following each regular Town election. The Mayor Pro Tem shall serve until the Council meeting following the next regular Town election, and shall act as Mayor during the absence or disability of the Mayor. In the event of absence or disability of both the Mayor and the Mayor Pro Tem, the Council shall designate another of its members to serve as Acting Mayor during such absence or disability. Any Mayor Pro Tem or Acting Mayor, while serving as such, shall retain all powers granted herein to Councilmembers, including the right to vote on all matters before the Council, but shall not have the power to veto Council actions. 
Section 3.9 - Conflict of Interest 
    Neither the Mayor nor any member of the Council shall vote or participate in discussion or deliberation on any question in which he or she has a substantial personal or financial interest, direct or indirect, including an interest held through a spouse or family member, other than the common public interest, or on any question concerning his or her own conduct. In the event the Mayor or any Councilmember has such an interest, he or she shall declare such interest. Whether or not such a declaration is made, the remaining members of the Council shall determine by a majority vote whether said interest does in fact constitute a conflict of interest. When such conflict of interest is established, the Mayor or Councilmember affected shall not participate further in the matter, and the remaining Councilmembers shall take any further action they deem to be in the best interests of the Town. This Section and any ordinance adopted in furtherance thereof shall abrogate and replace any common law doctrine on this subject. 
Section 3.10 - Oath of Office 
    Before entering upon the duties of his or her office, the Mayor and every Councilmember shall take, subscribe and file with the Town Clerk an oath or affirmation that he or she will support the Constitution of the United States of America, the Constitution of the State of Colorado, this Charter and the ordinances of the Town and will faithfully perform the duties of the office. 
Section 3.11 - Compensation of Councilmembers 
    The Mayor and members of the Council shall receive such compensation as the Council shall by ordinance prescribe; provided, however, no increase or decrease in the compensation of any member shall take effect during his or her then present term of office. No Councilmember shall be a salaried employee of the Town during his or her term of office, nor for one year following completion of his or her term of office. Neither the Mayor nor any Councilmember shall perform personal services for the Town during his or her term of office for which he or she is compensated other than as provided in this Section.
