PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Durango, Colorado, of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1962 Code, as supplemented through September 14, 1984, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1962 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-1 and the third section of Chapter 3 is 3-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-1 and 4-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-1.1, 4-1.2 and 4-1.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 6 and 7, it will be designated as Chapter 6.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor and Laura Johnson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Pauline Redman, City Clerk, and David Smith, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

After its adoption the ordinance shall be published in full. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it may specify. Every emergency ordinance shall automatically stand repealed as of the sixty-first day following the date on which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the ordinance in the manner specified in this section if the emergency still exists, or reenactment of the ordinance in accordance with the provisions set forth in section 13 of this article II.

For purposes of this section, "general revenues" shall be defined to include but not be limited to: ad valorem taxes, sales and use taxes, and charges of any nature to users or future users of the water or sewer systems. Other sources of revenue shall be considered "general revenues" if said revenues are not specifically discussed in other sections of this article.

(Charter Amend. of April, 1987) 
Sec. 21. - Limitation of indebtedness. 
    The aggregate amount of bonds or other forms of indebtedness payable in whole or in part from the proceeds of ad valorem taxes, or to which the full faith and credit of the city are pledged (excluding such debt relating to water and excluding securities issued under section 23) shall not exceed ten (10) percent of the assessed valuation of the taxable property within the city, as shown in the most recent assessment for city purposes. 
Sec. 22. - Revenue securities.

Sec. 23. - Local improvement bonds. 
    The city may, by ordinance of the city council, contract for or construct local or special improvements within specified districts of the city, and determine the methods of specially assessing the cost of such improvements, unless the owners of a majority of the property of such district oppose the project, or alternatively, if council so provides by procedural ordinance, a majority of the owners of property in an assessment unit oppose the project to be constructed in such unit. In connection with local improvement bonds payable from special assessments to be levied in such districts, the city may provide a special surplus and deficiency fund. Such fund shall be maintained to provide separate accounting for any surplus or deficiency after the bonds for a district are completely paid. Any surplus may be applied to any other local improvement bonds or may be returned to the general fund when no other improvement bonds are outstanding. In addition, the city council may provide for additional security by an annual tax levy on all taxable property of the city of no more than three (3) mills, or in lieu of such a tax levy may annually transfer to such special fund any available money of the city. The city may also pay out of such funds or the general fund the balance of any local improvement bonds that have been retired, to the extent of eighty (80) percent, in order for the remaining bonds to be retired as due. The city shall reimburse itself by collecting any unpaid assessments due in connection with a district. Local improvement bonds (as well as any other securities of the city) may be sold at public or private sale. 
Sec. 24. - Refunding securities. 
    The city may, by ordinance, issue securities for the purpose of refunding outstanding securities as the same mature or in advance of maturity (but without impairing then outstanding contractual rights) by means of escrow or otherwise; and it shall be the duty of council to authorize such refunding securities whenever it determines it to the best advantage of the city to do so. If the refunding securities are made payable in whole or in part from the proceeds of ad valorem taxes, or if they constitute a pledge of the full faith and credit of the city, the refunding securities shall not be issued unless they are first submitted to a vote in conformity with section 20, except that no such election shall be necessary as a condition precedent to the issuance of securities to refund general obligations originally issued with voter approval, water securities or local improvement securities. General obligation refunding securities (except water debt) shall be included in any debt limitation determination made pursuant to section 21, but the securities so refunded shall not be included in such determination. 
Sec. 25. - Long-term lease agreement. 
    The city council may, by ordinance, enter into long-term rental or leasehold agreements and may provide for payment thereof by general appropriation levy, by imposition of usage fees on such rental or leasehold property, or a combination of both general appropriation levy and imposition of usage fees. The obligation to pay such rental or leasehold costs shall not be construed to be a part of this Charter's limitation on indebtedness.

(a)  Legislative intent : It is the intent of the code of conduct and code of ethics (the codes) that officers, appointed board and commission members, employees, volunteers and independent contractors adhere to high levels of ethical conduct to assure that the public has confidence in the integrity of all aspects of city government and the city officials that exercise discretionary powers. These codes are intended to uphold the public trust in the persons in positions of public responsibility who are acting for the benefit of the public. Officers, city officials, employees, volunteers, and independent contractors shall comply with both the letter and the spirit of the ethics code and strive to avoid situations that create impropriety or the appearance of impropriety. The codes define and discourage certain actions that may create impropriety or the appearance of impropriety that undermine public trust in the accountability and loyalty of elected and appointed city officials, employees, volunteers and contractors. 
    The city shall be guided by the principle of non-partisanship: all actions, decisions and votes shall be made in the best interest of the public, on their merits, objectively and without regard to political party, or regional or ideological partisanship. 
(b)  Declaration of purpose: 
(1)  Framework: This code of conduct and code of ethics should evoke a commitment to maintain high ethical standards. The following substantive provisions form the framework of the essential principles governing the conduct and ethics of city officials, employees, independent contractors, and volunteers. 
a.  Public trust. Treat public service as a public trust, only using the power and resources of public service to advance public interest and not to attain personal or private benefit. 
b.  Objective judgment. Employ independent, objective judgment in performing duties, deciding all matters on the merits, free from avoidable conflicts of interest and both real and perceived improper influences. 
c.  Accountability. Assure that government is conducted openly, efficiently, equitably and honorably in a manner that permits the citizenry to make informed judgments and hold city officials accountable. 
d.  Democratic leadership. Honor and respect the principles and spirit of representative democracy and set a positive example of good citizenship by scrupulously observing the letter and spirit of laws, polices, and rules. 
e.  Respectability. Safeguard public confidence in the integrity of government by being honest, fair, and respectful, and by avoiding conduct that constitutes an impropriety or creates the appearance of impropriety or which otherwise benefits a city official, city employee, volunteer or contractor. 
(2)  Purpose of code of conduct and code of ethics: 
a.  Promote public confidence in the integrity of city officials; 
b.  State principles of conduct and ethics which are to be applied in public service; 
c.  Identify standards of ethical conduct for city officials and city employees; 
d.  Inform the public of the standards to which their city officials are expected to adhere; 
e.  Provide a process by which city officials and the public may identify and resolve conduct and ethical issues; and 
f.  Establish penalties, when appropriate, for city officials who violate the public trust.

Sec. 2-202. - General requirements. 
(a)  Duty. All city officials, public employees, and representatives of the city have a duty to use their public positions to contribute to the public good. This code of conduct and code of ethics shall not preclude city officials from acting in any manner consistent with their official duties or from providing assistance or public services to anyone who is entitled to them. All city officials, however, also have a fiduciary duty to refrain from using their positions in any manner for personal or private gain or which is detrimental to the public good. City officials must be mindful that the appearance of impropriety can be as corrosive of public confidence as an actual impropriety, and must strive to avoid situations which may create an appearance of impropriety.

(c)  Chronic violation of laws. City officials have an ethical duty to abide by federal, state, and city laws. Chronic or excessive violations of federal, state or city laws, even when they do not result in convictions for the commission of felonies, misdemeanors, or other laws whose violation constitutes a violation of this code of conduct and code of ethics, may indicate disrespect for the law and may contribute to the public's disrespect for city officials. 
(d)  State statutory requirements. All city officials shall comply with all applicable provisions of the Colorado Revised Statutes and Colorado Constitution regarding ethics, including Section 24-18-101, et seq., and Section 31-4-404, C.R.S., and Article XXIX of the Colorado Constitution notwithstanding the requirements of this code of conduct and code of ethics. The more stringent, applicable standards of conduct shall prevail in the event of any conflict among locally adopted standards and statutory requirements.

Sec. 2-203. - Code of conduct. 
    The city code of conduct represents a reasonable policy for guiding the conduct of city officials, and defining acceptable conduct in dealing with each other and individuals who are outside city government. The city council believes the code of conduct should be adhered to by all city officials to provide a productive, effective and respectful atmosphere. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the city manager to investigate the conduct of and discipline employees.

a.  Act within the boundaries of their authority as defined by the city Charter and Code; 
b.  Honor the chain of command; refrain from directing subordinate personnel; coordinate communication with staff through the city manager's office; direct correspondence with staff shall remain at the department head level and above;

(Ord. No. O-2014-39, § 1, 10-7-14; Ord. No. O-2017-9 , 1(Exh. A), 4-18-17) 
Sec. 2-204. - Code of ethics. 
    The city recognizes that ethical issues may arise in the course of public service. It is the intent of this code of ethics: 
(1)  To clarify the actions are allowed and those that constitute a breach of public trust, specifically relating to the use of public office for private gain, gifts, conflict of interest, improper use of confidential information or records, and other ethics matters not consistent with existing policies or the City Charter; 
(2)  To establish guidelines and principles to help city officials, employees, volunteers and independent contractors determine if their actions may cause an appearance of impropriety that would undermine the public's trust in local government; 
(3)  To establish a board of ethics empowered to issue advisory opinions so that city officials may seek guidance about ethical issues relevant to their service; 
(4)  To establish a system that allows citizens to report a possible wrongdoing and seek enforcement so that any breach of the public trust may be discovered and dealt with appropriately; 
(5)  To outline a process that provides equal protection for the complainant and the subject of the complaint; and 
(6)  To outline a process for penalizing officers and officials who violate the provisions of these codes. 
(Ord. No. O-2014-39, § 1, 10-7-14; Ord. No. O-2017-9 , 1(Exh. A), 4-18-17) 
Sec. 2-205. - Mandatory standards of ethical conduct. 
    The following requirements shall constitute the Durango code of ethics, establishing reasonable standards for the ethical conduct of city officials, city employees, and representatives of the city, volunteers and contractors. Failure to abide by these standards shall be deemed a violation of the code of ethics and shall subject the city official, city employee, or representative of the city to an investigation by the board of ethics and discipline by the city council (in issues involving city officials), and the city manager (in issues involving employees, independent contractors and volunteers). Violations may also constitute a violation of state law. It is a violation of the code of ethics for any city official, city employee, or representative of the city to: 
(1)  Confidential information. Disclose or use confidential information acquired in the course of official duties that is not generally available to the public to further the city official's personal financial interests, or disclose any confidential information, including any information obtained in an executive session, unless approved by majority vote of city council members in office, or waive any confidence or privilege of the city council or any board or commission without approval of the respective city council, board or commission. 
(2)  Disclosure. Fail to disclose any interest as defined in section 2-201 in a matter pending or being considered by the governing or advisory board prior to the vote. The city official shall give written notice to the city council or the board, commission, task force or similar body of which the city official is a member, and to the city manager and city attorney as soon as reasonably possible after the interest has arisen. However, no written notice is required if the city official discloses the conflict of interest on the record of a public meeting of the governing body or board or commission of which the city official is a member. 
(3)  Gifts of substantial value. Accept gifts of substantial value or of substantial economic benefit tantamount to a gift of substantial value of fifty dollars ($50.00) or more which would tend to improperly influence a reasonable person in a public position to depart from the faithful and impartial discharge of the city official's public duties, of which the city official knows, or which a reasonable person should know, is primarily for the purpose of rewarding an official action the city official has taken or could take. 
(4)  Engaging in financial transactions. Engage in a substantial financial transaction for the city official's private business purposes with a person the city official inspects or supervises in the course of the city official's official duties. 
(5)  Benefiting business interests. Perform an official action directly and substantially affecting, to its economic benefit, a business or other undertaking in which the city official either has an interest or is engaged as counsel, consultant, representative or agent. 
(6)  Interest. Vote on or attempt to influence the other members of the city council, a board or commission on which the city official sits regarding any proposed or pending matter in which the city official has an interest. A member of the city council or a board or commission may vote on such matter notwithstanding this prohibition if his or her participation is necessary to obtain a quorum and allow the city council, board or commission to vote and if he or she complies with the disclosure requirements of section 24-18-110, C.R.S. 
(7)  City officials shall not appear before the city council or any board or commission on which or over which the city official presides or has supervisory responsibilities, except in the city official's representation of the city. 
(8)  Crimes. Be convicted of or plead guilty to any felony or a misdemeanor (excluding traffic violations of six (6) points or less), whether or not the crime relates directly to the city official's position in public service. 
(9)  Discrimination. Violate any federal, state or city laws prohibiting discrimination. 
(10)  Harassment. Violate any federal, state or city laws concerning prohibited harassment. 
(11)  Retaliation. Be found guilty of violating or plead guilty to violating any federal, state or city laws prohibiting retaliation, including retaliation against whistleblowers or those filing claims against the city or those filing claims against a city official under the provisions of this policy. 
(12)  Outside employment or service. Engage in or accept any employment or service, other than employment by the city, if such employment or service reasonably would tend to impair the city official's independence of judgment in the performance of the city official's duties. This restriction is in addition to any other restrictions on outside employment applicable to a city official and is not intended to authorize outside employment by any city official if otherwise prohibited. 
(13)  Personal benefit. Use his or her own time or efforts or request or direct the use of another city official's time or efforts for personal or private purposes while such time is being compensated by the city or intended for general public benefit. 
(14)  Unauthorized use of name, position, or logo.

(Ord. No. O-2014-39, § 1, 10-7-14; Ord. No. O-2017-9 , 1(Exh. A), 4-18-17) 
Sec. 2-207. - Advisory opinions. 
(a)  Any current or former city official may submit a written request to the board of ethics for an advisory opinion on whether conduct by that person, as described in the request would constitute a violation of the code of ethics.

(Ord. No. O-2014-39, § 1, 10-7-14; Ord. No. O-2017-9 , 1(Exh. A), 4-18-17) 
Sec. 2-208. - Enforcement of the code of conduct and code of ethics. 
(a)  Complaints to the board of ethics. 
(1)  Any person, either personally or on behalf of an organization or governmental body, may file a complaint to the board of ethics with the city clerk. Within five (5) days of receiving a complaint the city clerk shall forward it to the board of ethics. In complaints involving employees, independent contractors and volunteers, the clerk shall forward the complaint to the city manager. 
(2)  A complaint must be in writing on a form approved by the board of ethics, be signed, and show the home address of the person who submitted it. The form shall contain a statement that must be signed and which states that, to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief the information in the complaint is true. The complaint must describe the facts that constitute the violation of the code of conduct or code of ethics in sufficient detail so that the board of ethics and the person who is the subject of the complaint can reasonably be expected to understand the nature of any violation that is being alleged. The board of ethics or its designee may request any additional information deemed necessary to screen the complaint or to render a decision. 
(3)  No complaints shall be accepted or considered which relate to actions that took place more than one (1) year prior to the date of filing. The individual filing the complaint has sixty (60) days from the date that the issue is brought to his or her attention to file a complaint. 
(4)  The board of ethics or its designee must notify the person who is the subject of the complaint that a complaint has been filed no more than five (5) days from the day the complaint was forwarded to the board of ethics from the city clerk. The notice shall include a copy of the full complaint; a copy of any portion of the code of conduct or code of ethics that is alleged to have been or that may be violated; and the board of ethics' rules of procedure. 
(5)  The board of ethics shall provide the subject of the complaint with a copy of the complaint via certified mail with return receipt before it provides copies to any other parties. Duplicate notification will also be sent via email with a receipt request to confirm receipt. The board of ethics recognizes that distribution to the public of a complaint prior to screening by the board of ethics as required below could harm a person's reputation and is contrary to the public interest; therefore, the public release of the complaint is prohibited until the screening process below has been completed. The subject of the complaint may submit a written response to the complaint to the board of ethics via the city clerk. Written responses will be accepted up to five (5) business days after the subject of the complaint receives the original notification either by certified mail or email. The board of ethics' meeting date for the initial screening process as specified in section 2-208 (6) shall be included in the letter sent to the subject of the complaint via certified mail with return receipt. The complainant will also be notified of the meeting date at that time. If the subject of the complaint neglects to respond within the five (5) business days as allotted herein, the board of ethics shall proceed with screening the complaint independent of receiving a written response. 
(6)  The board of ethics or a committee of the board of ethics shall consult in executive session to screen the complaint within fourteen (14) business days of receiving a complaint. If there is a public record of the event where the alleged misconduct occurred, such as a recording or written transcript, that information shall be included for the board of ethics' review as part of the initial screening process. The board may opt to continue the initial screening process beyond the allotted fourteen (14) days pending the receipt of the response from the subject of the complaint. In instances where the board feels the conflict may be resolved informally, the board may recommend the parties pursue an alternate process for informally resolving the conflict. As part of this process, at the board's discretion, the board may request that the parties participate in the executive session. After the initial screening process the board of ethics may: 
a.  Immediately dismiss the complaint as described in section 2-208(a)(7); 
b.  Recommend the parties participate in mediation as outlined in section 2-208(a)(8); 
c.  Set the complaint for a hearing as outlined in section 2-208(a)(10); or 
d.  Conduct an investigation as outlined in section 2-208(a)(9). 
(7)  The board of ethics may immediately dismiss the complaint if: 
1.  It has no jurisdiction; or 
2.  The alleged violation, if true, would not constitute a violation of the code of ethics or code of conduct; or 
3.  The alleged violation is a minor or de minimis violation; or 
4.  The complaint is, on its face, frivolous, groundless, or brought for purposes of harassment; or 
5.  The matter has become moot because the person who is the subject of the complaint is no longer an officer, official or employee; or 
6.  The person who is the subject of the complaint had obtained an advisory opinion under section 2-207 permitting the conduct; or 
7.  The appointing authority of the person who is the subject of the complaint has already taken action as a result of finding a violation and the board of ethics believes the action taken was appropriate. 
In issues regarding code of conduct and code of ethics violations, the enforcement process is intended to be corrective and collaborative rather than remedial unless the violation is a repeated offense. In the event the board of ethics determines a code of conduct or code of ethics violation has occurred, and it is minor in nature, or that it can best be resolved informally, then with the concurrence of the complainant and the subject of the complaint, the board of ethics may suspend the hearing process and conduct a more informal mediation process or an investigation process in lieu of a hearing. 
(8)  Mediation process. 
a.  If the board of ethics recommends that the parties participate in a mediation, the mediation shall be conducted by a mutually agreed upon third party mediator, who is approved by the board of ethics. The cost of the mediation will be divided between the parties, unless otherwise agreed to by both parties. The city and the board of ethics shall provide a list of approved mediators to assist with the selection process. If the parties cannot agree on a mediator, and the terms of payment for the mediator, then the board of ethics shall appoint a mediator and determine the terms of payment. 
b.  The board of ethics shall review the mediation recommendations, solutions and proposed resolution. If the mediation result sufficiently addresses the original complaint, the party filing the complaint will submit in writing a formal request to the board of ethics, via the city clerk, requesting the board of ethics suspend any further action regarding the complaint. The board of ethics may then dismiss the complaint. 
(9)  Investigation process. If the complaint is not dismissed or resolved pursuant section 2-208(a)(6)(7) or (8), the board of ethics may direct a staff member or appoint an individual to investigate the complaint in order to determine if a hearing is warranted. The investigation typically should not exceed thirty (30) days. The investigation may include obtaining further detail or clarification from the complainant or obtaining additional information from the person who is the subject of the complaint, that person's supervisor if any, public records, or other reasonable and readily available sources. As part of the investigation, the investigator shall submit a written report outlining the facts as determined by the investigation. 
The board of ethics shall review the additional information and determine whether the investigation is complete or whether additional information is needed. The board of ethics shall have the completed, reviewed report sent to both parties via certified mail with return receipt. Each party will have five (5) days to respond to the report in writing prior to the board of ethics finalizing its decision. Once the board of ethics finds that the investigation is complete, the board of ethics shall dismiss the complaint; request written arguments, weigh the arguments and make a finding; or proceed under paragraph (10) below. If information received is confidential or privileged, the board of ethics shall maintain the confidentiality or privilege. 
(10)  Hearing process. If the complaint is not dismissed or adequately resolved in a manner that is acceptable to the board of ethics, or otherwise resolved pursuant to section 2-208(a)(6),(7),(8) or (9), the board of ethics shall issue a notice of hearing, which shall set forth in reasonable detail the alleged violations of the code of ethics or code of conduct and the facts supporting the allegations. The notice of hearing shall be mailed to the person filing the complaint and to the subject of the complaint within ten (10) days of its adoption. The notice shall inform the parties that they may consult with or be represented by an attorney or other representative of their own choosing. The notice shall require a response to the notice of hearing to be filed by the subject of the complaint within twenty (20) days, unless an extension is granted for good cause. When received by the board of ethics, the response shall be mailed promptly to the complainant. 
(11)  Within fourteen (14) days of the receipt of the response, the board of ethics shall issue to the parties a notice to set a date and place for the hearing, which shall be open to the public. The board of ethics will attempt to accommodate the parties in selecting a date that is mutually agreeable. If no response is received, the hearing shall proceed nonetheless. 
(12)  Any time after the issuance of the notice of hearing, the board of ethics, at its discretion, may make a finding solely on the basis of written arguments without holding a public hearing if it determines that there is no significant discrepancy in the facts. However, the subject of the complaint shall have the right to request a hearing, which shall be open to the public. 
(13)  At any time after the issuance of the notice of hearing, the board of ethics may dismiss a complaint without a finding for or against the subject of the complaint if it finds that the person committed the violation due to oversight and the person comes into voluntary compliance. 
(14)  After the complaint has been filed, none of the parties or their representatives may communicate on an ex parte basis with the hearing officer or any board of ethics member on any manner pertaining to the complaint. All communications pertaining to the complaint shall be sent to the board of ethics via the appointed staff member. 
(15)  Hearing procedures: 
a.  It is the intent of the city and the board of ethics to set forth these hearing procedures to assure that the hearing process is timely, fair and is conducted in a manner that affords due process to all parties. 
b.  A quorum of the board of ethics shall act as the hearing panel under the procedures set forth in this section. All decisions of the board of ethics shall be made by a majority vote of the quorum of the board of ethics. 
c.  The board of ethics shall appoint one (1) of its members or a third party to preside over the hearing as the hearing officer prior to setting the matter for a hearing.

f.  No person shall be compelled to testify about or divulge any information that is protected by a privilege under Colorado law. 
g.  The hearing officer may call a pre-hearing conference or issue pre-hearing instructions in order to refine the issues, determine the positions of the parties, make preliminary rulings on evidentiary issues or to take other actions to assure fairness and to expedite the hearing. 
h.  There shall be no formal discovery. However, no less than fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing, the parties shall provide the other parties and the hearing officer, through the board of ethics staff liaison, with a copy of the following: 
1.  A list of all witnesses the party may call at the hearing, together with a brief summary of the substance of each witness' testimony; 
2.  A copy of all documents or other evidence to be introduced at the hearing;

Any violation of this provision shall be reported to the hearing officer and the board of ethics for review and possible action, which may include the required recusal of a member of the board of ethics from the process.

5.  The parties shall be allowed to present evidence in rebuttal of any evidence presented by the other party;

l.  The hearing officer may continue the hearing if it is deemed to be necessary to assure fairness to a party to the proceeding. 
m.  Parties may represent themselves at the hearing, or they may be represented by an attorney at his or her own expense, or by any person of their choice other than a city official.

(b)  Proceedings shall be initiated through the issuance of a notice and order which shall be directed to the record owner of the building or structure. The notice and order shall contain: 
(1)  The street address and a legal description of the property sufficient to identify the premises upon which the building or structure is located;

(c)  The notice and order, and any amended or supplemental notices and orders shall be served upon the record owner(s) and shall be posted upon the property. Service of such notice and order shall be made either by personal service or by mailing a copy thereof by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the record owner(s) at the address set forth in the records of the La Plata County Assessor's office. Service shall be effective as of the date of personal service upon the record owner(s) of the property, or, in the case of certified mail, upon the date of actual delivery, refusal of delivery, or failure to respond to the third notice of attempted delivery, whichever shall first occur. Proof of service shall be certified to by the person making such service through a written declaration declaring the time, date and manner or method by which service was made. Such declaration shall be filed with the director of the department of planning and community development.

Sec. 6-133. - Appeal of notice and order. 
(a)  Any person served with a notice and order pursuant to section 6-132 of this article may appeal such notice and order, or any amended or supplemental notices and orders, by filing a written appeal with the director of the department of planning and community development. 
(b)  The appeal shall be filed no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the service of such notice and order as defined in section 6-132(c); provided, however, if the building or structure is in such condition as to make it immediately dangerous to public safety or adjacent property and is ordered vacated, and the notice and order provides notice of such facts, such appeal shall be filed within five (5) business days from the date of the service of the notice and order. 
(c)  Any such appeal shall be referred to and heard by the building and fire code board of appeals, in conformance with the provisions of section 12-2 of Chapter 27 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Durango. Any determination by the building and fire code board of appeals with respect to a notice and order which has been appealed by the property owner shall constitute final administrative action under this article. 
(Ord. No. 2000-5, § 1, 3-21-00) 
Sec. 6-134. - Compliance. 
    After any order made pursuant to this article becomes final, whether by lapse of time after the service of a notice and order or through a determination by the building and fire code board of appeals, no person to whom such notice and order has been directed shall fail, neglect or refuse to obey such order. Any person who fails to comply with such final order shall be guilty of a violation of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Durango and the city manager, or his designated agent, shall thereafter cause a citation or complaint to be filed in the Durango Municipal Court and a summons to be issued and served upon the record owner of the building or structure which is the subject of such final order. An owner of a building or structure with respect to which a notice and order has been issued shall not be considered to have failed, neglected or refused to obey such order in circumstances where the remedial work cannot be reasonably completed within the time frame set forth in the notice and order issued pursuant to section 6-132(b), if such remedial work is either initiated within the designated timeframe and thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or if an extension of time for completion is granted by the city manager and the remedial work is completed within the extended time period allowed. 
(Ord. No. 2000-5, § 1, 3-21-00) 
Sec. 6-135. - Abatement by city; recovery of costs. 
(a)  Once a notice and order have become final, through a determination on appeal or otherwise, if the owner of the property upon which an unsafe building or structure is located fails to take the necessary remedial action to repair, rehabilitate, demolish or remove the building or structure, or in those instances where the record owner of the subject property cannot be found after the exercise of due diligence, the city shall be authorized to take such action as it deems appropriate to cure or remedy the condition(s) associated with the unsafe building or structure that has been determined to be dangerous to the health, safety and welfare of the public. The actual costs of such remedial action by the city shall be billed to the property owner, either as a lump sum or in installments, as may be determined by the city council. The billing notice shall be mailed to the property owner, by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the address set forth in the records of the La Plata County Assessor's office and shall be deemed to have been delivered upon the date of actual delivery, the date of refusal of delivery, or the date of the third notice of attempted delivery, whichever shall first occur. If such billing is not paid within a period of sixty (60) days from the date of delivery such billing notice, or in the case of installment payments, if a payment is more than sixty (60) days delinquent, the city manager or his designated agent shall cause a lien to be placed against the subject property for the costs of such remedial action, together with interest thereon at the rate of twelve (12) percent per annum. Such lien shall be subject to enforcement and foreclosure by the city in the same manner as the foreclosure of a mechanic's lien in the State of Colorado, through the initiation of an action against the property owner in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(b)  If a property owner believes that the costs of remedial action billed by the city are either inaccurate or excessive, the property owner may appeal the determination of such costs to the building and fire code board of appeals. Such appeal shall be filed with the director of the department of planning and community development no later than thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of the billing notice. If an appeal is timely filed, no action to collect the billing for remedial work, inclusive of the placement of a lien on the property, shall be initiated until such time as the appeal has been concluded and a final determination made by the building and fire code board of appeals. 
(Ord. No. 2000-5, § 1, 3-21-00) 
Sec. 6-136. - Liability of owner. 
    Liability for the failure to remedy or correct a condition associated with a building or structure that has been determined to be unsafe under the provisions of this article shall rest solely upon the record owner of the property. It shall not constitute a defense to any prosecution or notification of required action under this article that parties other than the record owner occupy the subject building or structure, or that the owner has engaged the services of an agent for purposes of management of said property.

Homeowners may vote either directly or through a written ballot signed by the homeowner. Such consent must be obtained within sixty (60) days after such notice is provided, otherwise the homeowners shall be deemed to have declined to provide their informed consent to such action.

If a container is available for servicing on the first service day of the month, the monthly fee for that container will be assessed. If a container is not available for servicing on the first service day of the month, the monthly fee for that container will not be assessed. 
(e)  When a customer requests a discontinuation of city water and sewer services for a specific location trash collection and recycling services will also be discontinued and no minimum residential user charge will be assessed until such time that city water and sewer services are again reinstated, at which time trash collection and recycling services will also be reinstated and minimum residential user charges will again apply.

If the appeal is denied or partially denied, any sums due pursuant to the citation previously issued, as modified by the hearing officer decision, shall be payable to the city within thirty (30) days subsequent to the date of the hearing officer's decision. 
(f)  A fine assessed by means of a citation may be collected by any means allowed by law. Enforcement actions are intended to be cumulative in nature. The city may pursue any and all lawful remedies, separately or concurrently, to effect compliance with an issued citation. The granting of a right of appeal pursuant to this section shall not interfere with or otherwise compromise the city's right to prosecute violations as a criminal offense.

DIVISION 1. - RETAIL MARIJUANA ESTABLISHMENTS[8] 

Footnotes: 
--- (8) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O-2014-32, §§ 1, 2, adopted Aug. 5, 2014, repealed the former Art. VIII, Div. 1, §§ 13-160-13-178, and enacted a new Art. VIII, Div. 1, as set out herein. The former Art. VIII, Div. 1, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. O-2014-26, § 1, adopted June 16, 2014. 

Sec. 13-160. - Legislative intent and purpose. 
(a)  Legislative intent. The city council intends to regulate the use, acquisition, production and distribution of recreational marijuana in a manner consistent with Article XVIII, Section 16 of the Colorado Constitution (the "Recreational Marijuana Amendment", also known as Amendment 64) and in accordance with the Colorado Retail Marijuana Code and Regulations adopted by the State of Colorado thereunder. 
(1)  House Bill 13-1317, signed by the governor on May 28, 2013, enacts C.R.S. Tile 12 Article 43.4 (the "Colorado Retail Marijuana Code"), which imposes statewide regulations pertaining to the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and sale of retail marijuana and the licensing of retail marijuana establishments. This legislation provides for local licensing, however, the state law is not intended to, and does not, address the local impacts of marijuana operations, making it appropriate for local regulations of marijuana operations. 
(2)  Use, distribution, cultivation, production, possession and transportation of marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and marijuana is still classified as a "Level 1 Controlled Substance" under federal law. Nothing within this article is intended to promote or condone the production, use, sale or distribution of retail or recreational marijuana other than in compliance with applicable local and state law. 
(3)  This article is not intended to regulate medical marijuana businesses which are governed by the medical marijuana licensing provisions contained in division 2 of this article VIII. 
(4)  This article is to be construed to protect the interests of the public over marijuana business interests. Operation of a retail marijuana establishment is a revocable privilege and not a right within the city. There is no property right for an individual to have or a business to sell marijuana within the city. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this division 1 is to implement the recreational marijuana amendment in a manner consistent with C.R.S. Title 12, Article 43.4, to protect the health safety and welfare of the residents of the city by prescribing the time, place and manner in which retail marijuana establishments may be operated within the city. Further the purpose of this article VIII is to: 
(1)  Provide for the safe sale of retail and recreational marijuana to persons legally permitted to obtain, possess and use marijuana for recreational purposes in accordance with the recreational marijuana amendment. 
(2)  Protect public health and safety through reasonable limitations on business operations as they relate to noise, air and water quality, food safety, neighborhood and public safety, security for the business and its personnel, and other health and safety concerns. 
(3)  Impose fees in an amount sufficient to cover the direct and indirect costs to the city of licensing and regulating retail marijuana establishments. 
(4)  Adopt a mechanism for monitoring compliance with the provisions of this division 1. 
(5)  Create regulations that address the particular needs of residents and businesses of the city and coordinate with laws enacted by the state that pertain to this issue. 
(6)  Allow retail marijuana stores and retail marijuana testing facilities in the city on the condition that such establishments are operated in compliance with this division 1, rather than banning retail marijuana establishments in the city as permitted by the recreational marijuana amendment. 
(7)  Facilitate the implementation of the recreational marijuana amendment without going beyond the authority granted by such amendment.

All retail marijuana establishment licenses shall be issued for a specific fixed location within an enclosed building. The portion of such premises upon which the submitted floor plan shows that retail marijuana may be produced, dispensed or possessed shall be considered the "restricted area" portion of the business premises. 
(b)  A retail marijuana store may be allowed and licensed for operation in the central business district (CBD), mixed-use arterial (MU-A), commercial general (CG), commercial regional (CR), business park (BP), and limited industrial (LI) zones through a limited use permit (LUP). A marijuana testing facility may be allowed and licensed for operation in the mixed-use arterial (MU-A), commercial general (CG), commercial regional (CR), business park (BP), and limited industrial (LI) zones through a limited use permit (LUP). Both retail marijuana stores and marijuana testing facilities may be allowed in planned development (PD) zones pursuant to the PD approval process. 
(c)  Within all zones, no new retail marijuana store shall be located within two-hundred and fifty (250) feet of a parcel on which is located any other medical marijuana center or retail marijuana store. The two-hundred and fifty (250) foot buffer shall be measured from the boundaries of the legally described parcel on which a marijuana business is located to any point of the proposed parcel for a new marijuana business. If the two-hundred and fifty (250) foot buffer touches any part of a parcel, that entire parcel is not allowed to contain a marijuana business. Condominium properties shall be measured from the original legal parcel of the condo project, which will include the perimeter of all the condo units and any common areas. 
In the central business district (CBD), not more than one (1) medical marijuana center or retail marijuana store shall be located on a block. A block is established by a legal recorded plat or is an area bounded by four (4) city streets.

For corner lots, this standard applies to both street segments that abut the corner lot, and only one (1) medical marijuana center or retail marijuana store is permitted on the corner lots that abut the intersection. 
Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the co-location of a medical marijuana center and retail marijuana store in the same licensed location.

(f)  The separation requirements in subsection 13-168(d) shall not apply to any existing location that is licensed as a medical marijuana center on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derived if that location is licensed or is the subject of an application for a license for a retail marijuana store as a conversion from a licensed medical marijuana center or as a co-located retail marijuana store with a licensed medical marijuana center prior to January 2, 2015. Provided, however, that such converted license or co-located license shall otherwise be in compliance with all other requirements of this article, the Codes of the City of Durango and state law. 
(g)  No retail marijuana establishment license shall be issued for a location that has within two (2) years immediately preceding the date of the application, been denied by the Durango Local Licensing Authority or the state licensing authority for a retail marijuana establishment or medical marijuana business due to a concern related to the location. 
(h)  The measuring of distances for separations required in this division 1 shall be completed by the city utilizing official maps and shall be determined by measuring from the closest point on the perimeter of the applicant's property to the closet point of the property of any facility or use requiring a separation pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. A retail marijuana establishment license may not be issued for any location which is also part of the licensed premises of a business holding an alcoholic beverage license pursuant to chapter 3 of this Code. 
(i)  An applicant may make a request to the Durango Local Licensing Authority to grant a variance of up to ten (10) percent from the distance required in subsection (e) of this section for the separation between retail marijuana establishments and public parks which contain playground equipment and the Durango Local Licensing Authority may grant such a variance if it finds that the location of the retail marijuana establishment is separated from the public park by a natural or manmade feature or barrier that tends to physically and visually separate the retail marijuana establishment from the public park or from children using the park. 
(j)  It shall be unlawful for the owner of a building to lease space to or allow the use of any portion of the building by a retail marijuana establishment unless the tenant has a valid retail marijuana establishment license or has applied for and not been denied a retail marijuana establishment license. No marijuana shall be allowed on the leased premises until a retail marijuana establishment license has been issued by the city. In the event that the city has an articulable reason to believe that a retail marijuana establishment is being operated within a building, it shall be unlawful for the owner of the building to refuse to allow the city access to the portion of the building in which the suspected retail marijuana establishment is located to determine whether any marijuana is on the premises. 
(k)  It shall be unlawful for any licensee or other person to engage in any manufacturing or production of any retail marijuana infused products or to engage in any cultivation or other marijuana growing operations on the licensed premises of any retail marijuana establishment.

(b)  A person who holds both a medical marijuana center license pursuant to Division 2 and Article 43.3 of Title 12, C.R.S. and a retail marijuana store license and a person who holds both a retail marijuana testing facility license and a medical marijuana testing facility license may operate both licenses within the same premises ("co-located operation"), provided they can satisfy the requirements applicable to each business or each premises under the Colorado Retail Marijuana Code, the Colorado Medical Marijuana Code and this article VIII and other City Codes and State law. 
(c)  No co-located license shall be issued for a retail marijuana store and a retail or medical marijuana testing facility, or for a medical marijuana business and a retail or medical marijuana testing facility. 
A person who has an interest in a retail or medical marijuana testing facility license from the state licensing authority for testing purposes shall not have any interest in a licensed medical marijuana center, a licensed optional premises cultivation operation, a licensed medical marijuana-infused products manufacturer, a licensed retail store, a licensed retail marijuana cultivation facility, or a licensed retail marijuana products manufacturer. A person that has an interest in a licensed medical marijuana center, a licensed optional premises cultivation operation, a licensed medical marijuana-infused products manufacturer, a licensed retail marijuana store, a licensed retail marijuana cultivation facility, or a licensed retail marijuana products manufacturer shall not have an interest in a facility that has a medical marijuana testing facility license. 
(d)  No co-located license shall be issued for a location in any zone where either of the proposed co-located operations are prohibited by subsection 13-168(b) of this division 1. 
(e)  In the event a medical marijuana center authorizes medical patients under twenty-one (21) years of age on the premises, then there shall be a complete separation of the medical marijuana business and the retail marijuana store operated under a co-located license. Specifically, the operation of the co-located business premises shall include the following: 
(1)  Separate sales and storage areas. 
(2)  Separate entrances and exits. 
(3)  Separate inventories and inventory tracking processes. 
(4)  Separate point of sales operations.

(f)  Licensees operating a medical marijuana center that prohibits the admittance of patients under the age of twenty-one (21) years and a retail marijuana store may share their licensed premises as a co-location. Such a medical marijuana center licensee must post signage that clearly conveys that persons under the age of twenty-one (21) years may not enter. Under these circumstances, and upon approval of the state licensing authority and the city, the medical marijuana and retail marijuana and medical marijuana-infused product and retail marijuana product must be separately displayed on the same sale floor. Record-keeping for the business operations of both must enable the state and the city to clearly distinguish the inventories and business transactions of medical marijuana and medical marijuana-infused products from retail marijuana and retail marijuana product.

After the hearing has been concluded, after all written complaints, remonstrances and objections have been read and duly considered, and after all persons desiring to be heard in person have been heard, the council shall consider the arguments, if any, and any other relevant material put forth. Thereafter, if the council shall determine that it is not for the public interest that the proposed project, or a part thereof, be made, the council shall make an order by resolution to that effect and thereupon the proceeding for the project, or the part thereof, determined against by such order, shall stop and shall not be begun again until the adoption of a new resolution.

(c)  All proceedings may be modified or rescinded wholly or in part by resolution adopted by the council at any time prior to the passage of the ordinance adopted pursuant to section 14-54(b) and authorizing the project. No substantial change in the district, details, preliminary plans or specifications or estimates shall be made after the first publication or mailing of notice to property owners, whichever occurs first, except for the deletion of a portion of a project and property from the proposed program and district or assessment unit. The city engineer, however, shall have the right to make minor changes in time, plans and materials entering into the work at any time before its completion. 
(d)  Any objection to the regularity, validity and correctness of the proceedings and instruments taken, adopted or made prior to the date of the hearing shall be deemed waived unless presented by written remonstrance at the time and in the manner specified in this article. 
(Code 1962, § 9-10-6) 
Sec. 14-54. - Presentation of estimate, plans, maps. 
(a)  After the hearing for the property owners to present their views in respect to proposed public improvements, as provided for in this article, after the city council has disposed of all remonstrances, if any, so filed, and after the council has determined to proceed with the local improvement district, as modified, if modified, the council, if there be modification, by resolution shall direct the city engineer to prepare and present to the council: 
(1)  A revised and detailed estimate of the total cost, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the cost of constructing and otherwise acquiring each proposed improvement and of each of the incidental costs, which revised estimate shall not constitute a limitation for any purpose except as provided in subsection (b); 
(2)  Full and detailed plans and specifications for each proposed improvement designed to permit and encourage competition among the bidders, if any improvement is to be acquired by contract; 
(3)  A revised map showing the location of each improvement and the real property to be assessed therefor. The resolution may combine or divide the proposed improvement into suitable construction units for the purpose of letting separate and independent contracts, regardless of the extent of any improvement constituting an assessment unit and regardless of whether a portion or none of the cost of any improvement is to be defrayed other than by the levy of special assessments. Nothing, however, contained in this section shall be construed as not requiring the segregation of costs for assessment purposes as provided in this article. 
(b)  When an accurate estimate of cost, full and detailed plans and specifications, and maps are prepared, are presented and are satisfactory to the council, it shall adopt an ordinance prescribing: 
(1)  The extent of the local improvement district to be assessed and of each assessment unit, if any, by boundaries or other brief description; 
(2)  The kind and location of each improvement proposed, without mentioning minor details; 
(3)  The amount or proportion of the total cost to be defrayed by special assessments, the method of levying assessments, the number of installments and the times in which the costs assessed will be payable; 
(4)  The character and extent of any construction units. The engineer may further revise such cost, plans and specifications and map from time to time for all or any part of any project and the ordinance may be appropriately amended prior to letting any construction contract therefor and prior to any work being done other than by independent contract let by the city. The ordinance, as amended, if amended, shall order the work to be done as hereinafter in this article. No contract shall be let for any improvement nor an improvement ordered acquired under the direction of the finance director/treasurer or otherwise for any amount exceeding the revised estimated cost of the project excluding incidental costs. 
(Code 1962, § 9-10-7) 
Sec. 14-55. - Independent contracts; bids. 
(a)  Any improvement of any nature made in any district where the entire cost, value or amount of such work including labor and materials shall exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), except such work done by employees of the city with supplies and materials purchased by it as provided in this article, or except by labor or supplies and materials, or all of such, supplied under agreement with the United States, the state or any federal or state agency, instrumentality or corporation or other political subdivision, shall be done only under independent contract to be entered into by the city with the lowest responsible bidder submitting the lowest and best bid upon proper terms after due public notice has been given asking for competitive bids. The notice shall state that bids will be received at a time and place designated therein and shall be published at least once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks by two (2) weekly insertions in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, the first publication to be not less than fifteen (15) nor more than thirty (30) days prior to the time specified in the notice for opening bids. The city shall have the right to reject any and all bids and to waive any irregularity in any bid. Any contract may be let on a lump sum or unit basis. No contract shall be entered into for such work unless the contractor shall give an undertaking with a sufficient surety approved by the city council and in an amount fixed by the council for the faithful performance of the contract except as otherwise provided in this article. Upon default in the performance of the contract, the proper official may advertise and relet the remainder of the work without further ordinance and deduct the cost from the original contract price and recover any excess cost by suit on the original bond, or otherwise. All contracts shall provide, among other things, that the person entering into the contract with the city will pay for all materials furnished and services rendered for the performance of the contract, and that any person furnishing the materials or rendering the services may maintain an action to recover for the same against the obligor in the undertaking as though the person was named therein; provided, that the action is brought within one (1) year after the time of the cause of action accrued. Final settlement shall be effected substantially as required by all laws thereunto enabling. The city shall have the power to make any improvement, or portion thereof, in any district, directly by the officers, agents and employees of the city, with supplies and materials purchased or otherwise acquired therefor. 
(b)  All supplies and materials purchased by the city for any district (but not by a contractor) costing five hundred dollars ($500.00) or more shall be purchased only after due advertisement as provided in subsection (a). The city shall accept the lowest bid, kind, quality and material being equal, but the city shall have the right to reject any and all bids, to waive any irregularity in any bid, and to select a single item from any bid. The provision as to bidding shall not apply to the purchase of patented and manufactured products offered for sale in a noncompetitive market or solely by a manufacturer's authorized dealer. 
(c)  No city commissioner, other elected official, or appointed officer, agent or employee of the city (except in such official capacity) shall either directly or indirectly be a party to, or be in any manner interested in, any contract or agreement with the city for any matter, cause, or thing whatsoever by reason whereof any liability, indebtedness or obligation shall in any way be created against the city for any district, except it be by competitive bidding. If any contract or agreement shall be made in violation of the provisions of this subsection it shall be voidable, and no action shall be maintained thereon by any party thereto against the city. To the extent the city makes any payment thereunder, such contract or agreement shall be valid, and any such payment may be included in any cost defrayed by the levy of special assessments, unless theretofore the city elects to void the contract or agreement in its entirety and to recover any such payment from the party to whom made. 
(d)  Subject to the aforesaid but without intending by this provision to limit any powers of the city, it may enter into and carry out any contract or establish or comply with the rules and regulations concerning labor and materials and other related matters in connection with any project, or portion thereof, as the city may deem desirable or as may be requested by the United States, the state, or any federal or state agency, instrumentality or corporation or other political subdivision that may assist in the financing of any project or any part thereof. Any improvement, any portion of the cost of which may be defrayed by the city by the levy of special assessments hereunder, may be acquired with the cooperation and assistance of, or under a contract let by, or with labor, or supplies and materials, or all of such furnished by, the United States, the state, or any federal or state agency, instrumentality or corporation, or other political subdivision. Advantage may be taken of any offer from any source to complete any improvement on a division of expense or responsibility. The engineer on behalf of and in the name of the city is authorized to make any such improvement in such a manner, when so authorized by an ordinance adopted pursuant to section 14-54. 
(e)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to any case in which the city has taken over by transfer or assignment any contract authorized to be assigned to it under the provisions of this article nor to any contract in connection with the construction or improvement of any project which the city may have had transferred to it by any person or private corporation. 
(Code 1962, § 9-10-8) 
Sec. 14-56. - Alternate procedure with consent of all owners. 
    Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, the council may provide for the acquisition or construction of any local improvements and may adopt an ordinance creating a district for such purpose or an ordinance to levy assessments within such district without complying with the notice and hearing provisions of this chapter if the city has entered into an agreement with the owners of all of the assessable property within the district which states that the owners (a) waive all requirements of this chapter for notice or hearing and (b) agree to be included in the district and to be assessed for the costs of the improvements. The agreement must include a description of the local improvements, a legal description of the property to be included in the district, a description of the method of assessment and the maximum amount which may be assessed against each property and must be recorded in the real estate records maintained by the county clerk. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if such an agreement is entered into between the city and the owners of all of the assessable property, it is not required that the city comply with section 14-36, section 14-51, section 14-52, section 14-53. Subsection 14-54(a), subsection 14-121(c), subsections 14-122(a)-(d), or the publication requirements of section 14-128. The council may provide for a reserve fund, letter of credit, surety bond or other collateral for payment of any bonds issued for the district and include all or any portion of the costs thereof in the amounts assessed against the property in the district and in the amount of bonds issued for the district. The council may provide for the disposition of interest earned on the reserve fund and other bond proceeds, for the disposition of unexpended bond proceeds after completion of the project and for the disposition of the unexpended balance in the reserve fund after payment in full of the bonds for the district.

Any person concerned who objects to the regularity, validity and correctness of proceedings and instruments taken, adopted or made at or subsequent to such hearing and prior to the final passage of the ordinance shall also have the right so to commence such an action or suit to cure or set aside such purported irregularity, invalidity or incorrectness. Nothing in this section shall be construed as not requiring any person to make any objection by written remonstrance at such hearing in order not to waive such objection, if the purported irregularity, invalidity or incorrectness of any matter first occurred prior to the first publication of the notice of the hearing. After the expiration of such fifteen (15) days all action or suits not so commenced attacking the regularity, validity and correctness of that ordinance and of all proceedings, determinations and instruments taken, adopted or made prior to such ordinance's final passage, shall be perpetually barred. 
(Code 1962, § 9-10-12) 
Sec. 14-75. - Assessment determined by benefit.

Such special assessments shall be in proportion to the special benefits derived to such property and on a front foot, area, zone, or other equitable basis, as may be determined by the council, sufficient to cover the portion of the total cost of the improvement to be defrayed by special assessments. Regardless of the basis so determined, in cases of wedge or V in any irregular shaped lots or tracts, the amount apportioned thereto shall be in proportion to the special benefits thereby derived.

And in the meaning of this section, a street or railway company shall be held to occupy and shall be liable for the grading and paving of that part of the street lying between the rails of each tract and two (2) feet outside of each rail; and every railway company, whether street railway or otherwise, shall be assessed for the cost of the paving and grading of any part of any street or alley occupied by or required by franchise obligation to be paid by it, and the assessment levied for the cost of such improvement chargeable to a railway company shall be a first and prior lien against the entire franchise and property of the company within such district, and also without the district, but within the city limits, excepting any lien thereon to secure the payment of general taxes; and all the terms, conditions and provisions in this article contained relative to the collection of the amounts chargeable against tracts or parcels of land assessed shall be applicable in the enforcement and collection of such assessment against such railway company, and the property of such railway shall be sold by the city as in cases of default in payment of general taxes levied thereon; but railway trackage shall not be considered or computed as assessable frontage, in determining the sufficiency of petitions or remonstrance as provided in this division. 
(Code 1962, § 9-10-14) 
Sec. 14-77. - Intersections. 
    The cost of improvements in street intersections may be segregated and such cost, except the share assessable to street or other railway companies, may be assessed upon all frontage of the street improved and on intersecting street within a distance of one-half block in each direction from such intersections, in proportion to the frontage of each lot or tract on the street improved or on an intersecting street, or on both within such distance. The cost of the improvement of an alley intersection may be assessed upon the real estate in the same block extending to the nearest street intersection and one-half the length of the block along its sides; provided, that where the sides of blocks are of unequal length, the city council may determine the limit of assessment. The cost of improving street and alley intersections may be treated as one (1) of the costs of any improvement without separately segregating such intersection cost. In such case the total cost of any improvement shall be assessed as provided in this division upon the basis determined without any separate assessment for intersection costs.

(Code 1962, § 9-10-18) 
Sec. 14-81. - Some-Assessment of costs.

The cost of subdistrict laterals shall be assessed in like manner upon all the real estate in the subdistrict. The construction, however, of any submain may be omitted until such time as it may be required, in which case subdistricts so left without submains shall not be assessed for any part of the cost of submains constructed along, with and as a part of the sewer district. Whenever submains so omitted are required and constructed they may be ordered as provided for other sewers, and their cost shall be assessed to the subdistricts which are supplied with submains. 
(b)  No lot, premises or tract in any sewer in any sewer district shall be connected with the sewer district sewer unless, before the completion a pro rata share of the estimated cost shall be, or after completion the assessment has been, paid except that in cases where the cost of sewers is to be assessed upon property in a district and the payment therefor has been fixed by the city council to be made in installments, then connections may be made at any time when deemed advisable by the city engineer. 
(c)  If in any sewer district any assessment upon the lots therein for the construction of the sewer has in any court of competent jurisdiction been held illegal, the owner of any lot in such district shall only be permitted to connect with such sewer upon payment into the treasury for the use of the holder of warrants or bonds issued for the construction of such sewer, or if such warrants and bonds have been taken up then into the general fund of the city, such amount as may be fixed by ordinance. Nothing contained in this article concerning sewer districts shall be construed as applicable to storm sewers and drains acquired as a part of a street improvement program.

No bond interest rate shall at any time exceed the interest rate, or lower or lowest rate if more than one, borne by the special assessments, but any bond interest rate may be the same as or less than any assessment interest rate, subject to the aforesaid limitation, as the council may determine. In advertising for construction bids as provided in section 14-55, the council may stipulate that the contractor must accept bonds in payment of the contract price as provided in this section. 
    In connection with the issuance of bonds payable solely from special assessments, the council may provide by ordinance or resolution that all registered electors of the city shall be eligible to vote on the question or that only electors of the district shall be eligible to vote on the question. In connection with the issuance of bonds payable from special assessments which are additionally secured by a pledge of any other funds of the city, including the surplus and deficiency fund, the council may provide by ordinance or resolution for the submission of the question of issuing the bonds to all registered electors of the city.

Such assessments shall be applied to the payment of the bonds issued for the same district only, until the payment of all such bonds. The payment of such bonds may be, if provided in the ordinance authorizing issuance of the bonds, additionally secured by a pledge of the special surplus and deficiency fund and a pledge that whenever four-fifths (?) of the bonds of any public improvement district have been paid and cancelled, and for any reason the remaining assessments are not paid in time to take up the final bonds of the district and there is not sufficient money in such special surplus and deficiency fund, then the city shall pay such bonds when due and reimburse itself by collecting the unpaid assessments due the district. The payment of any bonds, both as to principal and interest, may also be additionally secured as otherwise provided in the ordinance authorizing issuance of the bonds. Such bonds or the proceeds therefrom may be used to pay for engineering and clerical service and supplies, inspection, collecting assessments, advertising, printing, accrued interest on outstanding bonds, fiscal services, legal services, reserves, and other incidentals.

The failure of any bondholder so to proceed as provided in this division shall not relieve the city, the council, or any city officers, agents and employees of any liability for failure to perform or carry out any duty, obligation or other commitment.

Refunding bonds so issued may be sold at public or private sales or may be exchanged dollar for dollar for the bonds to be refunded. If sold, the proceeds of sale may be escrowed for the payment of the bonds to be refunded in such manner as may be provided in the ordinance authorizing the refunding bonds.

(Code 1962, § 9-10-37) 
Sec. 14-123. - Liens. 
(a)  All assessments made in pursuance of this division shall be a lien from the date of its publication after final passage in the several amounts assessed against each tract or parcel of land and the property of any street or railway company assessed. A lien shall not, however, attach to any tract or parcel of land so assessed which is owned by the state, or any agency, instrumentality, or corporation thereof, or any county, municipality, school district, special or quasi-municipal district, other political subdivision, or private corporation operating a public utility, except a street or railway company. As to any subdivision or any real estate assessed in pursuance of this division, the assessments shall in each case be a lien upon all the subdivisions in proportion to their respective shares, except for real estate owned by such a public corporation or privately owned public utility. The lien for each such assessment shall be prior and superior to all other liens, claims, encumbrances and titles, whether prior in time or not, and shall constitute such a lien until paid, except as follows: 
(1)  Any assessment lien is subordinate and junior to any lien for general (ad valorem) taxes and is subject to extinguishment by the sale of any property on account of the nonpayment of general taxes. 
(2)  Any assessment lien on any tract or parcel of land is prior and superior to any assessment lien thereon subsequently levied.

All such assessments may at the election of the owner be paid in installments with interest as provided in this division, whenever the city council so authorizes the payment of assessments. Failure to pay the whole assessment within such period of thirty (30) days shall be conclusively considered and held an election on the part of all persons interested, whether under disability or otherwise, to pay in installments the amount of the assessment then unpaid. All persons so electing to pay in installments shall be conclusively considered and held as consenting to the improvements, and such election shall be conclusively considered and held as a waiver of any and all rights to question the power or jurisdiction of the city to construct or otherwise acquire the improvements, the quality of the work, the regularity or sufficiency of the proceedings or the validity or correctness of the assessment. The owner of any piece of real estate may at any time pay the whole unpaid principal with the interest accrued to the next interest payment date, together with penalties and prepayment premium, if any, as specified in the assessing ordinance. Subject to the foregoing provisions all installments both of principal and interest shall be payable at such times as may be determined in and by the assessing ordinance. The council may, by ordinance, direct the finance director/treasurer to collect any amount payable as an assessment pursuant to this chapter or authorize the finance director/treasurer or other appropriate city official to enter into contracts with third parties for assistance in the administration and collection of assessments. If the council does not direct, by ordinance, that assessment payments be collected by the finance director/treasurer then such payments shall be collected by the county treasurer.

Sec. 14-126. - Upon failure to pay. 
    Failure to pay any installment, whether principal or interest, when due shall ipso facto cause the whole amount of the unpaid principal to become due and payable immediately, and the whole amount of the unpaid principal and accrued interest shall thereafter draw interest at the rate of one (1) percent per month or fraction of a month until the day of sale (not exceeding, however, at any time a total interest amount due of thirty (30) percent of the principal amount of the assessment), until the time of the issuance of a delinquency certificate, plus two (2) percent additional on unpaid principal and accrued interest as penalties, plus costs of collection. At any time prior to the day of sale, the owner may pay the amount of delinquent installments with accrued interest at one (1) percent per month, or fraction of a month as aforesaid, and all penalties and costs of collection accrued and shall thereupon be restored to the right thereafter to pay in installments in the same manner as if default had not been made. 
(Code 1962, § 9-10-41) 
Sec. 14-127. - Determination of installments. 
    In case of such election to pay in installments, the assessments shall be payable in two (2) or more installments of principal with interest in all cases on the unpaid principal.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, the number, amounts, and times of payment of installments, the period of payment, and the rate and times of payment of interest shall be determined by the council and set forth in the assessing ordinance, provided that the ordinance may delegate the determination of the interest rate to the finance director/treasurer. If assessments are to be collected by the county treasurer, the times of payment of installments shall be the same as the times of payment of installments of property taxes as specified in section C.R.S. § 39-10-104.5(2). In no event shall the interest rate be less than the highest interest rate borne by the bonds of the local improvement district. 
(Code 1962, § 9-10-42; Ord. No. O-2016-11, § 7, 6-20-16 ) 
Sec. 14-128. - Public notice of time and place of payment. 
    Payments may be made to the finance director at any time within thirty (30) days after the final publication of the assessing ordinance, without penalty or the payment of interest.

Within ten (10) days thereafter the finance director shall prepare and issue to the city a delinquency certificate to the property included in each delinquent assessment, which certificate shall have the force and effect of a sale of such property to the city for the amount thereof. The certificate shall bear date as of the time such assessment or installment became delinquent and shall be for the amount of unpaid principal, accrued interest to the date of delinquency, plus accrued interest thereafter on such principal and accrued interest at the penalty rate designated in this division, plus the penalty charged thereon and collection costs. Such certificate shall contain, besides the description of the property sold, the name of the person assessed, if known, or if unknown, that fact, the amount of the unpaid principal of the assessment and the accrued interest to the date of delinquency, plus the rate of penalty interest and the penalty thereon; the number of the assessment and name of the improvement district in which assessed, and the date when such certificate will go to deed. Such certificates shall be made in duplicate, bound together in books in numerical order and filed in the office of the finance director. 
(Code 1962, § 9-10-44) 
Sec. 14-130. - Delinquency register. 
(a)  Within twenty (20) days after preparing and issuing any delinquency certificate for any tract or parcel of land the finance director/treasurer shall enter the same in a book to be kept by him known as "Local Improvement District Delinquency Certificate Register" which register shall contain in proper columns the number of the assessment, the name of the district in which assessed; name of the person to whom assessed, if known; description of the property sold, corresponding with the description in the certificate and the assessment roll; amount of assessment and interest, and the rate of penalty interest and penalty, and the finance director must regularly number each entry in such register on the margin of such book and put a corresponding number on each original and duplicate delinquency certificate. Such register must contain blank spaces following each entry of a delinquency certificate therein, in which may be entered the name of an assignee thereof, the date of such assignment and the amount paid by the assignee; the name of a redemptioner thereof, the date of such redemption and the amount paid by such redemptioner.

Sec. 19-51. - Legislative declaration. 
    The city council finds: 
(1)  That an increasing number of businesses and homes are providing protection from burglary and robbery by means of electronic alarm systems, some of which include automatic dialing devices; 
(2)  Such alarm systems, while providing a desirable degree of protection from such crimes, are subject to signaling false alarms because of storms, electrical malfunctions, nonemergency activation, and other causes; 
(3)  The increasing number of false alarms has unreasonably burdened emergency service response capabilities of the city by causing dispatch of personnel and vehicles to nonemergency situations; 
(4)  Direct dialing systems which are used within the city are programmed to dial city emergency numbers and are capable of totally blocking the emergency communication system; and 
(5)  For the foregoing reasons it is necessary to protect the emergency response potential of the city by protecting the communication system from false dispatch and blockage by alarm systems.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2000-10, § 1, adopted May 2, 2000, repealed provisions formerly set out as Art. V of this chapter and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Former Art. V, §§ 21-66-21-75, pertained to excavations and derived from the 1962 Code, §§ 9-3-1-9-3-9, 9-3-13; Ord. No. 1987-5, § 1, adopted March 3, 1987. 

Sec. 21-66. - Legislative purpose. 
    Public and private uses of public rights-of-way for location of facilities employed in the provision of public services should be accommodated, in the interests of the general welfare, however, the City of Durango must insure that the primary purpose of the right-of-way, passage of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, is maintained to the greatest extent possible. This article provides principles, procedures and associated funding for the placement of structures and facilities, construction excavation encroachments and work activities within or upon any public right-of-way, and to protect the integrity of the road system. To achieve these purposes, it is necessary to require permits of permanent private users of the public rights-of-way, to establish permit procedures, and to fix and collect fees and charges. The value of other public and private installations, roadways, facilities and properties should be protected, competing uses must be reconciled, and the public safety preserved. The use of the right-of-way corridors by permanent private users is secondary to these public objectives, and the movement of traffic. This article is intended to strike a balance between the public need for efficient, safe transportation routes and the use of rights-of-way for location of facilities by public and private entities, to insure that the public safety is maintained and that public inconvenience is minimized. The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect the city's infrastructure by establishing repair standards for the pavement, facilities, and property in the public rights-of-way, when work is accomplished; 
(2)  To facilitate work within the rights-of-way through an efficient permit process and the standardization of regulations; 
(3)  To promote cooperation among the permittees (as defined herein) and the city in the occupation of the public rights-of-way, and work therein, in order to (i) eliminate duplication that is wasteful, unnecessary or unsightly, (ii) lower the permittee's and the city's costs of providing services to the public, and (iii) minimize street cuts; and 
(4)  To assure that the city can continue to fairly and responsibly protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

The permittee, for itself and its related entities, agents, employees, subcontractors, and the agents and employees of said subcontractors, shall save the city harmless, defend, and indemnify the city, its successors, assigns, officers, employees, agents, and appointed and elected officials from and against all liability or damage and all claims or demands whatsoever in nature, and reimburse the city for all its reasonable expenses, as incurred, arising out of the installation, maintenance, operation or any other work or activity in the public right-of-way or by the permittee related to its use thereof, including, but not limited to, the actions of the permittee, its employees, agents, contractors, related entities, successors and assigns, or the securing of and the exercise by the permittee of the permit rights granted in the permit, including any third party claims, administrative hearings, and litigation; whether or not any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by this article or other applicable law.

The city may waive the requirements of any such bond or letter of credit or may permit the applicant to post a bond without surety thereon, upon finding that the applicant has financial stability and assets located in the state to satisfy any claims intended to be protected by the security required by this section. 
    A letter of responsibility will be accepted in lieu of a performance bond or letter of credit from all public utilities and all franchised entities.

Sec. 21-80. - General rights-of-way use and construction. 
(a)  Right-of-way meetings. Permittees shall make reasonable efforts to attend and participate in meetings of the city, of which the permittee is made aware, regarding right-of-way issues that may impact its facilities, including, planning meetings to anticipate joint trenching and boring. Whenever it is possible and reasonably practicable to joint trench or share bores or cuts, permittee shall work with other providers, licensees, permittees, and franchisees so as to reduce, so far as possible, the number of right-of-way cuts within the city. 
(b)  Minimal interference. Work in the right-of-way, on other public property, near public property, or on or near private property shall be done in a manner that causes the least interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners and residents. Permittee's facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such manner as not to interfere with sewers, water pipes, or any other property of the city, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits, pedestals, structures, or other facilities that may have been laid in the rights-of-way by, or under, the city's authority. The permittee's facilities shall be located, erected and maintained so as not to endanger or interfere with the lives of persons, or to interfere with new improvements the city may deem proper to make, or to unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the rights-of-way or other public property. Such facilities shall not interfere with the travel and use of public places by the public during the construction, repair, operation or removal thereof, and shall not obstruct or impede traffic. 
(c)  Underground construction and use of poles. When required by general ordinances, resolutions, regulations or rules of the city or applicable state or federal law, permittee's facilities shall be placed underground at permittee's expense. Placing facilities underground does not preclude the use of ground-mounted appurtenances. 
    Where all facilities are installed underground at the time of permittee's construction, or when all such facilities are subsequently placed underground, all permittee facilities shall also be placed underground at no expense to the city unless funding is generally available for such relocation to all users of the rights-of-way. Related equipment, such as pedestals, must be placed in accordance with the city's applicable code requirements and specifications. In areas where existing facilities are aerial, the permittee may install aerial facilities. 
(d)  Above ground construction. For above ground facilities, the permittee shall utilize existing poles and conduit unless specifically authorized in writing by the director. 
(e)  City use of trenches or bores. Should the city desire to place its own facilities in trenches or bores opened by the permittee, the permittee shall cooperate with the city in any construction by the permittee that involves trenching or boring, provided that the city has first notified the permittee in some manner that it is interested in sharing the trenches or bores in the area where the permittee's construction is occurring. The permittee shall allow the city to place its facilities in the permittee's trenches and bores, provided the city incurs any incremental increase in cost of the trenching and boring. The city shall be responsible for maintaining its respective facilities buried in the permittee's trenches and bores under this paragraph. 
(f)  Use of conduits by the city. The city may install or affix and maintain its own facilities for city purposes in or upon any and all of permittee's ducts, conduits or equipment in the rights-of-way and other public places, at a charge to be negotiated between the parties (but in no event greater than the lowest price charged by permittee to any other user), to the extent space therein or thereon is reasonably available, and pursuant to all applicable ordinances and codes.

Sec. 21-81. - Common users. 
(a)  The rights-of-way have a finite capacity for containing facilities. Accordingly, whenever the city determines it is impracticable to permit construction of an underground conduit system by any other entity which may at the time have authority to construct or maintain conduits or ducts in the rights-of-way, but excluding entities providing services in competition with permittee, the city may require permittee to afford to such entity the right to use permittee's surplus ducts or conduits in common with permittee, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement for use of surplus ducts or conduits entered into by permittee and the other entity. Nothing herein shall require permittee to enter into an agreement with such entity if, in permittee's reasonable determination, such an agreement could compromise the integrity of the permittee's facilities. 
(b)  Permittee shall give a common user pursuant to this section a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) days notice of its need to occupy a conduit and shall propose that the common user take the first feasible action as follows: 
(1)  Pay revised conduit rent designed to recover the cost of retrofitting the conduit with multiplexing, fiber optics or other space-saving technology sufficient to meet permittee's space needs; 
(2)  Pay revised conduit rent based on the cost of new conduit constructed to meet permittee's space needs; 
(3)  Vacate the needed ducts or conduit; or 
(4)  Construct and maintain sufficient new conduit to meet permittee's space needs. 
(c)  When two (2) or more common users occupy a section of conduit facility, the last user to occupy the conduit facility shall be the first to vacate or construct new conduit. When conduit rent is revised because of retrofitting, space-saving technology or construction of new conduit, all common users shall bear the increased cost. 
(d)  All facilities shall meet any applicable local, state, and federal clearance and other safety requirements, be adequately grounded and anchored, and meet the provisions of contracts executed between permittee and the other common user. Permittee may, at its option, correct any attachment deficiencies and charge the common user for its costs. Each common user shall pay permittee for any fines, fees, damages or other costs the common user's attachments cause permittee to incur. 
(Ord. No. 2000-10, § 1, 5-2-00) 
Sec. 21-82. - Joint planning and construction; coordination of excavations. 
(a)  Excavations in city rights-of-way disrupt and interfere with the public use of city streets and damage the pavement and landscaping. The purpose of this section is to reduce this disruption, interference and damage by promoting better coordination among permittees making excavations in city rights-of-way and between these permittees and the city. Better coordination will assist in minimizing the number of excavations being made wherever feasible, and will ensure the excavations in city rights-of-way are, to the maximum extent possible, performed before, rather than after, the resurfacing of the streets by the city. 
(b)  Any permittee owning, operating or installing facilities in city rights-of-way, providing water, sewer, gas, electric, communication, video or other utility services, shall supply the director, by April 1 of each year, permittee's excavation master plan. Said master plan shall to the extent not already in possession of the city, show a location of the permittee's existing facilities in the city rights-of-way. Permittee shall describe for the director, its excavation master plan, and identify planned major excavation work in the city. As used in this subsection, the term planned major excavation work refers to any future excavations planned by the permittee when the excavation master plan or update is submitted that will affect any city right-of-way for more than five (5) days, provided that the permittee shall not be required to identify future major excavations planned to occur more than three (3) years after the date that the permittee's master plan or update is submitted. Permittee shall use its best efforts to inform the director of any substantial changes in the planned major excavation work presented in the annual report. 
(c)  The director shall keep all excavation master plans confidential to the extent allowed by the provisions of the Colorado Open Records Act, and shall establish procedures to ensure that said excavation master plans are utilized and inspected only for the purposes intended by this article. 
(d)  The director shall prepare a repaving plan showing the street resurfacing planned by the city. The director shall make the city's repaving plan available for public inspection. In addition, after determining the street resurfacing work that is proposed for each year, the director shall send a notice of the proposed work to all permittees that have presented an annual report to the director. 
(e)  Prior to applying for a permit, any person planning to excavate in the city's rights-of-way shall review the city's repaving plan on file with the director and shall coordinate with the utility and street work shown on such plans to minimize damage to, and avoid undue disruption and interference with the public use of such rights-of-way. 
(f)  In performing location of facilities in the public rights-of-way in preparation for construction under a permit, permittee shall compile all information obtained regarding its or any other facilities in the public rights-of-way related to a particular permit, and shall submit that information annually by April 1 of each calendar year to the city in a written and verified format acceptable to the director. 
(g)  Prior to undertaking any work in the rights-of-way or related landscaping, the city may notify all permittees of the city work to be performed. Upon such notification, all permittees shall, within seven (7) days, locate their facilities in the rights-of-way in which the work will be performed, and provide documentation in a format acceptable to the director of the permittee's facilities in that right-of-way.

Any claim for recovery shall include a properly executed release of claim from the taxpayer releasing its claim to the taxes paid to the wrong municipality, evidence to substantiate the claim, and a request that the municipality approve or deny, in whole or in part, the claim within ninety (90) days of its receipt.

(4)  Within ninety (90) days after receipt of a claim for recovery, the city shall verify to its satisfaction whether or not all or a portion of the tax claimed was improperly received, and shall notify the municipality submitting the claim in writing that the claim is either approved or denied in whole or in part, including the reasons for the decision. If the claim is approved in whole or in part, the city shall remit the undisputed amount to the municipality submitting the claim within thirty (30) days of approval. If a claim is submitted jointly by a municipality and a vendor or taxpayer, the check shall be made to the parties jointly. Denial of a claim for recovery may only be made for good cause. 
(5)  The city may deny a claim on the grounds that it has previously paid a claim for recovery arising out of an audit of the same taxpayer. 
(6)  The period subject to a claim for recovery shall be limited to the thirty-six-month period prior to the date the municipality that was wrongly paid the tax receives the claim for recovery.

A brief statement of the penalties shall be printed on each application form for refund.

(a)  All sums of money paid by the purchaser to the retailer as taxes imposed by this article shall be and remain public money, the property of the city; in the hands of such retailer and he shall hold the same in trust for the sole use and benefit of the city until paid to the finance director as herein provided, and for failure to pay the same to the finance director, the retailer shall be punished for a violation hereof. 
(b)  If any person neglects or refuses to make a return in payment of the tax as required by this article the finance director shall make an estimate, based on such information as may be available of the amount of taxes due for the period for which the taxpayer is delinquent; and upon the basis of such estimated amount, compute and assess in addition thereto, a penalty equal to the sum of fifteen dollars ($15.00) for such failure or ten (10) percent thereof and interest on such delinquent taxes at the rate imposed under section 23-35 plus one-half (1/2) percent per month from the date due, not exceeding eighteen (18) percent in the aggregate. Promptly thereafter, the finance director shall give to the delinquent taxpayer written notice of the estimated taxes, penalty and interest, which notice must be served personally or by registered or certified mail. The estimate shall thereupon become an assessment, and such assessment shall be final and due and payable from the taxpayer to the finance director twenty (20) days from the date of service of the notice or the date of mailing by registered or certified mail. An appeal of a notice of assessment issued to a taxpayer for failure to file a return, underpayment of tax owed or as a result of an audit shall be submitted in writing to the finance director within twenty (20) days from the date of the notice of assessment. Any such appeal shall identify the amount of tax disputed and the basis for the appeal. The finance director shall review the appeal and may modify such assessment in accordance with the facts submitted. Aggrieved taxpayers, within twenty (20) days after the decision is mailed to them, may petition the finance director for an administrative hearing in the manner provided in sections 23-44 through 23-46. 
(c)  If any taxes, penalty or interest imposed by this article and shown due by returns filed by the taxpayer or as shown by assessments duly made as provided herein, are not paid within five (5) days after the same are due, the finance director shall issue a notice, setting forth the name of the taxpayer, the amount of tax, penalties and interest, the date of the accrual thereof, and that the city claims a first and prior lien therefor on the real and tangible personal property of the taxpayer except as to preexisting claims or liens of a bona fide mortgagee, pledgee, judgment creditor or purchaser whose rights shall have attached prior to the filing of the notice herein provided on property of the taxpayer, other than the goods, stock in trade, and business fixtures of the taxpayer. The notice shall be on forms prepared by the finance director and shall be verified by him or his duly qualified deputy or any duly qualified agent of the finance director, whose duties are the collection of the tax, and may be filed in the office of the clerk and recorder of any county in this state in which the taxpayer owns real or tangible personal property, and the filing of such notice shall create a lien on the property in that county and constitute a notice thereof. After the notice has been filed, or concurrently therewith, or at any time when taxes due are unpaid, whether the notice be filed or not, the finance director may issue a warrant directed to any duly authorized revenue collector or to the sheriff of any county in this state commanding him to levy upon, seize and sell sufficient of the real and personal property of the tax debtor found within his county for the payment of the amount due, together with interest, penalties and costs, as now or hereafter provided by this Code, subject to valid preexisting claims or liens as herein provided. 
(d)  The revenue collector or sheriff shall forthwith levy upon sufficient of the property of the taxpayer, or any property used by the taxpayer in conducting his retail business, and the property so levied upon shall be sold in all respects, with like effect and in the same manner as is prescribed by law in respect to executions against property upon judgment of a court of record, and the remedies of garnishments shall apply. The sheriff shall be entitled to such fees in executing the warrant as are allowed by law for similar services. 
(e)  Any lien for taxes as shown on the records of the county clerks and recorders as herein provided shall, upon the payment of all taxes, penalties and interest covered thereby, be released by the finance director in the same manner as mortgages or judgments are released. 
(f)  The finance director may also treat any such taxes, penalties or interest due and unpaid as a debt due the city from the vendor. In case of failure to pay the tax, or any portion thereof, or any penalty or interest thereon when due, the finance director may recover at law the amount of such taxes, penalties and interest in any justice, county or district court of the county wherein the taxpayer resides or has his principal place of business having jurisdiction of the amounts sought to be collected. The return of the taxpayer or the assessment made by the finance director as herein provided, shall be prima facie proof of the amount due. Such actions may be actions in attachments, and writs of attachment may be issued to the constable or sheriff as the case may be, and in any such proceeding no bond shall be required of the finance director, nor shall any constable or sheriff require of the finance director an indemnifying bond for executing the writ of attachment, or writ of execution upon any judgment entered in such proceedings; and the finance director may prosecute appeals or writs of error in such cases without the necessity of providing bond therefor. It shall be the duty of the attorney of the city when requested by the finance director to commence action for the recovery of taxes due under this article, and the remedy shall be in addition to all other existing remedies, or remedies provided in this article. 
(g)  In any action affecting the title to real estate or the ownership or rights to possession of personal property, the city may be made a party defendant for the purpose of obtaining a judgment or determination of its lien upon the property involved therein. 
(h)  The finance director is hereby authorized to waive, for good cause shown, any penalty assessed as in this article provided.

(b)  Within fifteen (15) days after filing a notice of appeal as provided in this section, the taxpayer shall file with the district court a surety bond in twice the amount of the taxes, interest and other charges stated in the final decision by the finance director which are contested on appeal.

The taxpayer may, at his option, deposit the disputed amount with the finance director in lieu of posting a surety bond. If such amount is so deposited, no further interest shall accrue on the deficiency contested during the pendency of the action. At the conclusion of the action, after appeal to the supreme court or the court of appeals or after the time for such appeal has expired, the funds deposited shall be, at the direction of the court, either retained by the finance director and applied against the deficiency or returned in whole or in part to the taxpayer with interest at the rate imposed pursuant to section 23-35. No claim for refund of amounts deposited with the finance director need be made by the taxpayer in order for such amounts to be repaid in accordance with the direction of the court. 
(c)  The district court of the Sixth Judicial District of the state shall have original jurisdiction in proceedings to review all questions of law and fact determined by the finance director in administering the provisions of this article by writ under Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 106(a)(4). The procedure thereunder shall be in conformity with the Rules of Civil Procedure of the State of Colorado.

Sec. 23-131. - Legislative intent. 
    The city council does hereby find, determine and declare: 
(1)  That transportation, distribution and sale of gas within the city through pipelines, mains, and other fixed facilities, using easements and rights-of-way as granted by the city involves the use, availability and potential use of city personnel and facilities and creates the potential for hazards dissimilar to other utility services and may require standby and active service by fire, police and other local safety agencies, as well as the department of public works, and are matters of local and municipal concern. 
(2)  That the nature of companies transporting, distributing and selling gas, and otherwise operating within the city, including without limitation, their demands on city agencies, the use of public and private easements, streets and rights-of-way, and the potential and actual hazards from the operations of such companies, has a substantial effect upon the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city, and upon the expenditures to be budgeted by the city. 
(3)  That, upon review of all matters proper to be considered relating to the operation and hazards of gas companies, the classification of such gas companies as separate businesses and occupations is reasonable, proper, uniform and nondiscriminatory; and the taxable amount hereby levied is reasonable, proper, uniform, nondiscriminatory and necessary for a just and proper distribution of the tax burdens of the city. 
(4)  That the potential for explosions of gas pipelines, as well as explosions related to escaping gas within buildings, indicates that there are dangers to the property and lives of the citizens of the city from the operation of gas companies within the city. 
(5)  That the use by a gas company of the streets, alleys and public rights-of-way located within the city is a valuable special privilege not provided to the public generally and for which the city is entitled to consideration in the form of occupation tax revenues. 
(6)  That the occupation tax herein created and defined is imposed on the right of gas companies to do business within the city as are other occupation taxes so created and imposed in the city.

(4)  The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge permitted under a CDPS, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the MS4 by the director. 
(5)  Nothing contained herein shall be construed to relieve any person discharging or causing to be discharged water into the MS4 from any liability for damage caused by the volume or quality or water discharged. If the director finds that any of the activities listed above are found to cause or may cause sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes to be discharged into the MS4 or receiving waters, the director shall so notify the person performing such activities, and shall order that such activities be stopped or conducted in such a manner as to avoid the discharge of sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the MS4 and receiving waters. 
(b)  Prohibition of illicit connections. 
(1)  The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the MS4 is prohibited. 
(2)  This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
(3)  A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(c)  Prohibition and requirements of illegal conditions. 
(1)  It shall be unlawful to allow materials to be deposited in such a manner or location as to constitute a threatened discharge into storm drains, gutters or waters of the state. Domestic or industrial wastes that are no longer contained in a pipe, tank or other container are considered to be threatened discharges unless they are actively being cleaned up. 
(2)  Watercourse protection. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(3)  Minimization of irrigation runoff. A discharge of irrigation water that is of sufficient quantity to cause a concentrated flow in the MS4 is prohibited. Irrigation systems shall be managed to reduce the discharge of water from a site. 
(4)  Cleaning of paved surfaces required. The owner of any paved parking lot, street or drive shall clean the pavement as required to prevent the buildup and discharge of pollutants. The visible buildup of mechanical fluid, waste materials, sediment or debris is a violation of this article. Paved surfaces shall be cleaned by dry sweeping, wet vacuum sweeping, collection and treatment of wash water and discharge to sanitary sewer or other methods in compliance with this article. 
(5)  Mobile cleaning operations. Mobile cleaning operations shall not discharge to the MS4 in violation of this article. 
(6)  Maintenance of equipment. Any leak or spill related to equipment maintenance in an outdoor, uncovered area shall be contained to prevent the potential release of pollutants.

Sec. 25-177. - Suspension of MS4 access. 
(a)  Suspension due to illicit discharge in emergency situations. The city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or watercourses. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or watercourses, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(b)  Suspension due to detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the director.

Sec. 25-179. - Access and inspection of properties and facilities. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
(b)  Access to facilities. 
(1)  The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the city inspector. 
(2)  Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an CDPS permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
(3)  The city shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the director to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharges. 
(4)  The city has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
(6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city inspector access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility with a CDPS permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the city inspector authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article. 
(7)  If the city inspector has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and they are able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the director may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

Sec. 25-180. - Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of BMPs. 
    The city will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility, which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the MS4, or watercourses. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid CDPS permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the CDPS permit.

In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the director in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the director within three (3) business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3) years.

Section 3. - Term of franchise: 
    The term of this Franchise shall be twenty (20) years from the effective date hereof. Any renewals of this Franchise shall comply with the provisions and requirements of applicable Federal, state or local law and the Charter of the City of Durango, Colorado. 
    Notwithstanding the stated term of this Franchise, this Franchise shall be terminable by the City for cause, as more specifically hereinafter provided. 
Section 4. - Exclusion from franchise: 
(a)  This Franchise does not grant to the Franchisee the right, privilege or authority to engage in the community antenna (or cable) television business, although nothing herein contained shall preclude the Franchisee (1) from permitting those lawfully engaged in such business to utilize the Franchisee's facilities within the City for such purposes, or (2) from providing such service if appropriate authority is obtained. 
(b)  The right to use and/or occupy public ways and public places for the purposes set forth herein shall be exclusive to the Franchisee; provided, however, the City reserves the right to generate and distribute electric power and the use of public ways and other public places for such purposes. Nothing within this Franchise Agreement shall preclude or restrict the City or any of its citizens who are customers of Franchisee from generating electric power from alternative sources. Franchisee shall, upon request, provide necessary interconnections in compliance with applicable State and Federal law for the purpose of transmitting such electrical power from the alternative sources to Franchisee's facilities and shall provide production meters necessary for measuring the net power produced by such alternative sources which transmitted to Franchisee's facilities. Such interconnections and production meters shall be provided in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost as recognized by the electric industry. Net power from alternative sources connected to Franchisee's facilities shall be credited to the account of the producing party or parties at a rate not less than the rate Franchisee pays to its wholesale supplier of electrical power and in compliance with the rules, regulations, tariffs and policies of the Franchisee in effect at the time of interconnection. Franchisee's accommodation of power from alternative sources shall be subject to contractual limitations imposed by Franchisee's wholesale supplier and any limitations imposed by State or Federal law. 
    Franchisee and the City agree to work cooperatively to explore and attempt to develop a Franchise policy or tariff that allows for a system of remote net metering that is of benefit to Franchisee and its members, but would not be subsidized by other customers of Franchisee. 
(c)  This ordinance does not grant to the Franchisee the right, privilege or authority to use or occupy any parks or park land of the City currently used or so designated or as in the future may be so used or designated except to the extent that the Franchisee is currently using or occupying said parks or park land and as otherwise authorized in writing by the City. Franchisee shall not expand its use or occupancy of said parks or park land except by specific written authorization of the City; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall limit or restrict the Franchisee's right to maintain, renovate, repair or replace any of Franchisee's facilities currently occupying said parks or park land. 
(d)  The City retains the following rights with regard to this Franchise: 
(1)  Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, to use, control and regulate, through the exercise if its police power, the use of public ways and other public places. 
(2)  To impose such other regulations, by ordinance, resolution or charter amendment, as may be determined by the City Council to be necessary in the exercise of its police power to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public; provided, however, Franchisee shall not be subject to nor required to comply with any ordinance directed solely at Franchisee or which fails to place similar burdens upon persons or entities similarly situated. Nothing herein contained shall limit or restrict the Franchisee's right to challenge the validity of any such regulations. 
Section 5. - Effective date: 
    This ordinance shall become effective upon January 1, 2013, conditioned upon the approval by the City Council and execution by the Mayor of the City and approval of the electorate concerning the issuance of a Franchise to Franchisee as required pursuant to Section 1 of Article IX of the Charter of the City of Durango, Colorado. 
Section 6. - Franchise fee: 
    In consideration for the grant of this Franchise, the Franchisee shall pay the City a sum equal to four and sixty-seven hundredths percent (4.67%) of all Energy Charge Revenue, as hereinabove defined, received from the sale of electricity to customers within the City. Payment of the franchise fee shall not exempt the Franchisee from any lawful taxation upon its property or from sales and use taxes and from fees and taxes that are uniform and of general applicability within the Franchise Area. All amounts paid to the Franchisee by the City or any of its departments for electric service shall be excluded from computation of the franchise fee. 
    The franchise fee shall be paid to the City monthly within twenty (20) days of the close of each month. At the time payment of the franchise fee is made from Franchisee to the City, Franchisee shall also provide to the City a monthly report of gross revenues, including an itemized statement of Energy Charge Revenues, as herein defined, during the preceding month which substantiates the accompanying payment. The City reserves the right to require evidence of certified financial statements to support the franchise fee paid by the Franchisee, and to otherwise audit the books and records of the Franchisee as is deemed necessary by the City. In the event that any such audit shows that Franchisee has underpaid the franchise fee, Franchisee shall reimburse the City for the underpayment, together with any applicable interest. Should the audit reflect an underpayment of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or more, Franchisee shall pay to the City the cost of the audit. Failure to pay franchise fees within thirty (30) days of the date due shall result in a one percent (1%) per month penalty for each month, or portion thereof, until the delinquent franchise fee had been paid to the City. Failure to pay franchise fees for a period of ninety (90) days or more shall be grounds for termination of this Franchise as more specifically hereinafter provided. 
Section 7. - Payment of fee refundable: 
    In the event the Franchisee is required or allowed by an appropriate authority having jurisdiction in the premises to make a refund or other adjustment in its rates to its customers, the franchise fee payments shall be similarly adjusted consistent with the order of refund or other adjustment. The Franchisee shall also be allowed to adjust the franchise fee payments to reflect the net write-off of uncollectable accounts. Except as otherwise provided herein, in the event that the Franchisee overpays the franchise fee in an amount less than or equal to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), credit for the overpayment shall be taken by the Franchisee against the next franchise fee payment. If the Franchisee overpays the franchise fee in an amount greater than $5,000.00 but less than $25,000.00, the City shall be allowed up to three (3) years within which to refund the overpayment. If the overpayment is in an amount greater than $25,000.00, the City shall be allowed up to five (5) years within which to refund any such overpayment. All refunds shall take the form of a credit against the amounts otherwise owing by the Franchisee to the City as franchise fees. In no event shall the City be required to refund any overpayment made as a result of an error by the Franchisee which occurred more than three (3) years prior to the discovery of the Franchisee's error. Upon discovery by the Franchisee of any such error by the Franchisee, the Franchisee shall promptly notify the City of the discovery. 
Section 8. - Contract obligation: 
    This Franchise Ordinance constitutes a valid and binding contract between the City and the Franchisee. In the event that the Franchise fee specified in this ordinance is declared illegal, unconstitutional or void for any reason by any Court or other proper authority, the Franchisee shall be contractually bound to pay the City a monthly occupation tax or fee in an aggregate amount that would be, as nearly as practical, equivalent to the amount which would have been paid by the Franchisee as a franchise fee hereunder. 
Section 9. - Supervision by city manager: 
    The City Manager, or official City representative, is hereby designated the official of the City having full power and authority to take appropriate action for and on behalf of the City and its inhabitants to enforce the provisions of this Franchise and to investigate any alleged violations of failures of the Franchisee to comply with the provisions hereof or to adequately and fully discharge its responsibilities and obligations hereunder. The failure or omission of said official City representative to so act shall not constitute any waiver or estoppel nor limit independent action by other City officials. 
    In order to facilitate such duties of the said official City representative, the Franchisee agrees: 
(a)  To allow said official City representative reasonable access to any part of the Franchisee's plant, works and systems, and that said City official may observe and require tests to determine the quality of the electric service supplied to the customers of the Franchisee, with particular reference to the standards of service provided herein and as may be prescribed by the rules and regulations and tariffs of the Franchisee approved by the USDA, Rural Utilities Service ("RUS") or the Public Utilities Commission from time to time, if any. 
(b)  That the official City representative may investigate and convey to the Franchisee any complaint of any customer of the Franchisee within the City with respect to the quality and price of electric service and the appropriate standards thereof. 
(c)  Upon request to submit to said official City representative copies of all filings which the Franchisee makes with the RUS or the Public Utilities Commission, including, but not limited to, its annual report, all advice letters, and applications, together with existing transcribed supporting testimony and exhibits. In addition, irrespective of whether the City intervenes in a proceeding before the Public Utilities Commission, the Franchisee, upon the City's reasonable notice, not to exceed three (3) business days, will provide the City access to all non-confidential documents provided other parties in connection with any such proceeding. 
(d)  To grant said official City representative reasonable access to the books and records of the Franchisee insofar as they relate to any matters covered by this Franchise and to provide said City official with such reasonable and necessary reports containing or based upon information readily obtainable from the Franchisee's books and records as the City may from time to time request with respect to the electric service supplied under this Franchise. 
Section 10. - Adequate supply at lowest reasonable cost: 
    The Franchisee shall at all times take all reasonable and necessary steps to assure an adequate supply of electricity to its customers at the lowest reasonable cost consistent with long-term reliable supply. Should electric power be made available to the Franchisee, from whatever source, including any agency or instrumentality of the United States of America, regional agency, the City, or locally distributed generation within the City at less total cost than the total cost which would be incurred by the Franchisee to supply such electric power from its own systems and under circumstances which will not adversely affect the Franchisee or its operations, the Franchisee will attempt to purchase such lower cost electric power and to pass on to its customers any savings resulting from the purchase. If the supply of electricity to its customers should be interrupted, the Franchisee shall take all necessary and reasonable actions to restore such supply at the earliest practicable time. The Franchisee shall continue to encourage and provide programs for its customers to receive electric power generated locally from renewable sources and to seek to purchase locally generated electric power for use by residents in the City in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(b). 
Section 11. - City review of construction design: 
    Except in emergency circumstances, prior to construction of any significant electric facilities (i.e. substations and transmission lines), or of a building or similar structure within the City, the Franchisee shall furnish to the City a description of the type and proposed location thereof, unless the City has previously notified the Franchisee, in writing, that such notice is unnecessary. In addition, upon request, the Franchisee shall assess and report on the impact of its proposed construction upon the City's environment. Such plans and reports may be reviewed by the City to assure, at a minimum: 
(a)  That all applicable laws including building and zoning codes and air and water pollution regulations are complied with; and 
(b)  That City standards pertaining to landscaping are complied with. 
    The Franchisee shall comply with all regulatory requirements of the City and shall incorporate all other reasonable changes requested by the City consistent with prudent engineering practice. 
Section 12. - Compliance with city requirements: 
    The Franchisee will comply with all City requirements regarding curb and pavement cuts, excavation, digging and related construction activities as well as any reasonable direction provided by the City regarding placement of poles and other similar facilities within the City. In no event shall such City direction interfere with prudent engineering practices of the Franchisee. 
    The Franchisee and the City shall meet each year and exchange copies of their reports regarding annual and long-term planning for capital improvement projects with descriptions of construction activities including, to the extent known, the timing and method of construction. Such reports shall be exchanged within thirty (30) days after the issuance thereof. Except for emergencies, all installations shall be coordinated with the City's municipal planning and street improvement, and information systems planning programs. 
Section 13. - Installation and maintenance of facilities: 
(a)  All structures, lines and equipment erected by Franchisee within the City shall be so located as to cause minimum interference as determined by the City, consistent with prudent engineering practice, with the proper use of public ways and public places, and so as to cause minimum interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners. The Franchisee shall submit to the City plans for construction of any transmission line extension within the City for approval of location prior to the commencement of construction. Any plans submitted for such approval shall be approved or denied within fifteen (15) business days of submittal. Failure to approve or deny within said fifteen (15) day period shall be deemed approval of the submitted plans. Approval of location shall not be unreasonably withheld by the City. Any construction in street, alleys or public ways shall comply with Sections 21-66 and 21-68 of the City Code and the Franchisee or its contractor shall also submit, prior to construction, a traffic control plan consistent with Policy 84-3 of the City, a copy of which has been furnished to the Franchisee. Where poles, conduits or other wire-holding structures of any public utility are available for use by Franchisee, the Franchisee shall use such poles, conduits and structures if the permission and consent of such public utility can be obtained by Franchisee and such use is consistent with prudent engineering practice. 
(b)  In cases of Franchisee's disturbance of any public way or public place, Franchisee shall, at its own cost and expense, and in a manner approved by the City, replace and restore such public way or public place in as good condition as existed before the work involving such disturbance was commenced, such reasonable determination to be made by the City accordance with applicable street standards as adopted by the City. All Franchisee's structures, lines, equipment and connections in, over, under and upon all streets shall be kept and maintained by the Franchisee in a safe and suitable condition, and in good order and repair as determined by the City in accordance with prudent engineering practice. In the event that the City incurs any out of pocket expenses paid to third-parties who are not employees of the City to obtain compliance with the Franchisee's use of any public way or public place, Franchisee shall reimburse the City for such expenses reasonably incurred. 
(c)  Upon receipt of reasonable advance notice, not to be less than five (5) business days, the Franchisee shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, temporarily relocate in the public way, or temporarily remove from the public way, any property of the Franchisee when lawfully required by the City by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, freeway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, gas or water pipes, or any other type of public structures or improvements by the City; provided, however, Franchisee shall in all cases have the right of abandonment of its property. If public funds are separately available to any utility using such public way for the purpose of defraying the cost of such disconnection, temporary relocation or temporary removal, such funds shall also be made available to the Franchisee. 
(d)  Any fixtures placed in any public way by Franchisee shall be placed in such a manner as not to interfere with the usual travel on such public way as determined by the City. 
(e)  Franchisee shall, upon request of any person holding a special transport permit issued by the City, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the Franchisee shall have the authority to require such payment, in advance. Franchisee shall be given not less than forty-eight (48) hours advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire relocation. 
(f)  Upon forty-eight (48) hours advance notice to the City, Franchisee shall have authority to trim trees that are overhanging public ways and public places of the franchise area, so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires of Franchisee. Notice shall not be required of Franchisee in cases of emergency. At the option of the City, such trimming may be done by the City or by a third-party under the City's supervision and direction at the reasonable expense of the Franchisee. Should the trimming of trees by Franchisee result in the destruction of any otherwise healthy trees, Franchisee shall be responsible for the reasonable cost of replacement or reasonable compensation to the owner thereof. All pruning, trimming or removal of trees shall be accomplished in accordance with the requirements of Sections 26-56 through 26-62 of the Durango City Code. 
(g)  The City shall have the right to make additional use, for any public or municipal purpose, of any conduits controlled or maintained by or for Franchisee in any public way, provided such use by the City does not interfere with the present or future reasonable usage of such conduits by Franchisee. In the event of such usage, the City shall indemnify and hold harmless the Franchisee against and from any and all claims, demands, causes of action, cost or liabilities of every kind and nature whatsoever arising out of such use of the Franchisee's conduits, inclusive of reasonable attorney's fees. The size and quantity of any conduits utilized by Franchisee for extension of electric or fiber optic transmission or distribution lines shall be of sufficient size, as approved by the City, to allow use by other franchisees of the City or the City consistent with prudent engineering practice. Franchisee shall also have the right to make additional use of conduits controlled or maintained exclusively by the City, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the City against and from any and all claims, demands, causes of action, costs or liabilities of every kind and nature whatsoever arising out of such use of the City's conduits, inclusive of reasonable attorney's fees. 
Section 14. - Permanent relocation of franchisee's facilities: 
    If at any time the City requests the Franchisee to permanently relocate any facilities installed or maintained in public ways pursuant to this Franchise or previous franchises, in order to permit the City to make any use of public ways to construct any public improvement or to build any public project, such relocation shall be made by the Franchisee at its expense and shall be completed within a reasonable time not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days from the date on which the City requests that such relocation work commence; provided, however, that such time period may be enlarged with the approval of the City, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Franchisee shall, in any event, be granted an extension of time for completion of the relocation equivalent to any delay caused by conditions not under Franchisee's control. Following the relocation of Franchisee's facilities, all property disturbed by said relocation shall be restored to substantially its former condition by the Franchisee at its expense. Except where required to serve the City as a customer, nothing herein contained shall be construed to impose any obligation upon the City to make any payment for any relocation of Franchisee's facilities. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to require relocation of Franchisee's facilities within private easements or privately held property rights of the Franchisee. The Franchisee and the City will cooperate and incorporate the best engineering and construction practices to facilitate relocation of facilities sooner than the one hundred eighty days (180) when "build/design" practices are utilized by the City. 
Section 15. - Non-interference with public works: 
    The Franchisee's facilities shall not interfere in any way with the City's telecommunication facilities, traffic signal lights or with water or sewer mains or other municipal uses of public ways or public places. All such facilities shall be installed on City and private property so as to cause minimal interference with such public works facilities. 
Section 16. - Restoration of service: 
    In the event the Franchisee's electric system, or any part thereof is partially or wholly destroyed or incapacitated, the Franchisee shall use due diligence to restore its system to satisfactory service within the shortest practicable time.

    Franchisee shall construct, operate and maintain all underground distribution facilities within the Franchise Area within a legally established easement, if public ways are not such to accommodate the such facilities. Nothing contained in this section shall require Franchisee to construct, operate or maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances, pedestals or other related equipment. 
    When undertaking a project of undergrounding, either as a matter of Franchisee's convenience or when required pursuant to this Section, the City and the Franchisee shall work with other utilities or companies which have their lines overhead to attempt to have all lines underground as part of the same project. The Franchisee shall not be required to pay the cost of any other utility or company in connection with work under this section. 
Section 18. - Compliance with climate and pollution laws: 
    In continued compliance with environmental laws the Franchisee shall use its best efforts to take measures which will result in its facilities and operations meeting the standards required by applicable City, county, state and federal environmental laws and laws regulating the transportation of hazardous substances and wastes. Every two years while this agreement is in effect, the Franchisee will provide the City with a status report of such measures. 
Section 19. - Technological and efficiency improvements: 
    The Franchisee shall generally test, introduce, encourage the use of and install, as soon as practicable, technological advances in its distribution facilities equipment and service within the City when such advances are technically and economically feasible, and are safe and beneficial to the City and its residents and especially where such advances relate to the increased and more efficient energy efficiency and use of renewably generated electric power. The Franchisee shall review and annually report advances which have occurred in the electric utility industry that have been incorporated into the Franchisee's operations in the City during the previous year or will be so incorporated within the six (6) months following completion of said report. 
    The Franchisee shall cooperate with the City in allowing the City to comment on the Franchisee's Rules and Regulations, and Policies for net metering and renewable generation opportunities, as well as energy efficiency programs. 
Section 20. - Service to new areas: 
    If, during the term of this Franchise, the boundaries of the City are expanded, the Franchisee shall extend service to residents of the newly incorporated areas in accordance with the Franchisee's extension policy at the earliest practicable time.

Section 21. - Reports in operations of franchisee: 
    The Franchisee shall submit reasonable financial and other necessary reports containing or based on information from the Franchisee's books and records as the City may from time to time request with respect to the operations of the Franchisee under this Franchise, provided that such information can be provided at a reasonable cost. Such reports may be changed from time to time as may be mutually agreeable between the City and the Franchisee. Initially, the City requests the following reports, on or before May 1 of each year commencing May 1, 2013: 
(a)  On an annual basis the return earned by the Franchisee on operations and the rate base used for calculation of such return as is currently provided or as may in the future be provided to the Public Utilities Commission in conjunction with various adjustment clause provisions. 
(b)  A list of all real property and leasehold interests in real property owned by the Franchisee within the municipal boundaries of Durango as the same may be changed from time to time, excepting public and other easements.

Section 23. - Joint use: 
    The Franchisee shall permit use of its facilities by the City, including use by the City's fiber network used strictly for municipal use, or other Franchisees of the City so long as such grantees are not in competition with the Franchisee and so long as such grantees obtain the permission of the City and pay to the Franchisee the appropriate fees, if any; provided, such joint use shall not unreasonably interfere with the Franchisee's use of these facilities, and provided also that said use does not create a safety hazard nor result in any additional expense or the assumption of any additional liability by the Franchisee. The Franchisee and the City agree to use RUS-approved joint use agreements and all provisions and requirements of the RUS-approved joint use agreement shall remain enforceable, except that the Franchisee shall waive any attachment fees for those attachments on Franchisee's facilities located in the Public Way. 
Section 24. - Annexation to the city: 
    When any property owned by the Franchisee is or becomes eligible for voluntary annexation to the City and is not simultaneously eligible for voluntary annexation to another municipal corporation, the Franchisee shall petition to annex the same to the City upon request made by the City; provided, no condition of such annexation shall impair the Franchisee's ownership or then existing use of its property and water or water rights for public utility purposes. Except as herein provided, the Franchisee agrees to meet all terms and conditions imposed upon the annexation by the City that are not more stringent than those imposed generally upon property owners seeking annexation of their land to the City. The Franchisee shall be exempt from a public donation of land, money or water rights arising from such mandatory annexation under this section to the extent that the land being annexed is committed, dedicated and being fully utilized by facilities related to generation, transmission or distribution of electric service under this ordinance, and provided further that said exemption from public donation shall not extend to any unimproved land or land not so directly committed, dedicated and currently used. 
Section 25. - City held harmless: 
    The Franchisee shall construct, maintain and operate its facilities in a manner which provides reasonable protection against injury or damage to persons or property; provided, however, said obligation of the Franchisee hereunder shall not increase or decrease its liability on third-party claims; and provided further that the Franchisee's obligation to the City hereunder shall not be diminished by said exception. The Franchisee shall hold the City harmless and indemnify the City from and against all lawsuits, liability, damage, claims, demands, judgment and losses whatsoever in nature, and reimburse the City for all its reasonable expenses arising out of the operations of the Franchisee within the City and the securing of and the exercise by the Franchisee of the Franchise rights granted in this ordinance, including any third-party claims, administrative hearings and litigation. None of the City expenses reimbursed by the Franchisee under this section shall be surcharged. Nothing herein contained shall obligate the Franchisee to hold the City harmless and indemnify the City to the extent any lawsuits, liability, damage, claims, demands, judgments and losses shall have been found to have arisen out of or in connection with any negligent act, failure to act or intentional wrongdoing of the City or of its officers, agents or employees, by final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction in an action where the City is a party. 
Section 26. - Financial responsibility: 
    At the time of the execution of this ordinance, and from time to time at the City's request, not more frequently than annually, the Franchisee shall submit to the City as a confidential document, proof of its ability to meet its obligation to indemnify the City as required by Section 25 of this ordinance. This proof may take the form of insurance coverage, adequate funding of self-insurance, or the provision of a bond. The City may require, from time to time, and the Franchisee agrees to provide, additional reasonable funding of the Franchisee's indemnification obligations in the event such obligations are self-insured. Nothing herein contained shall create any right in any third-party or cause the City to be liable to any party for a failure to so act. 
Section 27. - Payment of expenses incurred by city in relation to franchise ordinance: 
    At the City's option, the Franchisee shall pay in advance or reimburse the City for expenses incurred in publication of notices, publication and codification of ordinances, and photocopying of documents arising from the negotiation and adoption of this Franchise Ordinance.

Nothing contained in this section shall limit the Franchisee's indemnification obligation to the City under Section 25 of this ordinance. 
Section 28. - Breach of contract: 
    In the event the Franchisee fails to fulfill a substantial obligation under this ordinance after notice of default and a reasonable period within which to cure said default, the City shall have a breach of contract claim against the Franchisee, in addition to any other remedy provided by law or elsewhere in this Franchise Ordinance. 
Section 29. - Consent of city required: 
    The Franchisee shall not sell, transfer or assign this Franchise or any rights under this Franchise to another, by stock exchange or otherwise, excluding the sale, transfer or assignment to a wholly-owned subsidiary or through corporate merger or reorganization of the Franchisee not involving a third-party, unless the City shall approve in writing of such sale, transfer or assignment of the rights herein created. Approval of the sale, transfer or assignment shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
Section 30. - City's right to purchase or condemn: 
    The right of the City to construct, purchase or condemn any public utility works or ways, and the rights of the Franchisee in connection therewith, as provided by the Colorado Constitution and Colorado statutes, are hereby expressly reserved. 
Section 31. - Negotiated purchase price or condemnation award: 
    Upon the exercise of the City's option to purchase Franchisee's facilities, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine a mutually acceptable purchase price pursuant to C.R.S. § 40-9.5-204. No value shall be given to this Franchise or to public rights-of-way. If the City and the Franchisee cannot reach agreement as to the purchase price or acceptable payment term within one hundred eighty (180) days after commencement of negotiations, the City may commence condemnation proceedings, and each party shall have the rights provided by law relating to condemnation; provided, however, no award shall be made for the value of this Franchise or public rights-of-way. 
Section 32. - Continued cooperation by franchisee: 
    In the event the City exercises its option to purchase or condemn Franchisee's facilities, the Franchisee agrees that it will continue to supply any service it supplies under this ordinance, in whole or in part, at the City's request. The Franchisee's facilities shall be available for continued service until nine (9) months after a final order is entered in a condemnation proceeding or the effective date of a purchase agreement between the parties; provided, however, said obligation to maintain the Franchisee's facilities shall not exceed a twenty-four (24) month period after the termination of this Franchise. The Franchisee shall continue to provide service pursuant to the terms of this ordinance for said twenty-four (24) months until the City has either purchased or condemned the Franchisee's facilities or alternative arrangements have been made to supply electricity to the City and its residents, whichever date shall earlier occur. If Franchisee continues to provide service at the City's request after such purchase or condemnation, no Franchise fees shall be payable to the City and the City shall bear the expense of maintaining and repairing the facilities necessary for the provision of electric service to the City. 
    The Franchisee shall cooperate with the City by making available then existing pertinent records which are not privileged to enable the City to evaluate the feasibility of acquisition by the City of the Franchisee's facilities. The Franchisee shall not be obligated to conduct studies or accrue data without reimbursement by the City, but will make such studies if reimbursed its cost for the same. The Franchisee shall take no action which could inhibit the City's ability to effectively or efficiently use the acquired facilities. At the City's request, the Franchisee shall supply electricity for use by the City in the City-owned system at a rate and pursuant to terms and conditions determined by the parties through good-faith negotiations. 
Section 33. - Limitations on franchisee's removal: 
    If at the time of termination of the Franchise granted under this ordinance no renewal has been negotiated between the City and the Franchisee, the Franchisee shall not be required nor shall it have a right to remove its facilities immediately from the public ways and public places. At the City's request and within a reasonable time not to exceed nine (9) months, the Franchisee shall remove from the public ways and public places, at the Franchisee's expense, all facilities belonging to the Franchisee located above the surface of the ground which are not purchased by the City at the termination of the Franchise.

After said removal all public property shall be restored by the Franchisee to its condition just prior to removal. The Franchisee need not remove any property from said public ways and public places which it shall continue to use and maintain pursuant to contractual arrangements with the City. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith all necessary terms and conditions regarding usage and/or removal of facilities. 
Section 34. - Forfeiture: 
    If the Franchisee fails to perform any of the terms or conditions of this Franchise and such failure is not the result of a condition of force majeure, the City, acting by and through its Council, may determine, after notice to the Franchisee and hearing, that such failure is of a substantial nature. Upon receiving notice of such determination, the Franchisee shall have a reasonable time, not to exceed six (6) months within which to remedy the violations unless the parties otherwise agree in writing. If after such reasonable time, corrective actions have not been successfully taken, the City, acting by and through its Council, shall determine whether any or all of the rights and privileges granted the Franchisee under this Franchise shall be forfeited. Such determination shall be made by the Council after a hearing with notice to the Franchisee and an opportunity to be heard.

    Any such declaration of forfeiture shall be subject to judicial review as provided by law. Nothing herein contained shall limit or restrict any legal rights that the City or the Franchisee may possess arising from any violation of this Franchise. 
    Upon forfeiture, the Franchisee shall continue to provide service to the City and its residents consistent with the obligations set forth in Section 32 of this Franchise Ordinance. If the Franchisee fails to provide such service, it shall be liable for damages to the City and its residents.

    In the event the Franchisee at any time during the term of this Franchise proposes to sell or dispose of any of its real property located within the City or any of Franchisee's facilities, it shall grant to the City the right of first refusal with respect to the purchase of such property. The Franchisee shall obtain a qualified appraisal on any such property and the City shall have sixty (60) days within which to exercise the right of first refusal by giving written notice to the Franchisee. Should the City not provide the required written notice, the Franchisee may proceed to negotiate with others for the sale of such property provided that the Franchisee may not sell such property for an amount less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the appraised value without first providing the City an opportunity to purchase such property at such lesser price, in which event the City must notify the Franchisee in writing within thirty (30) days if it wishes to purchase such property. It is understood that nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Franchisee from transferring real property or facilities to a subsidiary, affiliate, or corporate entity resulting from the merger, consolidation or reorganization of Franchisee, without first according the City the rights referred to above, provided that if the transferee or successor proposes to sell or dispose of such property, it shall not do so without first affording the city such rights. 
Section 36. - Changing conditions: 
    Should the Franchisee, during the term of this Franchise, accept or enter into a franchise with any other Colorado municipality which contains terms, conditions or provisions different from those of this Franchise, the Franchisee shall offer the City such different terms, conditions, or provisions, which may be accepted by the City and become effective and binding upon the parties once submitted to and approved by a vote of the registered electors of the City at the next municipal election. 
Section 37. - Amendment to franchise: 
    At any time during the term of this Franchise, the City through its City Council, or the Franchisee may propose amendments to this Franchise by giving thirty (30) days written notice to the other of the proposed amendment or amendments desired, and both parties thereafter, through their designated representatives, will, within a reasonable time, negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon mutually satisfactory amendments.

Such election shall be at the expense of the respective party proposing such amendments.

Sec. II. - [Authority, responsibilities generally.] 
    The company is hereby authorized, licensed and empowered to do any and all things necessary or appropriate to be done in exercising the aforesaid franchise rights and privileges, provided such exercise does not conflict with water pipes, sewers or other authorized preexisting installations and that all work done in said streets, ways, places and grounds by the company shall be done with diligence and without unnecessary inconvenience to the public or individuals, and the company shall, within a reasonable time, restore all places excavated by it to their original condition as nearly as practicable. 
Sec. III. - [Transferability.] 
    The company shall have the right and privilege of transferring this franchise and all rights and privileges granted herein, and whenever the word "company" appears herein, it shall be construed as including its successors and assigns. 
Sec. IV. - [Franchise fee; books subject to inspection.] 
    The company, for and in consideration of the granting of this franchise and as rentals and compensation for its occupation of and use or easement over, upon and beneath the streets, avenues, easements, alleys, highways, sidewalks, bridges and public places and grounds in the city shall pay to the city each year during all the time this provision shall remain in force and effect a total aggregate sum equal to three and one-half (31/2) percent of the company's gross receipts during such year (exclusive of collections of privilege, sales, use or gross receipts taxes), for gas sold within the city under the company's rates in effect at the time, excepting therefrom, with city's approval however, the gross receipts for gas sold to industrial consumers under special contract and the gross receipts for gas sold to the city for its own use. The company shall make such payments monthly on or before the last day of each month for the preceding month while this provision shall remain in force and effect, each such payment to be based upon its gross receipts during the previous month. For the purpose of determining such gross receipts, the books of the company shall at all times be subject to inspection by duly authorized city representatives.

If the city and the company are unable to agree upon the fair value of the system, such value shall be fixed by three (3) competent, disinterested persons acting as appraisers, one to be appointed by the city, another to be appointed by the company within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of the city's said appointment, and the third to be appointed by the two (2) first selected within thirty (30) days after the company makes its appointment. Should the company fail to appoint its appraiser, or should the two (2) appraisers first selected by the company and the city, respectively, fail to select the third appraiser, within the time provided, then the company's appraiser and the third appraiser or the third appraiser only, as the case may be, shall be appointed upon application of either the city or the company by the person then acting as judge of the United States District Court for the district in which Durango, Colorado, is then located.

The joint determination of said three (3) appraisers as to such fair value, or a majority of them if all are unable to agree, shall be delivered in writing to the city and the company and shall be binding upon each for purposes of this section; provided, that the fair value of the system, and the appraisal thereof, shall in no event be less than the reproduction cost new, less observed depreciation, of the system at that time. 
    After said appraisal shall have been made, the city council shall as soon as may be submit the question of the purchase of the system, at the fair value as fixed by such appraisal, and the plan of acquisition of the system by the city as required by law, to popular vote; and if a majority of the qualified electors of the city shall vote in favor of the purchase of the system at such value and in favor of said plan of acquisition, the city may exercise its right to purchase the system by paying to the company, within ninety (90) days after such election, such fair value in cash, in consideration for which the company shall convey and transfer to the city by proper instruments in writing, and deliver up to the city, all of the system and shall surrender this franchise and any other franchise rights in the city then held by the company. Incident to such transfer the city shall assume and agree to perform all of the company's service obligations and the company shall be relieved therefrom.

It is hereby declared that the public convenience and necessity of the City of Durango, and of its inhabitants, require the operation of the works and business herein authorized and, accordingly, it shall not be necessary for the company to obtain from the city any certificate of public convenience and necessity or other permit or approval, other than that contained in this franchise and ordinance, with respect to the acquisition, construction, maintenance or operation of facilities necessary or appropriate to the natural gas service herein authorized. 
Sec. IX. - [Severability.] 
    If any section, paragraph, subdivision, clause, phrase or provision hereof shall be adjudged unenforceable invalid or unconstitutional, the same shall not affect the validity hereof as a whole, or any part or provision other than the part so decided to be unenforceable, invalid or unconstitutional.

CITY OF DURANGO, COLORADO 
CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS 
INTRODUCTION: 
The City of Durango, Colorado (the "City") has adopted the following Customer Service Standards (the "Standards"). The purpose of the Standards is to establish uniform requirements for the quality of service cable operators are expected to offer their customers in the City. The Standards are subject to change from time to time in accordance with applicable law. 
The City encourages Cable Operators to exceed these standards in their day-to-day operations and as such, understands that Cable Operators may modify their operations in exceeding these standards. 
CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS: 
(a) Cable operators shall comply with, and the City may enforce the customer service standards set forth in 47 CFR Sections 76.309, 1602, 1603 and 1619 as set forth below. To the extent there is a conflict between these standards and the requirements of a cable operator's cable franchise, the terms of the franchise shall control. 
(b) These customer services standards shall take affect ninety (90) days after written notice to any cable operator of the City's intent to enforce the standards. 
(c) A cable operator in the City shall be subject to the following customer service standards: 
(1)  Cable system office hours and telephone availability- 
(i)  The cable operator will maintain a local, toll-free or collect call telephone access line which will be available to its subscribers 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
(A)  Trained company representatives will be available to respond to customer telephone inquiries during normal business hours. 
(B)  After normal business hours, the access line may be answered by a service or an automated response system, including an answering machine. Inquiries received after normal business hours must be responded to by a trained company representative on the next business day. 
(ii)  Under normal operating conditions, telephone answer time by a customer representative, including wait time, shall not exceed thirty (30) seconds when the connection is made. If the call needs to be transferred, transfer time shall not exceed thirty (30) seconds. These standards shall be met no less than ninety (90) percent of the time under normal operating conditions, measured on a quarterly basis. 
(iii)  The operator will not be required to acquire equipment or perform surveys to measure compliance with the telephone answering standards above unless an historical record of complaints indicates a clear failure to comply. 
(iv)  Under normal operating conditions, the customer will receive a busy signal less than three (3) percent of the time. 
(v)  Customer service center and bill payment locations will be open at least during normal business hours and will be conveniently located. 
(2)  Installations, outages and service calls. Under normal operating conditions, each of the following four standards will be met no less than ninety five (95) percent of the time measured on a quarterly basis: 
(i)  Standard installations will be performed within seven (7) business days after an order has been placed. "Standard'" installations are those that are located up to 150 feet from the existing distribution system. 
(ii)  Excluding conditions beyond the control of the operator, the cable operator will begin working on "service interruptions"' promptly and in no event later than 24 hours after the interruption becomes known. The cable operator must begin actions to correct other service problems the next business day after notification of the service problem. 
(iii)  The "appointment window" alternatives for installations, service calls, and other installation activities will be either a specific time or, at maximum, a four-hour time block during normal business hours. (The operator may schedule service calls and other installation activities outside of normal business hours for the express convenience of the customer.) 
(iv)  An operator may not cancel an appointment with a customer after the close of business on the business day prior to the scheduled appointment. 
(v)  If a cable operator representative is running late for an appointment with a customer and will not be able to keep the appointment as scheduled, the customer will be contacted. The appointment will be rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which is convenient for the customer. 
(3)  Communications between cable operators and cable subscribers: 
(i)  Refunds-Refund checks will be issued promptly, but no later than either: 
(A)  The customer's next billing cycle following resolution of the request or thirty (30) days, whichever is earlier, or 
(B)  The return of the equipment supplied by the cable operator if service is terminated. 
(ii)  Credits-Credits for service will be issued no later than the customer's next billing cycle following the determination that a credit is warranted. 
(4)  Definitions- 
(i)  Normal business hours-The term "normal business hours" means those hours during which most similar businesses in the community are open to serve customers. In all cases, "normal business hours" must include some evening hours at least one night per week and/or some weekend hours. 
(ii)  Normal operating conditions-The term "normal operating conditions" means those service conditions which are within the control of the cable operator. Those conditions which are not within the control of the cable operator include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, civil disturbances, power outages, telephone network outages, and severe or unusual weather conditions. Those conditions which are ordinarily within the control of the cable operator include, but are not limited to, special promotions, pay-per-view events, rate increases, regular peak or seasonal demand periods, and maintenance or upgrade of the cable system. 
(iii)  Service interruption-The term "`service interruption" means the loss of picture or sound on one or more cable channels. 
(5)  A cable operator shall provide written information on each of the following areas at the time of installation of service, at least annually to all subscribers, and at any time upon request: 
(i)  Products and services offered; 
(ii)  Prices and options for programming services and conditions of subscription to programming and other services; 
(iii)  Installation and service maintenance policies; 
(iv)  Instructions on how to use the cable service; 
(v)  Channel positions of programming carried on the system; 
(vi)  Billing and complaint procedures, including the address and telephone number of the local franchise authority's cable office; and 
(vii)  Subscribers shall be advised of the procedures for resolution of complaints about the quality of the television signal delivered by the cable system operator, including the address of the responsible officer of the local franchising authority. 
(6)  Customers will be notified of any changes in rates, programming services or channel positions as soon as possible in writing. Notice must be given to subscribers a minimum of thirty (30) days in advance of such changes if the change is within the control of the cable operator. In addition, the cable operator shall notify subscribers 30 days in advance of any significant changes in the other information required by subsection (5) of these standards. 
(7)  In addition to the requirement of subsection (6) regarding advance notification to customers of any changes in rates, programming services or channel positions, cable systems shall give 30 days written notice to both subscribers and the City before implementing any rate or service change. Such notice shall state the precise amount of any rate change and briefly explain in readily understandable fashion the cause of the rate change (e.g., inflation, change in external costs or the addition/deletion of channels). When the change involves the addition or deletion of channels, each channel added or deleted must be separately identified. For purposes of the carriage of digital broadcast signals, the operator need only identify for subscribers, the television signal added and not whether that signal may be multiplexed during certain dayparts. 
(8)  A cable operator shall provide written notice to a subscriber of any increase in the price to be charged for the basic service tier or associated equipment at least 30 days before any proposed increase is effective. The notice should include the name and address of the City. 
(9)  To the extent the operator is required to provide notice of service and rate changes to subscribers, the operator may provide such notice using any reasonable written means at its sole discretion. 
(10)  Notwithstanding any other provision of these standards, a cable operator shall not be required to provide prior notice of any rate change that is the result of a regulatory fee, franchise fee, or any other fee, tax, assessment, or charge of any kind imposed by any Federal agency, State, or the City on the transaction between the operator and the subscriber. 
(11)  Bills must be clear, concise and understandable. Bills must be fully itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic and premium service charges and equipment charges. Bills will also clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates and credits. 
(12)  In case of a billing dispute, the cable operator must respond to a written complaint from a subscriber within 30 days. 
    Section 2. This ordinance shall become effective ten (10) days after its passage and final publication as provided by law.

Sec. 1-1-1-3 Statement of Policy with Respect to Marijuana Uses 
A. Findings. The City Council .nds that: 
1. 
Marijuana is a controlled substance under federal law, and possession of marijuana is prohibited by federal law. 

2. 
The voters of the State of Colorado have approved a constuonal amendment to the State Constuon to allow for persons with "debilitang medical condions" to use medical marijuana. The will of the voters is re.ected in Arcle XVIII, Secon 14 of the Colorado Constuon. That Secon of the Colorado Constuon is further implemented and further regulated by C.R.S. § 12-43.3-101, et seq. 

3. 
The voters of the State of Colorado have approved a constuonal amendment to the State Constuon to legalize, under state law, the personal use of marijuana by persons over the age of 21. However, part of the amendment, re.ected in Arcle XVIII, Secon 16(5)(f) of the Colorado Constuon, provides, "A locality may prohibit the operaon of marijuana culvaon facilies, marijuana product manufacturing facilies, marijuana tesng facilies, or retail marijuana stores through the enactment of an ordinance . . . ." 

4. 
The United States Constuon, in Arcle VI, Debts, Supremacy, Oaths, provides in part, "This Constuon, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaes made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constuon or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. The Senators and Representaves before menoned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all execuve and judicial O.cers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or A.rmaon, to support this Constuon . . . ." 

5. 
Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. § 812. Possession and sale of marijuana is illegal under federal law. (See 21 U.S.C. § 841, et seq.) Violators of U.S. Code are subject to criminal and civil penales under Federal law. 

6. 
The United States Department of Jusce ("U.S. DOJ") issued a memorandum on October 19, 2009 regarding U.S. DOJ policy on enforcement of the Federal Controlled Substances Act in states that allow medical marijuana under state law. In that memorandum, Deputy Aorney General David Ogden writes, in pernent part: 


a. 
"Of course, no State can authorize violaons of federal law 	. . . . Accordingly, in prosecuons under the Controlled Substances Act, federal prosecutors are not expected to charge, prove, or otherwise establish any state law violaons." 

b. 
"This guidance regarding resource allocaon does not 	'legalize' marijuana or provide a legal defense to a violaon of federal law, nor is it intended to create any privileges, bene.ts, or rights, substanve or procedural, enforceable by any individual, party, or witness in any administrave, civil, or criminal maer." 

c. 
"Nor does clear and unambiguous compliance with state law . . . create a legal defense to a violaon of the Controlled Substances Act." 


7. In response to the reallocaon of invesgave and prosecutorial resources of the U.S. DOJ, medical marijuana uses have proliferated in Colorado. 
B. NoMarijuana, medical and otherwise, is a controlled substance under federal law. Therefore, applicants, investors, employees, and others associated with the use are on noce that, among other things: 
1. If the U.S. DOJ chooses a di.erent allocaon of its invesgave and prosecutorial resources: 
a. 
The federal government may be more likely to prosecute those individuals who are found in violaon of the Controlled Substances Act and any other applicable federal criminal laws; 

b. 
Owners of medical marijuana or other marijuana businesses may be subject to penales under federal law, including incarceraon, .nes, and forfeitures, including forfeiture of the building in which the use is located and the contents thereof. 


2. 
Insurance companies could deny coverage, including (among other things) coverage for casualty losses or personal injuries, based on violaons of the Controlled Substances Act. 

3. 
Lenders could, at any me, determine that the use is unlawful and exercise any rights they may have under the terms of the loan, which in some cases may include a demand for immediate repayment of the enre loan balance. 


C. No Right to Conested Rights; No Compensable Rights. 
1. 
Based on the shi in U.S. DOJ policy and the state of Colorado law, this LUDC allows marijuana uses according to the regulatory program authorized under Colorado law. However, while marijuana (medical and otherwise) remains a controlled substance under federal law, no approval pursuant to this LUDC shall be construed to create any enforceable or compensable property right to the establishment or connuaon of a medical marijuana use under any circumstances. 

2. 
No approval by the City shall be construed to introduce liability to the City for any consequenal harms to the applicant or those associated with the proposed medical marijuana use, including but not limited to business owners, investors, employees, land owners, insurance companies, lenders, or paents. 


D. Marijuana Land Uses Prohibited. The City of Durango exercises its right pursuant to Arcle XVIII, Secon 16(5)(f) of the Colorado Constuon and prohibits the operaon of marijuana culvaon facilies and marijuana product manufacturing facilies as de.ned in Arcle XVIII, Secon 16 of the Colorado Constuon. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 1-1-1-4 Purposes with Respect to Sexually-Oriented Businesses 
A. Findings. The City Council .nds that: 
1. Sexually-oriented businesses cause adverse secondary e.ects, which are recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court (in cases such as Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), City of Renton v. PlayTheatres, Inc., 475 
U.S. 41 (1986), FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990)) as impacng substanal governmental interests in health, safety and welfare. 
2. 
In City of Erie v. Paps A.M., 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000), the U.S. Supreme Court held that a city may rely upon cases such as City of Renton v. PlayTheatres, Inc. to provide a su.cient evidenary basis to .nd that a single sexually-oriented business will cause adverse secondary e.ects on a neighborhood. 

3. 
Other cases, such as City of Lileton v. Z.J. Gi, 541 U.S. 774 (2004), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), Essence, Inc. v. City of Federal Heights, 285 F.3d 1272 (10th Cir. 2002), Z.J. GiD-2, L.L.C. v. City of Aurora, 136 F.3d 683 (10th Cir. 1998), OConnor v. City and County of Denver, 894 F. 2d 1210 (10th Cir. 1990), City of Colorado Springs v. 2354 Inc., 896 P.2d 272 (Colo. 1995), 7250 Corp. v. Board of County Comm'rs for Adams County, 799 P. 2d 917 (Colo. 1990), and Marco Lounge, Inc. v. City of Federal Heights, 625 P.2d 982 (Colo. 1981), have upheld reasonable regulaons of sexually-oriented businesses. 

4. 
Other 	communies have studied the negave secondary impacts of sexually-oriented businesses. These communies include, but are not limited, to Adams County, Colorado; Dallas, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Garden Grove, California; Whier, California; Indianapolis, Indiana; St. Paul, Minnesota; Los Angeles, California; Islip, New York; Ellicoville, New York; Las Vegas, Nevada; Rome City, Georgia; Houston, Texas; New York, New York; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Phoenix, Arizona; and Tucson, Arizona. 

5. 
The American Center for Law and Jusce also completed a study on the secondary e.ects of such uses, dated March 1996. 

6. 
Secondary e.ects of sexually-oriented businesses may include any or all of the following, which have a material e.ect on the health, safety, and welfare of City residents: 


a. 
Parcularly when they are located in close proximity to each other, sexually-oriented businesses are indicias of urban blight, which downgrade the quality of life in the adjacent area; 

b. 
Sexually-oriented businesses 	have a deleterious e.ect on both neighboring businesses and surrounding residenal areas, as they are regularly related to an increase in crime and a decrease in property values; 

c. 
Sexually-oriented businesses commonly require special supervision from public safety agencies in order to protect public health, safety and welfare, including that of the patrons of such businesses; 

d. 
Studies and experience show that in the absence of regulaon of sexually-oriented businesses, signi.cant criminal acvity, including prostuon, narcocs and liquor law violaons, have historically and regularly occurred; 

e. 
Sexually-oriented businesses are 	frequently used for unlawful and unhealthful sexual acvies, including prostuon and sexual liaisons of a casual nature, and the concern over sexually transmied diseases, including HIV, is a legimate health concern of the City; 

f. 
Sexually-oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy acvies that are oen uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments; and 

g. 
Children and minors may be harmed by exposure to the secondary e.ects of sexually-oriented businesses, including those encountered when children walk through or visit in the immediate neighborhood of such businesses. 


7. 
The City wishes to minimize and control adverse e.ects and thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of the cizens; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; deter the spread of urban blight; and protect the cizens from increased crime. 

8. 
It is not the intent of this LUDC to suppress any speech protected by the First Amendment, but to enact content-neutral regulaons that address the secondary e.ects of sexually-oriented businesses. To this end, the regulaons in this LUDC that apply speci.cally to sexually-oriented businesses impose restricons which are no greater than necessary to further the Citys substanal interest in prevenng adverse secondary e.ects aributable to such businesses. 


B. Purposes. 
1. 
The purpose of the regulaons in this LUDC that apply speci.cally to sexually-oriented businesses is to set reasonable and uniform regulaons to prevent the deleterious locaon and sing of such businesses, and to ensure that site and building design techniques are used to minimize secondary e.ects, for example, by liming views into areas of a building in which the business is operated. 

2. 
The regulaons have neither the purpose nor the e.ect of imposing a limitaon or restricon on the content of any communicave materials, including sexually-oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor e.ect of the regulaons to restrict or deny access by adults to those sexually-oriented materials that are protected by the First Amendment. 

3. 
This 	LUDC shall not be interpreted to condone or legimize the distribuon of obscene material or other comparable material that is not protected by the First Amendment.

However, if a court of competent jurisdicon .nds any regulaon therein to be based upon content and, further, declares such regulaon unconstuonal, then it is the intent of the City Council that only that poron of the provision that is found to unconstuonally relate to content be severed from this LUDC, and if it is not possible for the court to strike only the poron of the provision that is found to relate to content, then it is the intent of the City Council that all signs that would be subject to the stricken provision will instead be subject to the next surviving provision for a sign of comparable geometry and character that is more restricve than the stricken provision in terms of sign area, and if the sign area is the same, sign height.

Sec. 2-1-2-2 Overlay Zones Established 
A. Generally. The City of Durango has a diverse character and landscape. Overlay zones are created in order to promote the preservaon, reinforcement, and enhancement of key features of the natural and built environments. Some of the overlay zones include subdistricts to address speci.c issues in speci.c areas. 
B. River Corridor Overlay Zone. The River Corridor Overlay Zone ("RCOZ") is established. Its purposes, boundaries, and subdistricts are as provided in this subsecon. 
1. Purpose. The purpose of the RCOZ is to recognize the unique elements of properes near and adjacent to the Animas River, by providing a tailored combinaon of incenves and controls for development and redevelopment of those properes in ways that strengthen the corridor as a community asset and implement the Animas River Corridor Plan. The standards of the RCOZ are based on the following policy principles: 
a. Community Character. Much of the RCOZ is highly visible to residents and visitors to Durango, making the area an important contributor to the character of the community. The RCOZ is intended to enhance the character of the downtown area and the gateway to Durango through: 
1. 
Creave, well-designed, high-quality development; and 

2. 
The preservaon and enhancement of the unique visual characteriscs of the river corridor as viewed from the river and from the land above the river. 


b. 
Economic Development. The RCOZ is an important economic asset to the City for its land use and recreaonal values. Within the RCOZ, the City seeks to promote uses which interest both visitors and the local community, and to provide access to the water's edge. 

c. 
Compact Development and MulTransportaThe RCOZ is intended to promote compact development and redevelopment that includes open spaces, trails, paths, and walkways to facilitate mulmodal transportaon. The RCOZ promotes the mely and orderly development of the City's proposed system of trails 


and paths, and contemplates that uses will be connected to the City's exisng and proposed system of trails and paths. 
d. Ecology. The Animas River is an important ecological resource. In conjuncon with the other requirements of this LUDC, the RCOZ is intended to protect this resource by: 
1. 
Encouraging open spaces and vehicle-free areas; 

2. 
Protecng and preserving vegetaon and natural habitats in the river corridor; 

3. 
Minimizing soil erosion and water polluon from stormwater runo.; and 

4. 
Minimizing disturbance to ecologically sensive .oodplain land. 


e. Flexibility and Performance. The RCOZ is applied to areas with challenging parcel geometry, where compliance with setback and / or o.-street parking requirements may be unusually di.cult. In the alternave to strict numerical setback, bulk, and parking requirements, performance standards are provided to implement the purposes of the RCOZ and the goals of the Animas River Corridor Plan. 
2. 
Boundaries. The o.cial map showing the boundaries of the RCOZ is on .le at the Community Development Department. A general locaon map is provided in the Appendix. 

3. 
Subdistricts. Two subdistricts are created within the RCOZ, as follows: 


a. Downtown Subdistrict. This Subdistrict recognizes the urban character and unique design consideraons of the Central Business District. The o.cial map showing the boundaries of the RCOZ subdistricts is on .le at the Community Development Department. A general locaon map of the Downtown Subdistrict is provided in the Appendix. The Subdistrict includes: 
1. 
All parcels which abut the east bank of the Animas River ranging from the bridge at U.S. Highway 160 to the DSNGRR bridge that crosses the river near East 2nd Avenue; 

2. 
All parcels lying east of the Animas River and west of Camino Del Rio bounded on the north by the Main Avenue bridge located between 15th and 17th Streets and on the south by the bridge at U.S. Highway 160. 

3. 
All land within Schneider Park. 

4. 
All parcels lying west of the Animas River and east of Roosa Avenue bounded on the north by the 9th Street bridge and on the south by the bridge at U.S. Highway 160. 


b. 
River Corridor Subdistrict. This Subdistrict recognizes the less intensive development that exists within the RCOZ that is located north and south of the Downtown Subdistrict. The boundaries of the River Corridor Subdistrict include the remaining area within the RCOZ that is not within the boundaries of the Downtown Subdistrict. 

C. 
Downtown Design Overlay Zone. The downtown design overlay zone is established. Its purposes, boundaries, and subdistricts are as provided in this subsecon. 


1. 
Purpose. The purpose of the Downtown Design Overlay Zone ("DDOZ") is to provide for change and new development, while preserving and protecng the special character and identy of Durango's downtown area. Design standards that are applied within the DDOZ assure that new construcon, renovaon, or rehabilitaon within the Central Business District will be compable with, and will preserve and enhance the district's special character, a poron of which has been recognized as a Naonal Register Historic District. The design standards are based upon the exisng character of downtown as de.ned by the prevailing architecture, building materials, and urban design features. The design standards provide a range of design choices within each of the designated character areas (Main Avenue, Second Avenue, Camino del Rio) and encourage development that is compable and in context with the exisng or appropriate character of the area. The standards discourage the introducon of incompable elements of design or building style. 

2. 
Intent. It is not the intent of the DDOZ to return Durango to a bygone era, nor is it the intent to create an ar.cial atmosphere by incongruous aempts to replicate the past. Buildings teach us the technology and values of the era of their construcon. New buildings are compable in design but represent their own mes (as opposed to imitang buildings from previous eras), and serve as the historic record for future generaons. 

3. 
Subdistricts Established. The DDOZ is comprised of three subdistricts, which represent disnct character areas: 


a. 
The Main Avenue Character Area. The Main Avenue Character Area is the area south of 14th Street between the D&SNGRR right-of-way and the centerline of the alley east of Main Avenue (extended and abandoned), and also includes Buckley Park. 

b. 
The Second Avenue Character Area. The Second Avenue Character Area is the area south of the Animas River between the centerline of the alley east of Main Avenue (extended and abandoned) and the centerline of the alley east of East 2nd Avenue (extended and abandoned), and includes the most southerly property abung the west side of East Third Avenue, but excludes Buckley Park and the Smiley Building. 

c. 
The Camino del Rio Character Area. The Camino del Rio Character Area is the area from the Main Avenue Bridge to the Highway 160 Bridge, between the centerline of the Animas River to the D&SNGRR right-of-way, including the D&SNGRR Train Depot property and the areas north of 14th Street to the centerline of the alley east of Main Avenue (extended and abandoned). 


4. O.cial Map. The o.cial map showing the boundaries of the DDOZ subdistricts is on .le at the Community Development Department. 
D. Historic Districts. The following locally designated historic district is connued: 
1. East Third Avenue Historic District. The East Third Avenue Historic District is comprised of lots that front on East Third Avenue, generally from its Southern terminus just North of U.S. 550 to the Animas River. The o.cial map showing the boundaries of the East Third Avenue Historic District is on .le at the Community Development Department.

Sec. 2-1-2-3 O.cial Zoning Map Adopted 
A. O.cial Zoning Map Adopted. Zoning districts are shown upon the map entled "O.cial Zoning Map of the City of Durango" (referred to hereinaer as "Zoning Map") which is incorporated into and made part of this LUDC by this reference. The Zoning Map is maintained by the Community Development Department. 
B. Force and E.ect. The Zoning Map and all notaons, references, and other informaon shown on it are a part of this LUDC and have the same force and e.ect as the LUDC. 
C. Status of O.cial Zoning Map. The Zoning Map that is on .le at the Community Development Department shall control in the event of a con.ict between the map that is on .le and any other reproducon of said map, including but not limited to, maps that are made available electronically. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 2-1-2-4 Interpretaoning Map 
A. Generally. The precise locaon of any zone boundary line shown on the Zoning Map shall be de.ned by the rules of this Secon. 

B. Rezoning Ordinances. 
1. 
Rezoning ordinances (see Arcle 6-3, Permits and Procedures) shall be promptly re.ected on the zoning map. The boundaries of property that are speci.ed in a rezoning ordinance are controlling, except as provided in this subsecon. 

2. 
Con.icts between the zone boundaries on the zoning map and the zoning for property provided by an adopted rezoning ordinance dated aer the e.ecve date of this LUDC could result from administrave or scrivener's errors. In the event of such con.ict: 


a. 
It is presumed that the adopted rezoning ordinance controls, and the Zoning Map shall be promptly corrected when the con.ict is iden.ed. The Administrator shall provide wrien noce of the correcon to the owners of property that is the subject of a zoning map correcon. 

b. 
The presumpon may be rebued if it is obvious that the error is within the text of the rezoning ordinance, in that: 


1. 
The rezoning a.ects property that was not the subject of the applicaon for rezoning; or 

2. 
The rezoning a.ects only a poron of the property that was the subject of the applicaon, the applicaon requested rezoning for the enre property, and the applicaon was granted without condions that restricted the extent of the rezoning. 

3. 
Any con.ict between the boundaries on the Zoning Map and a development approval granted before the e.ecve date shall be resolved as follows: 


a. 
If the Zoning Map con.icts with a rezoning ordinance adopted before the e.ecve date, the Zoning Map boundaries control. However, if the rezoning ordinance was ed to a site speci.c development plan, then the Zoning Map designaon shall not interfere with any vested rights created by the site speci.c development plan. 

b. 
If the Zoning Map con.icts with an acve planned development ("PD") ordinance that was adopted before the e.ecve date, the PD ordinance controls, unless there is record evidence to show that the Zoning Map was intended to adjust the boundaries of the PD. 

c. 
If the Zoning Map con.icts with an inacve PD ordinance, or with the boundary of a completed PD, then the Zoning Map controls. 

d. 
If the Zoning Map con.icts with a development or annexaon agreement, then the con.ict shall be resolved according to the terms of the agreement. 

C. 
IdenFeatures. In the absence of a rezoning ordinance that speci.es parcel boundaries, where zoning district boundary lines appear to follow iden.able features, their locaon shall be determined by applying the rules of this subsecon in order from 1. to 5.: 


1. 
Rights-of-Way. Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately following, streets, alleys, railroad tracks, or ulity lines shall be construed as following the centerline of the right-of-way. Where the locaon of the actual streets or alleys di.ers from the locaon of corresponding streets or alleys on the Zoning Map, the locaon of the actual streets or alleys controls. 

2. 
Property Lines. Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately following, lot lines or other property lines shown on the Zoning Map shall be construed as following such lines. 

3. 
Toe or Top of Slope. Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately following, the toe or the top of a steep slope, shall be construed as following the contour line of the toe or top of slope. 

4. 
Watercourses. Boundaries shown as following, or approximately following, the centerline of streams or other watercourses shall be construed as following the channel centerline. In the event of a natural change in the locaon of such streams or other watercourses, the zoning district boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline. However, such movement shall not render exisng development nonconforming. See Sec. 6-1­
1-2, Applica. 

5. 
Parallel to Features. Boundaries shown as separated from and parallel, or approximately parallel, to any of the features listed in paragraphs 1. through 4., above, shall be construed to be parallel to such features and at such distances as are shown by the scale on the zoning map. 


D. Un-subdivided Land or No IdenFeature. In the absence of a rezoning ordinance that speci.es parcel boundaries, on un-subdivided land, or where a district boundary follows no iden.able feature, the locaon of district boundaries shall be determined by applying the following rules in sequenal order unl the boundaries are known: 
1. 
Text Dimensions. The boundary shall be located by reference to dimensions shown in text on the zoning map, if any. 

2. 
Map Scale. The boundary shall be located using the map scale appearing on the zoning map. 


E. All Land Within City Limits Shall Be Zoned. It is the intent of the City Council that all land within the City of Durango be zoned. Accordingly, the Rural / Agriculture (RA) zone shall be applied to all land on the zoning map that is: 
1. 
Within the corporate limits of Durango; 

2.

Sec. 2-1-2-5 Zoning of Annexed Land 
A. Generally. Zoning of annexed land or land in the process of annexaon is an inial zoning. The standards and procedures that apply to zoning of annexed land are the same as those applied to a rezoning of property within the City limits. See Sec. 2-1-2-6, Standards for Rezoning. 
B. Timing of Adopof Zoning Ordinance. An ordinance proposing zoning of a parcel or parcels to be annexed shall not be .nally adopted by the City Council before the date of .nal adopon of the annexaon ordinance, but the annexaon ordinance may include the zoning ordinance for the annexed property. 
C. Compliance with State Law. All annexaons to the city shall meet the requirements of Secon 31-12, et seq. C.R.S., shall be consistent with the Durango Comprehensive Plan, and shall be in compliance with Division 6-3-11, Annexaons.

2. 
One or more of the alternaves set out in Subsecon D., below are met. 


B. Resource Protecolicy. 
1. It is the policy of the City not to rezone property in a manner that would create or facilitate the creaon of development rights or entlements that would either: 
a. 
Reduce 	
the level of protecon for signi.cant natural resources that exist on the parcel proposed for development; or 

b. 
Expose addional people or personal property to unmigated natural hazards that are present on the parcel proposed for development (e.g., .re, .ood, or landslide-prone parcels). 


2. This policy may be waived upon a .nding by the City Council that: 
a. 
Alternave means have been implemented to achieve a comparable or beer level of resource protecon (e.g., conservaon easements, paral rezonings, or other comparable condions of rezoning approval); or 

b. 
The policy is outweighed by a substanal community interest that is served by approval of the rezoning (see Subsecon C.1., below). 

C. 
Compa.ts. All applicaons for rezoning shall meet the following criteria: 


1. 
The proposed zone is in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan; 

2. 
The proposed zone will provide a bene.t (or degree of bene.t) to the community or immediate area that cannot be provided in the exisng zone, and which is su.cient to o.set potenal adverse impacts of the proposed zone, if any; 

3. 
The proposed zone would not cause an LI zone to directly abut an EN, RL, or RM Zone, or a CR zone to directly abut an EN or RL zone, unless (in either circumstance) there is su.cient land area on the parcel proposed for rezoning to provide a required standard bu.er, as set out in Secon 4-6-3-5, Zone Boundary Bu.eryards; and 

4. 
Adequate public facilies are available to serve development in the proposed zone; or the proposed zone would limit demands upon public facilies more than the exisng zone; or reasonable assurances are provided that adequate facilies will be made available to serve new development by the me the new development places demands on the facilies. 


D. Alternae Scenario Standards. The City Council may approve an applicaon for rezoning upon any of the following alternave .ndings, which are in addion to its .ndings regarding the criteria of Subsecon C., above: 
1. 
Alterna#1: Plan ImplementaThe City Council .nds that the proposed zone is more appropriate than the exisng zone to implement an adopted, current City plan that was developed with public input (e.g., the Durango Comprehensive Plan). 

2. 
Alterna#2: Change in Character of the Area. The City Council .nds that the proposed zone is more appropriate than the exisng zone because: 


a. 
There has been a change in character or capacity of public infrastructure in the area (e.g., installaon of public facilies, other zone changes, new growth trends, deterioraon, development transions, etc.); and 

b. 
The proposed zone allows for the reasonable development or redevelopment of the parcel proposed for development in a manner that will be compable with its exisng or planned context. 


3. Alterna#3: Need for Zone in Land Inventory. The City Council .nds that the proposed zone is more appropriate than the exisng zone because: 
a. 
There is greater need in the community for land in the proposed zone than the exisng zone; and 

b. 
The proposed zone will promote a balance of land uses in the City that will improve economic opportunity and / or community mobility. 


4. Alterna#4: ExisZone Erroneously Adopted. The City Council .nds that the proposed zone is more appropriate than the exisng zone because: 
a. 
The exisng zoning for the property was erroneously assigned; and 

b. 
Development has not proceeded in reliance on the erroneous zone.

Division 2-1-3 Use / Zone Matrices 
Sec. 2-1-3-1 Interpretaone Matrices 
A. Generally. The tables set out in this Division ("use / zone matrices") describe which land uses are allowed ("A"), allowed if certain condions are met (and in some cases, aer posted noce and comment) ("S"), allowed aer noce and comment if certain condions are met ("L"), allowed aer public hearing if certain condions are met ("C"), and not allowed ("-") in each zoning district. 
B. Legend. The following symbols are used in the matrices in this Division: 
1. 
"A" 	means "allowed." Allowed uses are subject to administrave review for compliance with the general requirements of this LUDC. 

2. 
"S" means "special use." Special uses are subject to administrave review for compliance with speci.c standards that pertain to the use, and for compliance with the general requirements of this LUDC. 

3. 
"L" means "limited use." Limited uses are subject to administrave review for compliance with speci.c standards that pertain to the use, and for compliance with general standards for all limited uses, and the general requirements of this LUDC. Limited uses do not require a public hearing, but have addional noce and public comment requirements compared to special uses. Limited uses are not "as-of-right" uses. 

4. 
"C" means "condional use." Condional uses are subject to public hearing review for compliance with speci.c standards that pertain to the use, general standards for all condional uses, and the general requirements of this LUDC. Condional uses are not "as-of-right" uses. 

5. 
"-" means that the use is not allowed in the speci.ed district. 


C. MulProposed uses that combine more than one listed use, except those that qualify as "mixed-use," shall meet the requirements for each listed use that applies. For example, a fueling or charging staon with a vehicle wash shall comply with the requirements for both uses.

ARTICLE 2-4 DENSITY AND INTENSITY 
Division 2-4-1 Purpose and Applica
Sec. 2-4-1-1 Purpose of Ar
The purpose of this Arcle is to set out the standards for calculang the development yield of parcels proposed for development. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 2-4-1-2 Applica
A. Generally. This Arcle provides standards to calculate the development yield of parcels proposed for development. Individual secons of this Arcle contain applicability provisions which exempt certain development. 
B. Residenvelopment. Division 2-4-2, ResidenDevelopment Yield, sets out the maximum density of residenal development for each zone in which new residenal and predominately residenal mixed-use neighborhoods are allowed. The maximum density in each zone varies based on the amount of open space provided in the development. The Division also describes four types of residenal neighborhoods, and sets out the minimum land area and open space that must be provided for each neighborhood type. Finally, the Division describes how addional density may be realized for the provision of a.ordable and aainable housing units or the construcon of di.erent housing types (See Secon 2-4-2-4, Density Adjustments for Speci.c Housing Types). 
C. Mixed-Use and NonresidenDevelopment. Division 2-4-3, Mixed-Use and NonresidenDevelopment Yield, provides a minimum landscape surface rao for nonresidenal and mixed-use development in each zone, and sets limits on the scale of nonresidenal development in residenal and mixed-use neighborhoods. 
D. LimitaNot all parcels proposed for development will be able to achieve the maximum development yield due to factors such as parcel geometry; physical condions such as slopes, soils, and natural hazards; infrastructure limitaons; or restricons on proposed uses. Accordingly, the applicaon of the other standards of this LUDC may, in some cases, limit the development potenal of a parcel to less than what is provided by this Arcle. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Division 2-4-2 Residenvelopment Yield 
Sec. 2-4-2-1 Residened-Use Neighborhood Types and Minimum Parcel Areas 
A. Generally. New residenal and predominately residenal mixed-use neighborhoods are classi.ed into four di.erent neighborhood types. These neighborhood types are allowed as provided in Table 2-4-2-1, Minimum Area of Parcel Proposed for Development and OSR by Neighborhood Type and Zone. The maximum density for the various neighborhood types is established by applicaon of Secon 2-4-2-2, ResidenDensity, Open Space, and Recreaand Leisure Areas. 
B. Neighborhood Types. For the purposes of this LUDC, there are four residenal and mixed-use neighborhood types: 
1. Typical. A typical residenal neighborhood has one or two housing types, and almost all of the land is owned by individual homeowners (except in the case of mulfamily apartments or condominiums). Common areas are usually related to bu.eryards, recreaon, and drainage areas. (See Figure 2-4-2-1A, IllustraTypical Neighborhood.) The "typical" residenal neighborhood is not limited to single-family detached dwellings. It also includes, by way of illustraon and not limitaon, aached single-family (e.g., townhomes), manufactured home parks, manufactured home subdivisions, and mulfamily development. 
Figure 2-4-2-1A 
Illustrae Typical Neighborhood 


2. Cluster. A cluster neighborhood has one or two housing types, but they are clustered together in order to provide for addional common open spaces. Cluster development may be used to protect natural resources by clustering development away from them. (See Figure 2-4-2-1B, Illustrater Neighborhood.) 
Figure 2-4-2-1B 
Illustrae Cluster Neighborhood 


3. Mixed-Housing Neighborhood. A mixed-housing neighborhood has three or more housing types, and ulizes commonly owned areas as organizing features. (See Figure 2-4-2-1C, Illustraed-Housing Neighborhood.) 
Figure 2-4-2-1C 
Illustrae Mixed-Housing Neighborhood 


4. Tradiighborhood Development. A tradional neighborhood development has three or more housing types which are arranged to provide a convenient and comfortable walk to a mixed-use core area, called the "neighborhood center." The mixed-use or civic core is within 1/4 mile of all dwelling units. (See Figure 2-4-2-1D, IllustraradiNeighborhood Development.)

Illustrae Tradivelopment 

Figure 2-4-2-1D 
Illustrae Tradivelopment 


C. Minimum Area of Parcel Proposed for Development. The minimum area of the parcel proposed for development, and the minimum required common open space for each neighborhood type is as set out in Table 2-4-2-1, Minimum Area of Parcel Proposed for Development and OSR by Neighborhood Type and Zone. The permied density of the neighborhood is calculated according to the standards set out in Secon 2-4-2-2, ResidenDensity, Open Space, and Recrea.

Sec. 2-4-2-2 Residen, Open Space, and Recreae Areas 
A. Generally. 
1. 
The number of dwelling units that may be constructed in a residenal neighborhood or predominately residenal mixed-use neighborhood is based on the zone in which it is proposed, and the amount of open space and recreaon and leisure area that will be provided. 

2. 
Neighborhood types are de.ned by their minimum land area, minimum open space rao (OSR) (see Secon 2-4-2­
1, Residenand Mixed-Use Neighborhood Types and Minimum Parcel Areas), and number of housing types. However, the allowable density of new neighborhoods is calculated according to the standards of this Secon. 


(See Table 2-3-2-2A, Density and Open Space by Zone.) 

3. Once the number of dwelling units is determined, the speci.caons for individual lots or building types shall comply with the requirements of Division 3-2-2, Housing Palee, for the type(s) of housing that will be developed. Building types must be consistent with the type of neighborhood being developed (see Secon 2-4-2-1, Residenand Mixed-Use Neighborhood Types and Minimum Parcel Areas, and any applicable special, limited, or condional use standards for the housing types proposed). 
B. Applicability. The standards of this Secon apply within the RA, RL, RM, RH, MU-N, MU-A, CB, and BP zones as follows: 
1. 
All subdivisions or resubdivisions of property that create at least three buildable residenal lots, or developments with at least three dwelling units on a single parcel proposed for development, shall comply with the standards of this Secon. 

2. 
Developments with three to nine dwelling units may qualify for alternave compliance with the open space requirements and the recreaon, leisure, and landscape area requirements pursuant to Subsecon D., below. 

3. 
Development that is exempt from this Secon due to the number of lots created or the number of dwelling units proposed is subject to the requirements of Division 3-2-2, Housing Palee. 


C. Density and Common Open Space by Zone. The relaonship between maximum density and open space rao (OSR) by zone is set out in Table 2-4-2-2A, Density and Open Space by Zone. The applicaon of the table is illustrated in Figure 2-4-2-2, IllustraApplicaof Density Increments.

D. Alternae Compliance with Common Open Space Requirements. The minimum open space rao (OSR) requirements may be met by preserving an equivalent amount of common open space on private property, if all of the following condions exist: 
1. 
The proposed development has fewer than 10 dwelling units; 

2. 
The plat includes building envelopes and, as appropriate, designated landscape areas, which ensure that: 


a. 
Applicable yard requirements of the housing palee are met (See 	Division 3-2-2, Housing Palee; and, in addion; 

b. 
Development is not allowed in areas that are used to meet the open space requirement. 


3. 
The 	drainage plan shows how drainage will be conveyed within the right-of-way to an o.-site stormwater treatment facility; 

4. 
The allocaon of open space to individual lot or property owners does not materially a.ect wildlife of interest (e.g., if covenants regarding fencing and retaining walls are necessary to protect wildlife of interest, then such covenants shall be provided); 

5. 
Bu.eryards, if required (See 	Division 4-6-3, Bu.ering Requirements), are iden.ed on the plat as landscape easements that must be maintained by the lot owner(s) who are subject to the easement; and 

6. 
Covenants, condions, and restricons: 


a. 
Require the ongoing maintenance of landscape easements (where such easements exist) by the lot owner(s); and 

b. 
The documents shall provide that this maintenance requirement is enforceable by the City and shall not be amended without the consent of the City Council. 

E. 
On-Site Recreaand Leisure Areas. Residenal development shall provide commonly-owned landscaped outdoor areas that are designed for recreaon and leisure acvies as set out in Table 2-4-2-2B, On-Site Recreaisure Areas. 


1. Fee In-Lieu. The City may, at its opon, require a fee in-lieu of land dedicaon under the following circumstances (see Secon 5-2-2-4, Fees-in-Lieu of Park Dedica): 
a. 
If the residenal development does not meet a one acre threshold for providing neighborhood or community parkland; 

b. 
Where the proposed parkland does not meet the standards set out in Subsecon 3, below; 

c. 
When a replat is submied with increased density; or 

d. 
When the City determines that su.cient neighborhood or community park area is already in the public domain in the vicinity (generally within one-half mile or up to one mile if accessible by a trail) of the proposed development, or the potenal for that area would be beer served by expanding or improving an exisng neighborhood or community park or construcng a larger community park suitable for several neighborhoods. 


2. Park Development. 
a. 
There are three types of on-site recreaon and leisure areas displayed in Table 2-4-2-2B, On-Site RecreaLeisure Areas. Generally, if a development includes at least the number of dwelling units set out in the "threshold" column for a parcular type of recreaon and leisure area, then the area is required. If the threshold is not met, either the "minimum conguous area" must be provided or fee in-lieu is required. 

b.

A. Generally. The standards of this Secon apply to established neighborhoods, nonresidenal development, and mixed-use development, except: 
1. 
Tradional neighborhood developments; and 

2. 
The adapve re-use of a residenal building for nonresidenal purposes (in zones in which such re-use is allowed, or required for the use proposed), where the adapve re-use does not involve expanding the footprint of the building or changing its residenal appearance. 


B. Required Landscape Surface Ra(LSR). Required landscape surface raos ("LSRs") for each zone are set out in Table 2-4-3-1, LSR by Zone. The LSR is the minimum poron of the parcel proposed for development that must be allocated to landscaping. However, if the applicaon of Division 2-2-3, Speci.c Standards for Special, Limited, and CondiUses; Arcle 4-4, Natural and Archaeological Resources; and/or Arcle 4-6, Landscaping and Bu.ering, alone or in combinaon, result in a requirement that is greater than the area that is required by this Secon, then the greater requirement applies instead of this Secon.

Sec. 2-4-3-2 Nonresidenale in Residenones 
A. Generally. The purpose of the nonresidenal scale standards is to ensure that nonresidenal buildings that are constructed within residenal zones are scaled such that they do not disrupt the development paern of residenal neighborhoods. 
B. Applicability. These standards apply only in the MU-N, RL, RM, RH, and EN (all sub-districts) zoning districts. Where scale standards are provided in Division 2-2-3, Speci.c Standards for Special, Limited, and CondiUses, such standards supersede the standards of this Secon. 
C. Building Scale. The gross .oor area of nonresidenal buildings shall be limited based on the type of street from which primary access is taken, as provided in Table 2-4-3-2, NonresidenBuilding Scale. These standards do not apply to public schools. 
Table 2-4-3-2 Nonresidenuilding Scale

Collector and Third Avenue between West College Drive and 15th Street 10,000 sf. 
Local or Cul-de-sac 5,000 sf. 

D. Alternae Compliance for Side-Street Access. The maximum nonresidenal gross .oor area for a parcel proposed for development that is bounded by streets of di.erent classi.caon may be based on a higher-order bounding street from which the parcel does not take access, provided that: 
1. 
The street that provides access intersects with the higher-order bounding street; and 

2. 
No residenal front yards are located across the street in the area between the access to the nonresidenal parcel and the higher-order bounding street. See Figure 2-4-3-2, Illustraernae for Side Street Access. 


If the above criteria are met, the gross .oor area of the nonresidenal use shown in Figure 2-4-3-2, Illustrave Alternave Compliance for Side Street Access, is unlimited since it fronts on a major arterial street.

CHAPTER 3 LOTS, BUILDINGS, AND STRUCTURES 
ARTICLE 3-1 ESTABLISHED NEIGHBORHOOD ZONES 
Division 3-1-1 Purpose and Applica
Sec. 3-1-1-1 Purpose of Ar
A. Purpose. The EN (all sub-districts) and EN-MF zones are intended to provide for neighborhood stability while at the same me, allowing for reasonable expansion and new construcon in established residenal neighborhoods. The EN zones are generally characterized by medium and higher density single-family development, and the EN-MF zones are generally characterized by mulfamily residenal development that .ts into the context of surrounding single-family development. The purpose of this Arcle is to set out the standards for development, redevelopment, and building expansions / modi.caons on individual lots in the EN (all sub-districts) and EN-MF zones. 
B. Intent of EN Districts. The intent of the EN (all sub-districts) and EN-MF zones is to protect the quality and character of the City's established neighborhoods through regulaons that limit height, bulk, and in some cases, design and massing, in order to: 
1. 
Assure that buildings are compable in mass and scale with those of buildings seen tradionally in Durango's residenal neighborhoods; 

2. 
Maintain the tradional scale of buildings as seen along the street; 

3. 
Minimize the visual impacts of larger buildings on adjacent properes; 

4. 
Promote access to light and air from adjacent properes; 

5. 
Encourage the preservaon of historically signi.cant buildings and structures; 

6. 
Reduce the visual impacts of impervious surfaces in the front yard setback area; 

7. 
Maintain the percepon of the natural slope and promote stepping of building forms to follow site contours in areas with substanal topographic relief; 

8. 
Reduce the visual impact of cut and .ll; 

9. 
Preserve and enhance the exisng mature tree canopy in front yards; and 

10. 
Encourage design diversity by allowing for approval of alternave approaches to meeng the general standards of this Arcle through alternave compliance review (See Division 3-1-5, Alternae), where appropriate. 


E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 3-1-1-2 Applica
A. Generally. The standards of this Arcle apply within the EN (all sub-districts) and EN-MF zones as indicated in each respecve Secon. 
B. General Standards and Alternae Compliance. This Arcle provides for general standards and alternave compliance standards as follows: 
1. 
General Standards. General standards are the minimum standards that are applied to determine compliance with this LUDC. General standards apply to all development covered by this Arcle, unless the applicant requests processing using an alternave compliance standard. General standards are set out in Division 3-1-3, Design Standards Applicable within MulEN Zones; Division 3-1-2, Bulk and Intensity in EN and EN-MF Zones; and Division 3-1-4, Setback Reduct Increases. 

2. 
AlternaCompliance Standards. Alternave compliance standards are alternave ways to comply with the requirements of this Arcle. Compliance with an alternave compliance standard is equivalent to compliance with a general standard that addresses the same aspect of the proposed development. It is not the intent of the City Council to limit the applicaon of alternave compliance standards to special circumstances, but instead, to make design-based review rounely available to proposed development that does not strictly comply with the general standards of this Arcle. Alternave compliance standards are set out in Division 3-1-5, Alternae.

A. Protecvelopment. 
1. 
Lots within an EN or EN-MF zone that were lawfully created and existed as of the date the lot was designated EN or EN-MF are "conforming" to these regulaons regardless of their dimensions. However, development of lots which are less than 4,000 square feet in area in the EN-1 and EN-2 zones is subject to design review. (See Division 3-1-5, Alternae.) 

2. 
Buildings within an EN or EN-MF zone that were lawfully constructed as of the date the lot was designated EN or EN-MF are "conforming" to these regulaons regardless of their height, building coverage, .oor area rao, or setbacks. 

3. 
Mulfamily and duplex residenal dwelling units within an EN or EN-MF zone that were lawfully constructed as of the date that the lot was designated EN or EN-MF are "conforming" to these regulaons with regard to density. 


B. Restricon Subdivision of Combined Lots. If two or more exisng lots of record are combined for the purposes of development as of the e.ecve date (i.e., an exisng buiding footprint spans two or more lots), they shall not be subsequently split for the purposes of separate development, unless all of the resulng lots meet the applicable minimum requirements for frontage and lot area, which are set out for each zone in Division 3-1-2, Bulk and Intensity in EN and EN-MF Zones. 
C. Required Uand Services. Development within EN or EN-MF zones must be provided with complete urban services and facilies.

Division 3-2-1 Purpose and Applica
Sec. 3-2-1-1 Purpose of Ar
A. Generally. Arcle 2-1, Zones and Land Uses, sets out which uses are allowed in each zone, and Arcle 2-4, Density and Intensity, sets out how much development is allowed on parcels proposed for development within each zone. The purpose of this Arcle is to: 
1. 
Protect and enhance the character of the City by regulang the size, disposion, and massing of buildings. 

2. 
Establish the minimum area and dimensions for lots of various types (for new subdivisions). 


B. Housing Palee. The purpose of Division 3-2-2, Housing Palee, is to set out the types of dwelling units that may be developed in each residenal neighborhood type, and to establish lot and building standards (and in some cases, other applicable standards) for each type of dwelling unit. The housing palee provides a range of choices for lot sizes and housing types so that applicants may design projects that promote a.ordability and diversity, and protect open spaces and natural resources, while achieving a reasonable development potenal on their land. The housing types permied in each zone are set out in Table 2-1-3-3, ResidenTransient Residenand Overnight AccommodaUse/Zone Matrix. The neighborhood types permied in each zone are set out in Table 2-1-3-2, Neighborhood Types. 
C. Nonresidenand Mixed-Use Zones. The purpose of Division 3-2-3, Nonresidenand Mixed-Use Zones, is to establish lot, setback, height, and scale standards for nonresidenal and mixed-use development. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 3-2-1-2 Applica
A. Generally. This Arcle provides lot and building standards (e.g., setbacks, building height, building coverage, etc.) for all zones, but does not apply to residenal uses within the Established Neighborhood ("EN") (all sub-districts) or Established Neighborhood -Mulfamily ("EN-MF") Zones (which are subject to Arcle 3-1, Established Neighborhood Zones). 
B. Housing Palee. The housing palee applies as follows: 
1. 
The residenal development potenal of a parcel proposed for development is calculated according to the standards that are set out in Secon 2-4-2-2, Residennsity, Open Space, and Recreaisure Areas. 

2. 
The types of housing that are allowed in a new development are set out in Secon 2-1-3-3, ResidenTransient Residenand Overnight AccommodaUse / Zone Matrix. Some types of housing are limited to speci.c neighborhood types. The required amount of land and open space for each neighborhood type is set out in Secon 2-4-2-1, Residened-Use Neighborhood Types and Minimum Parcel Areas. 

3. 
Once the dwelling unit count and buildable area of a parcel proposed for development are determined, the housing palee provides basic standards for the creaon of residenal lots, and the basic bulk standards that apply to principal buildings on those lots. The variaons that are permied using the housing palee allow for the .exibility to use a variety of lot sizes and housing types to preserve open space and natural resources without material loss of development potenal. 

4. 
Standards for each type of housing allowed by the housing palee are provided in the Secons of this Division, as are any limitaons on the district or neighborhood development type in which the housing type is allowed. 


C. Nonresidenand Mixed-Use Zones. The lot and building standards for nonresidenal and mixed-use zones are provided in Division 3-2-3, Nonresidenand Mixed-Use Zones. The Division provides general standards, as well as standards that are applicable within Tradional Neighborhood Developments. 
D. Alternae Development Standards. Division 3-2-4, AlternaDevelopment Standards, sets out standards for increasing building height and building coverage, and for reducing setbacks. Applicaon of the alternave development standards avoids the need for variances where strict applicaon of the standards in Division 3-2-3, Nonresidenand Mixed-Use Zones, is impraccal.

Division 3-2-2 Housing Palee 
Sec. 3-2-2-1 Lot Averaging 
A. Generally. Lot averaging is a design technique which replaces a minimum lot area or width with an average lot width and a requirement that certain percentages of lots fall into one of three lot area groups: small lots, average lots, and large lots. See Figure 3-2-2-1A, Lot Averaging. Lot averaging shall be applied as required in Subsecon B., and is oponal in other cases. 
Figure 3-2-2-1A 
Lot Averaging 


B. Applicability. Lot averaging is required as follows: 
1. 
Lot averaging shall be applied to any single housing type when there are more than 20 units of the housing type in a proposed development (e.g., if there are 30 single-family detached units, 25 pao home units, and 20 standard townhome units in a development, then lot averaging must be applied to the single-family detached and pao home units, but is not required for the townhome units). 

2. 
Lot area groups for each housing type are provided in the tables of Division 3-2-2, Housing Palee. 

3. 
Where lot averaging is not required, but the tables of Division 3-2-2, Housing Palee, indicate three lot area groups, the average lot area group shall be used to establish minimum lot area and minimum lot depth for the housing type. 


C. ExcepLot averaging is not required for agricultural, equestrian, and estate lots, as described in Secon 3-2-2-2, Single-Family Detached. 
D. Idenying Lots in Each Group. Lots within each size group are iden.ed by lot width, as follows: 
1. 
Small lots shall meet the minimum lot width for small lots, and their lot width may be up to (but not including) the lot width of the average lot category. 

2. 
Average lots shall meet the minimum lot width for average lots, and their lot width may be up to (but not including) the lot width of the large lot category. 

3. 
Large lots must meet the minimum lot width for large lots, and their width is not limited. 


E. Calculathe Required Number of Lots of Each Lot Area Group. In the tables of Division 3-2-2, Housing Palee, that provide for variable lot sizes, the column tled "percent in width type," indicates the minimum proporon of each lot area group that must be provided. The minimum number of small and average lots shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. The large lot category is always listed as "remainder" because, aer the minimum proporons for small and average lots are met, the remainder of the lots may be large lots. 
F. Distribuof Averaged Lots. Lots in the three lot area groups shall be distributed in at least one of the following ways: 
1. 
Generally, lots in each of the three lot area groups (small lots, average lots, and large lots) shall be mixed on each street segment so that they are spread through the development (except as provided in Subsecon F.2., below). Concentrang lots of a single lot area group in separate areas of a development is not allowed. 

2. 
In the alternave, proposed development that includes a mix of housing types may designate a mix of housing types or diverse single-family detached lot sizes on a single block or street segment. Such developments are not required to strictly comply with Subsecon F.1., above, if it is demonstrated that the overall distribuon of housing types in the development does not unreasonably concentrate small lots.

Sec. 3-2-2-2 Single-Family Detached 
A. Generally. Single-family detached buildings are residences for one family that are typically located on a privately-owned lot, with private yards on each side of the unit. Single-family detached units could also be located on condominium-owned property, surrounded by limited common elements for use by residents of the single-family home, which would serve the same purpose as a private yard.

A. Generally. There are two types of lot-line houses: standard lot-line houses and pao lot-line houses. Both are a single-family detached housing type that di.ers from the typical single-family dwelling unit in that they are situated on the lot such that one side building wall is located on a side lot line and the other side is designed to enclose a large private yard behind the street facade. The standard lot line house has a street-facing garage, while the pao lot-line house has an alley-facing garage and a fenced or walled rear yard (see Figure 3-2-2-5A, Illustraas). 
Figure 3-2-2-5A Illustrae Lot Line Houses 
Standard Lot Line House Pao Lot Line House 

B. Lot and Building Standards. The following standards apply to all variaons of lot-line houses: 
1. 
The interior side setback shall provide for a usable combined side and rear yard; and 

2. 
No window shall be permied on the zero lot line side of the house unless: 


a. 
It opens into an enclosed light court; 

b. 
It is framed at a minimum of six foot four inches above the room .oor so as to not provide a line of sight into the neighboring yard; or 

c. 
It is composed of glass block or frosted glass and is inoperable. 

d. 
The zones where lot line houses are permied are the same as single-family detached, set out in Table 2-1-3­
2, Neighborhood Types, and where the use is allowed is set out in Table 2-1-3-3, ResidenTransient Residenrnight Accommoda/Zone Matrix.

Figure 3-2-2-5B 
Illustrae Lot-Line Setbacks 

The lot-line house is set on one property line with a zero setback, and the building is intended to be roughly L-shaped. The street side setback is the setback that is required on the street side of corner lots. The small side setback is a small side yard along the side of the building towards the front of the lot (see Table 3-2-2-5A, Note 1). The interior side setback creates a larger side yard on the back side of the building, which is useable outdoor space for the residents.

Sec. 3-2-2-6 Duplexes 
A. Generally. There are three types of duplex houses: standard duplexes, pao house duplexes, and over-under duplexes. (See Figure 3-2-2-6, Illustraxes.) 
1. 
In the standard and pao house duplex, the dwelling units are separated by a shared wall with no penetraons, and each unit has a separate outside door. 

2. 
Pao house duplexes, like lot-line pao houses, have alley access and an enclosed rear yard. 

3. 
In the over-under duplex, units are separated by a .oor, and units may be accessed from an interior foyer with a staircase, or units may have separate front doors at street level. Exterior stair access to the principal entrance to the second .oor unit is not allowed.

Sec. 3-2-2-7 Townhouses 
A. Generally. There are three types of townhouses: standard townhouses, weak-link townhouses, and roof-deck townhouses. (See Figure 3-2-2-7, Illustraownhouses.) 
1. 
Standard townhouses are aached to each other in groups of three to eight units by common side walls without penetraons. They are accessed from an alley or parking court. 

2. 
Weak-link townhouses are like standard townhouses, except that they have one-story and two-story elements along the front elevaon, and connect to each other in groups of three to six units. Weak-link townhouses may be accessed from the street or from an alley or parking court. 

3. 
Roof-deck townhouses are like standard townhouses, except that they have an outdoor recreaon and leisure area on the rooop. Roof-deck townhouses are accessed from an alley or parking court.

Sec. 3-2-2-8 Mulx and Mulamily 
A. Generally. Mulplex and mulfamily are both mulple-family building types. The mulplex has many aributes of a townhouse, except that the buildings are constructed to look like large single-family homes, and the units are not necessarily separated by a wall that extends from the foundaon to the roof. The mulfamily housing type is typically in the form of apartments or condominiums of two to .ve stories in height. Mulfamily may also be located in the upper .oors of mixed-use buildings, but those buildings are subject to the standards for nonresidenal and mixed use buildings set out in Division 3-2-3, Nonresidenand Mixed-Use Zones.

Division 3-2-4 Alternae Development Standards 
Sec. 3-2-4-1 Alternae Setbacks 
A. Generally. Alternaves to the setback standards set out in Division 3-2-2, Housing Palee, may be established for a proposed mixed housing neighborhood (see Secon 2-4-2-1, Residenand Mixed-Use Neighborhood Types and Minimum Parcel Areas, and Secon 4-1-3-6, Mixed-Housing Neighborhoods) or tradional neighborhood development ("TND") (see Secon 2-4-2-1, Residenand Mixed-Use Neighborhood Types and Minimum Parcel Areas, and Secon 4-1-3-7, Tradiighborhood Development) pursuant to the standards this Secon. The alternave standards are established using a paern book (see Secon 6-3-6-11, Paern Books) that includes the alternave standards and demonstrates compliance with all of the standards of this Secon. 
B. Modi.caof Required Setbacks. Required setbacks may be modi.ed as provided in this Subsecon upon demonstraon of compliance with all applicable requirements of this Division. Note that modi.caon of setbacks for one housing type may convert it into another housing type (e.g., single-family detached may become zero lot line), and that an alternave to modi.caon may be the selecon of the other housing type from the housing palee (see Division 3-2-2, Housing Palee). Modi.caons shall not be used to allow development of housing types that are not allowed in the zone in which the parcel proposed for development is located. 
1. 
E.ect on Building Coverage. The objecve of this Secon is not to expand the permissible building coverage, but instead, to provide for a range of relaonships between buildings and the street. 

2. 
Front Setbacks. 


a. In a mixed housing neighborhood, front setbacks may be reduced to .ve feet by the Administrator, provided that: 
1. 
They do not allow the building to encroach into a ulity easement; and 

2. 
They are not reduced to less than 20 feet in front of a street-facing garage. 


b. In a TND, front setbacks (or build-to lines) are in the following ranges: 
1. 
Neighborhood Center Subdistrict: 0 feet to 8 feet. 

2. 
Neighborhood Residenal Subdistrict: 0 feet to 15 feet. 

3. 
Edge Residenal Subdistrict: 10 feet or more 


3. Interior Side Setbacks. Where interior side setbacks are required, they may be reduced by the Administrator, provided that: 
a. 
There is no reducon of an interior side setback along a lot line that is also a boundary line of the proposed development; 

b. 
Buildings on both sides of the reduced setback are constructed to applicable building and .re codes based on their proximity to each other; 

c. 
There is su.cient space between the buildings for building maintenance and emergency access; and

B. Modi.caof Lot Width and Area. Division 3-2-2, Housing Palee, provides for variable lot area and width, which is intended to provide visual interest and create neighborhoods where homes can be constructed and purchased at a wider range of price points than neighborhoods that have uniform lot dimensions. As an alternave to strict minimum lot size requirements, density limits and minimum open space requirements prevent the over-development of land. Lot area and width may be modi.ed as follows: 
1. 
Increases in average lot width for a parcular housing type shall be roughly o.set by the inclusion of another housing type in the development that provides for a smaller lot and less .oor area. 

2. 
Increases in the average lot area for a parcular housing type shall be the result of the applicaon of Subsecon B.1., above; or the result of an increase in lot depth that is reasonably necessary to .t the development paern on the parcel proposed for development. 

3. 
Reducons in the average lot width for a parcular housing type shall be permied as follows: 


a. Lots for single-family, aached single-family, and mulplex housing types shall be sized to accommodate on-site parking for each dwelling unit. All lots that are narrower than 40 feet shall be accessed by alleys or parking courts. Tandem parking may only be used to sasfy parking requirements if the City Engineer .nds that: 
1. 
Tra.c volumes are low enough in the area of the parking to prevent signi.cant con.icts; 

2. 
Both spaces in each tandem arrangement are restricted for use by a single dwelling unit; and 

3. 
There is su.cient maneuvering space in the alley to accommodate the tandem parking movements. 


b. 
Lots for mulfamily housing types shall be sized to accommodate on-site parking unless the mulfamily development is located in the neighborhood center of a tradional neighborhood development ("TND") and the building is served by remote parking. 

C. 
LimitaModi.caon of lot width and lot area for one housing type may convert it into another housing type (e.g., single-family detached may become pao house or coage), and that an alternave to modi.caon may be the selecon of the other housing type from the housing palee. Modi.caons shall not be used to allow development of housing types that are not allowed in the zone in which the parcel proposed for development is located.

ARTICLE 3-4 DESIGN STANDARDS 
Division 3-4-1 Purpose and Applicaandards 
Sec. 3-4-1-1 Purpose of Ar
A. The purpose of this Arcle is to provide minimum standards for development design in order to promote dynamic, aracve neighborhoods, and commercial and mixed-use development that furthers the community's goals for high-quality design. Addional design standards may apply in areas of steep slopes or other protected natural resources. See Division 4-4-3, Hillsides, Ridgelines, and Topographic Features. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 3-4-1-2 Applica
A. Generally. The design standards that are set out in this Arcle apply within the City and its planning area to the extent provided for in the intergovernmental agreement with La Plata County. 
B. Downtown Historic District Standards. Division 4-4-2, Downtown Historic District Standards, applies to development or redevelopment in the Downtown Historic Overlay District. 
C. Mulamily Design Standards. Division 3-4-3, Mulamily Design Standards, applies to the development or redevelopment of mulfamily buildings. It includes standards for building and site design. 
D. Commercial and Mixed-Use Design Standards. Division 3-4-4, Commercial and Mixed-Use Design Standards, applies to all nonresidenal and mixed-use development and redevelopment, except within the CB Zone and the Downtown Design Overlay Zone. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Division 3-4-2 Downtown Historic Overlay District Standards 
Sec. 3-4-2-1 Design Guidelines; Findings and Applicability 
A. Generally. The Design Guidelines for the Downtown Overlay District (December 2004), prepared and published by Winter & Company, are adopted by reference. One copy of the Design Guidelines for the Downtown Overlay District is on .le in the Department. It may be inspected during regular business hours. See C.R.S., 31-16-201, et seq. 
B. Findings. The City Council .nds the following with respect to the Design Guidelines for the Downtown Overlay District: 
1. 
The Design Guidelines for the Downtown Overlay District are based upon the exisng character of downtown, as de.ned by the prevailing architecture, building materials, and urban design features. 

2. 
As a "real" town that servers the community and region, Durango must address the expectaons of its residents and business owners, as well as the opportunies and challenges created by an expanding tourism market (and the accompanying expectaons of the out-of-town visitor). Accordingly, the City Council's intent for this Division is to: 


a. 
Provide for change and new development in downtown Durango, while preserving and protecng the special character and identy of the downtown area; and 

b. 
Help protect the downtown economy by providing opons for development in a manner that is acceptable to residents and visitors alike. 


3. A poron of the Downtown Overlay District is also a Naonal Register Historic District. 
C. Applicability. 
1. 
Generally. This Division is implemented through a Cer.cate of Design Compliance. See Secon 3-4-2-3, Cerate of Design Compliance. 

2. 
Geographic Extent of Design Guidelines. The Design Guidelines for the Downtown Overlay District apply to all buildings and uses within the Downtown Design Overlay Zone that is established in Secon 2-1-2-2, Overlay Zones Established, as provided herein. 

3. 
Buildings and Structures. Any improvements, excavaon, or construcon of any principal building or structure, or alteraon, expansion, conversion, or repair of any building or structure shall be in accordance with all applicable provisions of this Division. 

4. 
Signs. The guidelines also apply to requests for new or modi.ed signage for any building or site within the downtown overlay district. See Arcle 3-6, Signs. 


E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 3-4-2-2 Interpreta
A. Generally. The following statements of intent shall be used in the interpretaon of this Division: 
1. 
Durango's 	Design Guidelines for the Downtown Overlay District assure that new construcon, renovaon, or rehabilitaon within the Downtown Design Overlay Zone will be compable with and will preserve and enhance the zone's special character. The guidelines provide a range of design choices within each of the designated character areas (Main Avenue, Second Avenue, Camino del Rio) and encourage development that is compable and in context with the exisng or appropriate character of the area. Conversely, the guidelines discourage the introducon of incompable elements of design or building style. 

2. 
It is not the intent of this Division to return Durango to a bygone era, nor is it the intent to create an ar.cial atmosphere by incongruous aempts to replicate the past. Buildings teach us the technology and values of the era of their construcon. Imitaons muddle the record. New buildings represent our own mes and will serve as the historic record for our children and future generaons. 


B. Development Along Character Area Boundaries. Some projects will be located on the edge of a character area. In these cases, the context may be de.ned by more than one of the character areas. The characteriscs of adjacent character areas will be taken into consideraon in these situaons. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 3-4-2-3 Cerate of Design Compliance 
Cer.cates of design compliance are issued upon a .nding that the proposed improvement, construcon, alteraon, expansion, or conversion is consistent with these guidelines. Review, approval, and the issuance of a cer.cate of design compliance prior to implementaon is required for all improvement, construcon, alteraon, expansion, or conversion within the Downtown Design Overlay Zone. Acvies that require cer.caon of design compliance include, but are not limited to, the following 
1. 
The construcon of a new building or structure; 

2. 
The alteraon or restoraon of any exterior features; 

3.

4. 
Exposed, re.ecve-type bulbs, incandescent lamps, or other illuminang devices which exceed 40 was shall not be used on the exterior surface of any sign so as to expose the face of the bulb, light, or lamp to any public right-of­way or adjacent property. 

5. 
In hanging any sign, any canlever brace or I-beam may be used, provided that the beam extends through the wall and is aached to the wall frame. 

6. 
In guying, a minimum of four guy wires shall be used on any sign, except those using boom hanging or I-beam on canlever construcon, in which case three guy wires may be used. All boom construcon clamps that fasten the sign to the boom shall be le loose in order that the sign may sway. Guy wires shall be stranded and shall be a minimum of three-sixteenths guy cable. All turnbacks or loops of the guy cable shall be served or wrapped to a minimum of four inches. In no case shall cable clamps be used. Any wire over a .re wall, guy wires or otherwise, shall be fastened to a roof member and shall pass over a roof jack at least two inches higher than the .re wall so that no pressure will be exerted on the .re wall. 

7. 
Any transformer used within the building or fastened directly to the building for lighng shall be enclosed in a metal box transformer. All secondary wiring of neon signs shall be of niopremem insulaon, or equivalent, and when used in conjuncon with wood, shall have a minimum of one and one-half inches of air space and shall be placed on glass or porcelain insulators. 

8. 
All parts of any electric, illuminated, or transparent sign shall be of metal or other materials which are not readily combusble.

10. 
Freestanding signs shall be anchored in concrete or similar, equivalent anchoring. 


K. Historic Signs. In recognion of the historic contribuon of some signs to the community, the Design Review Board may consider and grant a variance of standards set forth in this secon. 
1. 
In order to qualify for such variance, the sign shall be at least 30 years old, and the Design Review Board shall .nd that the value of the sign's historic contribuon to the community o.sets the negave impact of the violaon of certain standards set forth in this Secon, and is more in keeping with the objecve of this Secon. 

2. 
The Design Review Board shall use the following criteria to evaluate the value of the sign's historic contribuon: 


a. 
Is the sign an integral architectural feature of the historic building? 

b. 
Does the sign make a signi.cant contribuon to the overall historic character of the building? 

c. 
Does the sign constute a unique contribuon to Durango's historic character? 

d. 
Does the sign represent a signi.cant event or trend in Durango's history?

Sec. 4-1-2-1 Design Objeces 
A. Generally. The design objecves of this Secon are intended to result in plans for development or redevelopment that re.ect high quality design, but not to require a reducon of development potenal to less than is allowed by this LUDC. The principal objecve of this Division is to ensure that roads, lots, landscaping, common open space, and other elements of proposed development are appropriately con.gured. 
B. Applicaof Design Objeces. These objecves are to be applied to new development or redevelopment to the extent that: 
1. 
They do not directly con.ict with the other requirements of this LUDC; 

2. 
They do not result in condions that further reduce the density or intensity of development that is permied on the parcel proposed for development by compliance with the other standards of this LUDC; and 

3. 
They are used in ways that create unique, contextually responsive development. 


C. General Design Objeces. Development in all zones shall result in harmonious, interrelated combinaons of compable buildings and uses that: 
1. Provide appropriate space for bu.ers and transions between: 
a. 
Incompable land uses (see Arcle 4-6, Landscaping and Bu.ering); and 

b. 
Obvious changes in density or intensity along side and rear lot lines; 


2. 
Provide vehicular and pedestrian linkages between residenal uses and recreaonal, instuonal, retail, service, and o.ce uses, with ancipated and planned future linkages to new development; 

3. 
Organize and lay out the development such that it minimizes interference with exisng access to adjacent and nearby properes, unless new and improved access is provided by the proposed development; 

4. 
Minimize impacts to water quality from runo., erosion, or discharge of pollutants; and 

5. 
If there is a discernible development paern in the immediate area of the development: 


a. 
Reinforce that paern, parcularly at the edges where the proposed development is separated from exisng development by a local street; or 

b. 
Implement a redevelopment plan for the area which ancipates a di.erent paern; or 

c. 
Create a strategically located landmark which gives a unique and posive identy to the area in which it is located. 

D. 
Design Objeces Outside of the CB Zone. The following objecves apply within all zones except the CB zone: 


1. Development shall protect and enhance natural and historic resources through:

A. Generally. In general, the layout of residenal cluster neighborhoods shall promote the character of the zone in which they are located, and be designed to protect signi.cant natural, historic, or archaeological resources on the parcel proposed for development, as applicable. 
B. Design Approach. The approach to designing a cluster residenal neighborhood shall follow a four-step process which emphasizes the protecon of natural resources and meaningful open space: 
1. 
First, a site .ngerprint must be developed according to the standards in Arcle 4-4, Natural and Archaeological Resources. 

2. 
Second, building sites shall be located to (in descending order of priority): 


a. 
Minimize the impacts of clearing and grading on riparian areas, steep slopes, wetlands, and woodlands; 

b. 
Protect buildings and sites of historic or archaeological signi.cance or incorporate them through adapve reuse, unless such treatment is inappropriate for protecng the resource; 

c. 
Minimize the visual impact of the cluster subdivision on the landscape; 

d. 
Provide conguity of common open space, resource protecon areas, and, if present, agricultural lands (on-site and, where possible, o.-site); 

e. 
Preserve the open sky backdrop above any ridgelines; and 

f. 
Provide open space and scenic views for the principal buildings in the cluster residenal neighborhood. 


3. 
Third, the road system shall be designed to allow safe and e.cient movement through the subdivision, and to abung property, where appropriate. The road system should avoid impacts to natural resources, and should be designed to enhance views of signi.cant vistas. 

4. 
Fourth, lot lines and lot areas shall be established to provide for the most appropriate conservaon of the open space areas of the development. 


C. Design Standards. 
1. Cluster residenal neighborhoods shall have a de.ned conservaon objecve or combinaon of objecves based on either: 
a. 
Protecng priority 	resources iden.ed on the site .ngerprint (e.g., forest stewardship, water quality preservaon and enhancement, etc.); or 

b. 
Providing a large common open space amenity (e.g., community gardens). 


2. 
Designated resource protecon areas shall be interconnected with other open space areas, greenways, and trail systems (if provided) within the parcel proposed for development and on abung lands where such integraon is praccal and does not materially compromise the resource value of the resource protecon areas. 

3. 
Generally, open spaces shall be integrated into the development design to bring signi.cant open space to the maximum number of properes, as well as visibility from public rights-of-way within the proposed development. However, physical or visual access to open spaces may be limited if such limitaons would materially enhance natural resource management. 

4. 
Streams and watercourses shall be bu.ered by common open spaces that extend at least 50 feet from the ordinary high water mark of the stream or watercourse. In these areas, landscaping shall be designed to enhance the .ltering of surface and subsurface water .ows. Trails may provide access along the greenway unless such locaon would be contrary to resource management objecves. 


D. Lot Standards. 
1. Dwelling units shall be set back from the perimeter of the parcel proposed for development at least the following distances, which are based on the number of lots in the cluster residenal subdivision: 
a. 
1 to 4 lots: as required for individual lots 

b. 
5to20lots:75. 

c. 
20 or more lots: 100 . 


2. 
All lots shall be accessed from an interior road or shared driveway. 

3. 
Lots shall, where appropriate, be adjacent to or around one or more of the following:

B. Complete Streets Policy. It is the intent of the City Council that all new and upgraded or reconstructed streets in the City be designed to be "complete," that is, to accommodate all modes of travel (e.g., motor vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian), for all ages, and for all levels of mobility. 
C. Engineering Standards. It is not the purpose of this Arcle to set out speci.c engineering standards for construcon of infrastructure. Such standards are promulgated by the Engineering Department. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-2-1-2 Applica
A. Generally. The requirements of this Arcle apply to all applicaons for approval of new development, redevelopment, or substanal improvements to buildings or structures on a parcel proposed for development, and to all other development that involves construcon of, reconstrucon of, or substanal repairs to infrastructure that is addressed by this Arcle. If the City .nds that the impact of the proposed development on the abung streets is negligible, then the City may limit the requirement of compliance with this Secon to dedicaon of right-of-way pursuant to Secon 4­
2-2-17, Street Dedicaequirements. 
B. Construcof Improvements. The improvements required by this Arcle shall be constructed by the Applicant throughout the development, including along the frontages of abung streets, at no cost to the City. 
C. Fee-in-Lieu Alternae. For o.-site improvements, the City may require a fee-in-lieu of construcon or installaon of improvements if the applicant's fair share contribuon would result in an impraccal or incomplete improvement (e.g., installaon of a tra.c signal or major street improvements), and therefore, the City .nds that it should be subsumed into a more comprehensive capital improvements project.

B. Complete Streets Design. 
1. 
Streets shall be designed and engineered to be safe and e.cient for all users and all modes of travel (e.g., motor vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, service vehicles, emergency services, and transit, including people with disabilies). 

2. 
The design and layout of streets shall consider the roung of bicycles to and through the proposed development. 

3. 
The 	City may permit o.-street facilies for pedestrians and bicyclists to be substuted for on-street accommodaons, provided that the proposed facilies provide equal or beer access, mobility, and safety for pedestrians and bicyclists. 

4. 
The City may waive speci.c accommodaons within the right-of-way if the City Engineer and the Administrator .nd that, due to the physical locaon of the street (e.g., on a very steep slope in an infrequently traveled locaon), the expected short and long-term bene.ts of the accommodaon will be substanally outweighed by the esmated costs of its implementaon and connuing maintenance. 


C. Street Plans. Streets shall be located and con.gured to implement adopted plans of the City that show the general locaon of new streets. The exact locaon of new streets will be determined during the development review process. 
D. IntegraNew streets shall integrate into the exisng street paern so as to: 
1. 
Address the new development's access and circulaon needs; 

2. 
Provide a paern of streets that facilitates mobility and provides a choice of routes and travel modes, in that: 


a. Exisng and planned streets (including streets that are shown on pending applicaons for 	development approval on abung property) are connued in a similar alignment on the parcel proposed for development and at a comparable right-of-way and pavement width, unless the City Engineer .nds that: 
1. 
There is a demonstrated need to change the street cross-secon in order to improve the safety of the traveling public (all modes), or to provide on-street parking in areas where it is appropriate; 

2. 
The right-of-way or pavement secon of the exisng street is substandard; 

3. 
The 	connuaon would create incompability or materially concentrate through-tra.c in residenal neighborhoods; or 

4. 
Condions of topography or geology make the connuaon of the right-of-way alignment infeasible or undesirable in terms of inial construcon or connuing operaons and maintenance; and 


b. When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lot(s) or parcel(s), such lot(s) or parcel(s) shall be so arranged as to permit the logical locaon and opening of future streets and appropriate resubdivision, with provision for adequate ulity easements and connectors for such resubdivision; and 
3. Facilitate City-wide and regional tra.c movements (where higher-order funconal classi.caons are involved). 
E. Character. New streets shall correspond to and reinforce the community character of the district(s) in which they are constructed. 
F. Natural Resources. Streets shall be located with appropriate regard for topography, creeks, wooded areas, and other natural features that would enhance aracve development, or that are locally or regionally signi.cant for their natural resource value. 
G. URights-of-way shall be su.cient to accommodate underground ulity lines. 
H. Snow Storage. Streets shall be designed to accommodate snow storage in a manner that does not interfere with the use of sidewalks and bicycle lanes. Typically, sidewalks are separated from curbs and the resultant landscape strips are used for snow storage.

Sec. 4-2-4-2 Access Spacing and Corner Clearance 
A. Generally. The minimum spacing requirements of this Secon are measured along the edge of the travel way (including curvature, if present), as follows (see Figure 4-2-4-2A, IllustraAccess Spacing and Corner Clearance Measurements, for illustraon): 
1. 
Spacing between access points (driveways or alleys) on the same side of the street is measured from the closest points of the curb cuts at the edge of the travel way (the curb face or, if no curb is present, the edge of pavement). This type of spacing is shown in Figure 4-2-4-2A, IllustraAccess Spacing and Corner Clearance Measurements, as "spacing, same side." 

2. 
Spacing between access points (driveways or alleys) on opposite sides of the street is measured along the centerline of the street, as the distance between lines that are parallel to the centerline of the access point, which extend from the closest points of the curb cuts to the centerline of the street. This type of spacing is shown in Figure 4-2-4-2A, Illustracess Spacing and Corner Clearance Measurements, as "spacing, opposite side." 

3. 
Spacing between access points (driveways or alleys) and street intersecons is measured from the closest point of the curb cut of the access point to a point on a line extending from the edge of the travel way (the curb face or, if no curb is present, the edge of pavement) of the intersecng street. This type of spacing is shown in Figure 4-2-4­2A, Illustracess Spacing and Corner Clearance Measurements, as "corner clearance." 


Figure 4-2-4-2A 
Illustrae Access Spacing and Corner Clearance Measurements 


B. Access Spacing, Same Side of Street. The minimum access spacing for access points on the same side of the street is set out in Table 4-2-4-2A, Access Spacing, Same Side of Street.

C. Access Spacing, Opposite Sides of Street. In order to prevent con.icng le-turn movements, connecons on opposite sides of arterial and collector streets shall be directly opposite each other or o.set by a distance of at least 75 feet, unless a median or diverter prevents the potenal con.icts. 
D. Corner Clearance. 
1. 
The minimum corner clearance for access points is set out in Table 4-2-4-2B, Minimum Corner Clearance. Figure 4­2-4-2B, Minimum Corner Clearance Illustra, illustrates how to use the table. 

2. 
The distances that are set out in the table are the minimum requirements. Since site and intersecon design must be considered on an individual basis, greater clearance lengths may be required by the City Engineer if necessary to protect public safety. 

3. 
Shared access may be used to meet the requirements of this Subsecon. If the dimensions of an exisng lot and the absence of a reasonable opportunity for shared access make compliance with this Subsecon impraccal, then right-in, right-out access may be permied by the City Engineer at the farthest available point away from the intersecon. For example, a fueling staon that cannot establish shared access with neighboring properes may be permied to have two right-in, right-out access points (one on each frontage), provided that they are located as far away from the intersecon as possible.

Adequate access connecon spacing cannot be achieved, but shared access is established with an abung property. A shared access agreement, approved as to form by the City Aorney, shall be executed and recorded as provided in Secon 4-2-4-5, Cross Access Easements; or 

2. 
No other alternaves exist, and construcon of the access connecon is along the property line farthest from the intersecon or closest access point. To provide reasonable access under these condions, but also the safest operaon, consideraon should be given to designing the driveway connecon to allow only the right-in turning movement or only the right-in/right-out turning movements, if feasible. In such a case, the Applicant shall also demonstrate that: 


a. 
The inability to meet the access spacing requirements was not due to the owner subdividing the property aer the e.ecve date of this LUDC without providing internal access; 

b. 
A reasonable o.er with regard to cross-access was refused by the adjacent landowner; and 

c. 
A covenant acceptable to the Administrator to ensure that the connecon will be provided and access will be consolidated upon the earlier of: 


1. 
Approval for 	development, substanal improvement, or redevelopment of the adjacent property, if providing such connecon is a requirement of the approval; or 

2. 
The Applicant's parcel and the adjacent parcel coming under common ownership. 


C. Increase of Spacing Requirements. The City Engineermay require greater access spacing if the use will generate signi.cant truck tra.c. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-2-4-5 Cross Access Easements 
A. Generally. 
1. 
Access that is shared by adjacent properes, whether under single or separate ownership, requires that an appropriate legal instrument, approved as to form by the City Aorney, to ensure connued shared access be approved by the Administrator and recorded in the o.cial public record at the Applicant's expense. The recorded book and page number shall be referenced on any subsequent subdivision plats of the property. 

2. 
If there is an exisng shared access for which there is no recorded legal documentaon, such documentaon shall be approved as to form by the City Aorney, executed, and recorded. 


B. Terms. The City may require that common and cross access easements include one or more of the following:

7. 
Construcon site operators shall control waste such as, but not limited to, discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, lier, and sanitary waste at the construcon site that may cause adverse impacts to water quality. 

8. 
Concrete washout water shall not be discharged to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) or waters of the state. On-site permanent disposal of concrete washout waste is not authorized by the permit. Discharge to the ground of concrete washout waste that will subsequently be disposed of o.-site is authorized by the permit. See Secon 4-3-1-8 Prohibiormwater Discharges, for more informaon about concrete washout. 

9.

Sec. 4-3-1-6 Best Management Pracs) / Control Measures (CMs) Design Standards 
A. New Development and Redevelopment Stormwater Quality Requirements. New development and redevelopment projects that disturb at least one acre of land, including projects less than one acre that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale or are within the Riverfront Corridor Overlay Zone (RCOZ), must address stormwater runo. quanty and quality through the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs. 
1. 
Criteria for new development and redevelopment planning, water quality protecon, the selecon, and the design of which BMPs / CMs are adequate for speci.c developments shall be determined using the latest revision of the Storm Drainage Design Criteria Manual. BMPs / CMs selected must be designed and implemented according to the Design Criteria Manual speci.caons and following good engineering, hydrologic, and polluon control pracces. 

2. 
Use of manufactured devices, such as stormwater quality vaults, are subject to the approval of the City Engineer and are restricted to the following condions: 


a. 
The paved area served by the device shall be no greater than three acres; 

b. 
There shall be paved access to such devices at a minimum of .ve feet in distance between the pavement and the maintenance hatch to the vault; and 

c. 
Salts, metals, pescides, organic solvents, ferlizers, and other water-soluble materials shall not be stored in areas served by water quality vaults. 


3. Structural BMPs shall be located on private property when possible. 
a. 
When so located, the BMP shall be owned and operated by the owner of the property on which the facility is located. 

b. 
As a condion of approval of the BMP, the owner shall agree to operate and maintain the BMP to its design capacity unless / unl the City shall relieve the property owner of that responsibility in wring. 

c. 
The obligaon to maintain the BMP shall be memorialized on a subdivision plat, annexaon plat, or in another form acceptable to the City Aorney, and shall be recorded in the o.ce of the La Plata County Clerk and 


Recorder. 
d. If the property owner(s) do not successfully complete all required work or violate any requirement of this Secon, the City may take correcve measures and charge the cost of such to the permiee. 
1. 
Such costs shall include the actual cost of any work deemed necessary by the City. 

2. 
If the total of such costs exceeds the security, the permiee shall be responsible for payment of the remaining balance in addion to an administrave fee equal to 10 percent of the actual cost of any work deemed necessary by the City within 30 calendar days of receipt of an accounng of such from the City. 

3. 
The City may place a lien on the property or properes for which the permit covers for failure by the permiee or property owner to provide payment to the City of the remaining balance, in addion to the administrave fee unl such me all outstanding payments to the City have been processed. 

4. 
When the BMP must be located within the public right-of-way or within property owned by the City of Durango, the City shall own, operate, and maintain the facility. The City may take measures to restrict .ows from properes using the BMP and the owner of the property whose .ow is restricted may be required to treat stormwater upon reasonable noce from the City. 


B. BMPs implemented at the site must be adequately designed to provide control for all potenal pollutant sources associated with construcon acvity to prevent polluon or degradaon of the MS4 or waters of the State. 
C. Construcon BMPs / CMs implemented at the site shall be described in the Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP), and shall be updated regularly to accurately re.ect onsite condions. (See Division 5-5-3, Stormwater Management Plans and Stormwater BMPs). 
E.ecve on: 10/30/2018 
Sec. 4-3-1-7 Post-Construct Management Pracs) / Control Measures (CMs) 
A. Generally. Under the post-construcon stormwater management in new development and redevelopment provisions, the MS4 General Permit (CWQCD 2008) requires the permiee to address stormwater runo. from new development and redevelopment that discharge into the MS4. 
B. The permiee must address stormwater quality through the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs designed to prevent or minimize water quality impacts. The selecon, design, and installaon of appropriate structural and nonstructural BMPs must be done in accordance with the latest revision of the Storm Drainage Design Criteria Manual.. 
C. Post-Construcon (Permanent) Stormwater BMPs are generally divided into two categories: Treatment BMPs and Source Control BMPs. 
1. 
Treatment BMPs. Post-Construcon Treatment BMPs include a variety of alternaves generally categorized as conveyance pracces and storage pracces (e.g. a grass swale, retenon pond, or sand .lter) that provide treatment of the stormwater runo. quanty and quality. 

2. 
Source Control BMPs. Proacvely controlling pollutants at their source is fundamental to e.ecve stormwater quality. Typically, it is easier and more cost-e.ecve to prevent stormwater polluon than to remove contaminants once they have entered the storm sewer system or receiving water. A good Source Control BMP is one that is e.ecve at stopping and / or redirecng pollutants prior to entering the storm sewer system. A Source Control BMP can be a structural component of a planned site (e.g. a covered area for material storage) or a procedural BMP. Procedural BMPs depend on behavior change accomplished through public educaon, training, and development of standard operang procedures. 


E.ecve on: 10/30/2018 
Sec. 4-3-1-8 Prohibiormwater Discharges 
A. Except as provided in Subsecons B., C., and D. below, all discharges covered by the permit shall be composed enrely of stormwater associated with construcon acvity. Discharges of material other than stormwater must be addressed in a separate Colorado Discharge Permit System (CDPS) permit issued for that discharge. 
B. Discharges exempt from discharge prohibions (See Arcle VI of 	Chapter 25 of City Municipal Code) that are combined with stormwater discharges associated with construcon acvity may be authorized by the permit, provided that the non-stormwater component of the discharge is iden.ed in the SWMP in accordance with the most recent SWMP guidance document prepared by the Water Quality Control Division (WQCD) of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE). 
C. Discharges to the ground of concrete washout water from washing of tools and concrete mixer chutes may be authorized by the permit, provided that: 
1. 
The source is iden.ed in the SWMP; 

2. 
BMPs are included in the SWMP in accordance with the most recent SWMP guidance document prepared by the WQCD and to prevent polluon of groundwater in violaon of Subsecon A. of Secon 4-3-1-4, Stormwater Quality Permit Requirement; and 

3. 
These discharges do not leave the site as surface runo. to the MS4 or waters of the State. 


D. Discharges to the ground of water from construcon dewatering acvies may be authorized by this permit, provided that; 
1. 
These discharges do not leave the site as surface runo. to the MS4 or to waters of the State; 

2. 
BMPs are included in the SWMP in accordance with the most recent SWMP guidance document prepared by the WQCD; 

3.

Sec. 4-3-2-2 Lighones 
A. Generally. Lighng zones are established in order to provide for lighng standards that are contextually appropriate for the di.erent locaons and funcons within the City. The zones established by this Secon are used throughout this Division. 
B. Establishment of Lighones. The City is divided into .ve lighng zones: 
1. 
LZ0: No Ambient LighThis zone includes areas where the natural environment will be seriously and adversely a.ected by lighng. Impacts include disturbing the biological cycles of .ora and fauna and/or detracng from human enjoyment and appreciaon of the natural environment. Human acvity is subordinate in importance to nature. The vision of human residents and users is adapted to total darkness, and they expect to see lile or no lighng. When not needed, lighng should be exnguished. 

2. 
LZ1: Low Ambient LighThis zone includes areas where lighng might adversely a.ect .ora and fauna or disturb the character of the area. The vision of human residents and users is adapted to low light levels. Lighng may be used for safety, security, and/or convenience, but it is not necessarily uniform or connuous. Aer curfew, most lighng should be exnguished or reduced as acvity levels decline. 

3. 
LZ2: Moderate Ambient Ligh. This zone includes areas of human acvity where the vision of human residents and users is adapted to moderate light levels. Lighng may typically be used for safety, security, and / or convenience, but it is not necessarily uniform or connuous. Aer curfew, lighng may be exnguished or reduced as acvity levels decline. 

4. 
LZ3: Moderately High Ambient LighThis zone includes areas of human acvity where the vision of human residents and users is adapted to moderately high light levels. Lighng is generally desired for safety, security, and / or convenience, and it is oen uniform and / or connuous. Aer curfew, lighng may be exnguished or reduced in most areas as acvity levels decline. 

5. 
LZ4: High Ambient LighThis zone includes areas of human acvity where the vision of human residents and users is adapted to high light levels. Lighng is generally considered necessary for safety, security, and / or convenience, and it is mostly uniform and / or connuous. Aer curfew, lighng may be exnguished or reduced in some areas as acvity levels decline. This zone is very rarely applied. Lighng plans in this zone are approved through a specialty lighng permit as described in Secon 4-3-2-7, Intense and Specialty Ligh. 


C. Applicaones. 
1. In General. Lighng zone boundaries correspond to zoning district boundaries, as set out in Table 4-3-2-2A, Lighones by Zoning District.

Sec. 4-3-2-3 Lumen Allowance 
A. Generally. The total installed inial lamp lumens of all outdoor lighng on a parcel proposed for development or redevelopment shall not exceed the lumen allowance. The inial lamp lumens are typically found on the manufacturer's speci.caons. The lumen allowance is established using any one of the applicable alternave methodologies of this Secon. 
B. Calcula
1. The total installed lumens on a parcel proposed for development is calculated as: 
a. 
The sum of inial lamp lumens for all luminaires tested with relave photometry; plus 

b. 
1.4 mes the sum of the inial lamp lumens for all luminaires tested with absolute photometry. 


2. On parcels where there is exisng lighng that will be retained, such lighng is included in the calculaon of total installed lumens. 
C. Parking Space and Hardscape Methods. The lumen allowance may be calculated by the parking space method or hardscape area method, as set out in Table 4-3-2-3A, Lumen Allowance; Parking Space and Hardscape Methodologies. If a use has 10 or fewer parking spaces, the Applicant may choose which method they would like to use to calculate Total Lumen Allowance. If the use has more than 10 parking spaces, the Hardscape Area Method shall be used. The table does not limit the locaon or direcon of luminaires.

E. Essen
1. 
Essenal access shall be permied only upon demonstraon that there is an area of buildable land on the property that must be accessed across protected resources in order to avoid a situaon of "no capacity" (see Secon 4-4-2­
3, Constrained Site Resource ProtecStandards). The permit shall be denied if di.erent development opons can avoid the need for the essenal access without a loss of density. 

2. 
If several properes in the area have a need for essenal access, then as few essenal access points as possible shall be designed to serve all properes, and access easements shall be provided. If abung property owners do not cooperate, the property owner making the improvements may submit a cer.ed billing on the cost of the access. Subsequent essenal access requests in the area shall be denied. Instead, the property owners shall be required to use the inial access and pay for their share of the documented expenses based on their pro-rata share of the number of dwellings or lots served.

Division 4-4-3 Hillsides, Ridgelines, and Topographic Features 
Sec. 4-4-3-1 Findings, Purpose, and Intent 
A. Findings. 
1. 
Durango's unique natural seng is one of the City's greatest assets, aracng tourists and new residents from across the naon. It is an essenal part of our community's health, character, and identy, providing a multude of economic and recreaon opportunies. Durango's natural environment is primarily de.ned by the mountains, ridges, deep valleys, and slopes in its seng at the edge of the San Juan Mountains. The surrounding hillsides and ridgelines de.ne Durango. These topographical features constute a unique natural resource mering protecon and preservaon. 

2. 
The quality of Durango's lifestyle is aracng new residents in ever greater numbers. Durango's .at areas have, for the most part, been built out, causing hillside development to become more common. 


B. Purpose and Intent. Because these ridgelines and hillsides are key to Durango's identy, these hillside building regulaons are intended to guide and regulate this type of development. This Secon is designed to protect Durango's natural seng by evaluang community context, slope condions, visual impacts, design, grading, and access issues. Protecon of hillside areas is achieved through subdivision design, site design, and structure design standards which are meant to reduce the impact of development on highly visible hillsides. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-4-3-2 Protecelines 
A. Generally. 
1. 
The development standards set out in this Division apply to those porons of parcels or lots proposed for development where slopes of 20 percent or greater are impacted. These standards also apply to .at areas on top of ridgelines or hillcrests that have signi.cant visibility or that may be iden.ed as signi.cant natural features or disncve landforms, as iden.ed in conjuncon with the adopted Parks, Open Space, Trails and Recreaon Master Plan. Secon 4-4-3-2, Streets, Driveways, Parking, and Emergency Vehicle Access on Hillsides, provides special provisions for hillsides that meet this slope threshold that are located within 100-feet from the top of bank of a natural waterway. 

2. 
Any rezoning, subdivision, annexaon, development, planned development, site plan, or building approval or permit shall be subject to compliance with the hillside regulaons, regardless of whether speci.c reference to the hillside regulaons is made in the LUDC secon governing such approval or permit process.

B. Hillside Proteceview Process and Required Submials. 
1. 
The development review and perming process is determined by the slope of the area on which the work is to be done. All proposals or development acvity including grading, modifying, and / or disturbing of slopes of 20 percent or greater require applicaon, review, and approval. An applicaon is also required for all annexaons, rezonings, or subdivisions of properes which have slopes of 20 percent or greater. 

2. 
A completed applicaon must be .led with the Department along with the appropriate fee and all required submial materials. An applicaon is required for all persons desiring to remove signi.cant vegetaon (coniferous trees six feet and taller, deciduous trees four inches in circumference or greater, and stands of gambel oak with 

more than three trees) on slopes of twenty percent or greater. The topography of a parcel is measured using actual ("natural") slope instead of average slope. 

3. 
Required submial materials are kept at the Department in the Hillside Protecon Administrave Manual. 

4. 
A rejecon of the project may be appealed to the Planning Commission in accordance with the procedures set out in Division 6-3-17, Administra. 


C. Landscape Anomalies and Cut Slopes. Under certain condions, the grading standards can be administravely waived due to the existence of landscape anomalies or slopes which were created by a previous excavaon. A landscape anomaly, such as a mound or pit, or cut slope may create a steep slope within an otherwise relavely .at area of land. A small land form may be allowed to be graded, so that a small feature would not render unbuildable an otherwise buildable locaon. 
D. Con.icRequirements. In the event of overlapping or con.icng requirements between the hillside regulaons and other provisions or regulaons under the LUDC, the more restricve provisions shall apply. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-4-3-3 Streets, Driveways, Parking, and Emergency Vehicle Access on Hillsides 
A. Generally. The standards of this Secon apply to the design of streets, driveways, parking, and emergency vehicle access ("vehicular improvements") on hillsides. The limitaons of Subsecon B., below, apply in riparian areas with qualifying slopes. 
B. Riparian Areas. When a hillside is within 100 feet of the top of bank of a natural waterway, streets, driveways, access, and parking shall not be constructed on that hillside except as necessary to provide essenal access or a necessary crossing of a waterway. 
C. Design and Grading. The grading of slopes shall be minimized by aligning vehicular improvements to conform to exisng grades as closely as is possible, and consistent with safe geometric design. Vehicular improvements shall be designed to: 
1. 
Minimize the alteraon of the physical and visual character of the hillside (e.g., large notches in ridgelines should be avoided); and 

2. 
Retain natural landforms by ulizing gentle horizontal and vercal curves in alignments (i.e., alignments on the hillside should be neither wider nor straighter than necessary). 


D. Streets. The City Engineer may allow a proposed street to cross a 30 percent slope only if it is demonstrated that: 
1. The street serves one or more of the following purposes: 
a. 
The street is necessary in order to serve a dwelling unit on an exisng lot of record; 

b. 
The street is shown on the Comprehensive Plan's O.cial Street Classi.caon and / or Future Land Use Map; or 

c. 
The street provides a community bene.t that cannot be provided in a cost-e.ecve and technically feasible manner in an alternave locaon. 


2. The street shall be designed to meet the following objecves: 
a. The street is aligned in a locaon that: 
1. 
Is least disrupve to the steep slope; and 

2. 
Minimizes cut and .ll by following natural contours. 


b. 
Streets and driveways that are necessary to serve dwellings on exisng lots shall limit the amount of grading necessary by designing the dwelling placement and access points where they have the least impact on the hillside. 

c. 
Streets may be split into two, parallel one-way streets (thereby e.ecvely funconing as a two-way street with a land "median") in steeper areas to minimize grading and to blend with the terrain. Culs-de-sac or loop roads are encouraged where necessary to .t the terrain. 

d. 
Modi.ed street standards may be approved by the City Engineer to reduce required grading. 

e. 
Retaining walls shall blend with the natural features of the seng. Use of nave rock or use of other masonry shall convey a scale and texture similar to that of tradional rock or tradional materials found within the natural seng. Limit the height of a retaining wall to less than eight feet. Where greater heights in a retaining 


wall must occur, use a series of terraced or stepped walls. The width of a retaining terrace shall not be less than .ve feet. TheAdministrator may vary the retaining wall height and width requirements depending on site condions. 
f. Screen road cuts and retaining walls with plant materials. 
3. When no retaining wall is to be used, avoid making cuts too steep to accomplish revegetaon of the a.ected hillside. 
E. Curb Cut Width. No curb cut for driveway access shall be greater than 16 feet in width on lots with a width of 50 feet or more. No curb cut for driveway access shall be greater than 12 feet in width on lots with a width less than 50 feet. No curb cut width for a shared driveway shall be greater than 20 feet in width. 
F. Garage LocaGenerally, garages shall not be located in the front of the lot or parcel proposed for development. However, an excepon may be granted by the Administrator where necessary to avoid extensive cut and .ll. In such circumstances, the appearance of the garage doors shall be minimized from street level vantage points. 
G. Driveways. In order to limit the impact of driveways on sloped lands, the following standards apply: 
1. 
Grading of slopes of 30 percent or more in order to construct a driveway shall be allowed only if it is necessary to serve a dwelling unit on an exisng lot of record and there are no feasible alternave locaons for access with lesser slope. 

2. 
Driveways shall generally follow exisng contours. 

3. 
Minimum grading shall occur to accommodate the driveway. Minimizing grading shall be a priority in terms of driveway design and building placement. 

4. 
Non-shared driveways should be narrowed to 12 feet, when feasible. 

5. 
Shared drives shall be a maximum of a 20 foot wide paved driving surface and should be narrowed to a 16 foot wide paved driving surface with two-foot gravel shoulders on each side, when feasible. 

6. 
Shared driveways shall be ulized to minimize hillside cuts whenever feasible. 

7. 
Driveways should take up the grade of the slope rather than cung into or manipulang the topography. 

8. 
Driveway cuts shall be screened with a rock wall, plant materials, and / or other features. 

9. 
Driveways shall be designed to minimize erosion due to drainage. 


E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-4-3-4 U
All ulies shall follow road and driveway corridors where possible. New ulies shall be underground, unless the situaon where burying the lines would require signi.cant blasts to clear masses of outcrops or rock formaons. Alternaves to ulity placement shall be approved by the City Engineer. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-4-3-5 Hillside and Ridgeline Design Standards 
A. Generally. Development acvies that impact slopes of 20 percent or greater shall meet the design objecves set out in this Secon. 
B. Building and Respect for the Natural or Exisopography. 
1. Locae Design Standards. 
a. 
Buildings shall be designed to .t the lot or parcel, rather than substanally modifying the grade of the lot or parcel to .t the building. Buildings, access drives, and lawns shall be designed and con.gured to maintain as much of the natural landform as possible. 

b. 
Where areas of the parcel or lot are already disturbed, the exisng, disturbed areas shall be used for building envelopes rather than undisturbed areas, provided that such areas are of an adequate area and shape and do not pose a geological hazard or other safety issues. 

c. 
Structures should be located to preserve or protect signi.cant natural features of the site, such as landforms, rock outcroppings, mature trees and vegetaon, drainage courses, hilltops, and ridgelines. 

d. 
Locate buildings to balance the following objecves for the opmizaon of the site for outward views: 


1. 
To retain or enhance view from o.-site view points; and 

2. 
To respect privacy, access to light, and safety of neighboring properes. 


2. 
Building Eleva. No single-family, duplex, townhome, or mulplex building elevaon shall appear as more than two and one-half stories in height. 

3. 
Building Heights. No building shall exceed a height to roof ridge of 28 feet for a sloping roof, or parapet height of 16 feet for a .at roof. 

4. 
Building Mass and Scale. 


a. 
Building form shall be planned to enhance the site's natural features (if praccable), and to blend with the natural terrain. 

b. 
The 	mass and scale of buildings shall respect the natural surroundings and unique visual resources by incorporang designs which minimize or migate bulk and mass, follow natural topography, and minimize visual intrusion on the natural landscape. 

c. 
Structures shall be designed to blend into the natural character of the hillside by reducing the visual bulk through landscaping, terraced building forms, appropriate building materials and colors, and height variaons. Split-pad and stepped foundaons shall be used where necessary to minimize cut and .ll, and to create forms that step down or step up with the natural slope to avoid padding and to migate the appearance of building mass. 

d. 
A series of smaller, visually disnct roofs, speci.cally pitched, gabled and hipped roofs, shall be ulized on buildings with a .oor plate that is larger than 2,500 square feet, in order to re.ect the visual diversity of the natural hillsides, except that in the wildland-urban interface, .re-resistant design shall take priority over varied roof forms. 

e. 
Re.ecve materials shall not be used for roo.ng. 

f. 
The maximum overhang for any deck or canlevered building design which extends over a downhill slope is 10 feet. In the wildland-urban interface, overhanging decks and canlevered building elements are not allowed. 


5. Design with Slope. 
a. 
When feasible, locate the principal building on the .at part of the site and o. the slope. Where such locaons are not feasible, foundaon systems, home designs, and driveways shall be used to take up grade. 

b. 
Foundaon corners shall match the natural grade as much as praccable. 

c. 
Buildings that must be constructed on steep slopes shall be designed with stepped foundaons and structures that follow the slope, unless the size of the building does not warrant such design. 


6. Grading. 
a. 
Grading shall be limited to that which is necessary to construct the house, driveway, and a limited area for yard purposes. 

b. 
No site alteraons shall exceed a one-foot elevaon change within one foot of any property line. 

c. 
A grading permit shall be required prior to the commencement of grading acvies on slopes of 20 percent or more. 


7. Retaining Walls. 
a. 
Generally, retaining walls should be used to minimize the impacts of cut and .ll on steep slopes on a site (for example, to ensure the safe development of a lot or parcel, or for the control of stormwater runo. or erosion). Otherwise, retaining walls shall be avoided. Retaining walls are not acceptable when their purpose is to create .at yards. 

b. 
Retaining walls shall blend with the natural features of the seng. Use of nave rock or use of other masonry shall convey a scale and texture similar to that of tradional rock or tradional materials found within the natural seng. Limit the height of a retaining wall to less than eight feet. Where greater heights in a retaining wall must occur, use a series of terraced or stepped walls. The width of a retaining terrace shall not be less than .ve feet. The Administrator may vary the retaining wall height and width requirements depending on site condions. 


8. Ridgeline Setback and Landscape Bu.er. 
a. 
Generally, buildings shall be set back 45 feet from top of slope or ridgeline. 

b. 
A landscape bu.er of at least 0.50 plant units per 1,000 square feet of area between the building and the ridgeline shall be installed and maintained. Exisng, healthy vegetaon shall be counted towards this requirement. (See Secon 4-6-2-2, Plant Units.) 

c. 
Property owners may elect to dedicate a ridgeline easement to protect highly visible and signi.cant ridgelines and views. In the case of a ridgeline easement, the height of any structure shall be not less than 50 vercal feet below the low point of the easement, and the structure must be at least 200 horizontal feet from the nearest edge of the easement. 


1. 
Easements may also be dedicated on hillsides that are not ridgelines. 

2. 
In the area of the ridgeline easement nave vegetaon shall remain undisturbed. 


9. Subdivisions and Developments with Mulple Buildings. 
a. 
Development clusters are encouraged to preserve natural features, reduce grading and impervious surface area, increase usable open space areas, and preserve views of the hillsides. 

b. 
For developments with mulple buildings, buildings should have height variaons in order to minimize a "walled" e.ect or a repeve appearance. Wherever possible, the buildings should be posioned so that they appear to be "tucked" into the hillside and not easily visible from below. 

C. 
Slopes of 30 Percent or More. On slopes of 30 percent or more, the following standards apply in addion to the standards of Subsecon B., above: 


1. 
For new subdivisions, building envelopes shall be created outside of the 30 percent or greater slope areas. In areas in which this is not possible, new lots shall not be created. 

2. 
No construcon acvies 	shall occur outside of the building envelope except approved driveways that are designed according to the standards of Secon 4-4-3-3, Streets, Driveways, Parking, and Emergency Vehicle Access on Hillsides. 

3. 
The standards set out in Subsecons D.1. and D.2., above, shall not be interpreted to preclude development of an exisng lot or parcel with a single-family detached dwelling unit. On exisng lots or parcels that are developed or redeveloped with single-family detached buildings, detached garages or garages below grade are encouraged. Garages that are constructed below grade shall be screened from views from vantage points that are parallel to the contour lines of the hillside where such designs are feasible. 


D. Modi.caof Setbacks. Flexibility in required setbacks may be considered in order to avoid altering steep slope areas. The Administrator may allow the applicaon of alternave setbacks in order to avoid or minimize alteraons to steep slope areas, as follows: 
1. 
Front and side setback requirements may be varied to protect an exisng slope. 	Minimum setbacks shall be established during the preliminary design review. Setback adjustments shall ensure at least 20 feet of spacing between the proposed development and buildings on abung lots. 

2. 
Setbacks along the poron of a lot furthest from a ridgeline may be reduced to minimize encroachment on the skyline. 

3. 
Varied and staggered front building setbacks are encouraged in hillside residenal subdivision layout. 	This is consistent with the natural hillside character and will reduce the visual monotony and "walled" e.ect of repeve setbacks. 

4. 
Setback adjustments shall not create or exacerbate encroachments into Special Flood Hazard Areas.

Sec. 4-4-3-6 Design Standards for Riparian Areas with Qualifying Slopes 
A. Generally. The design standards set out in this Secon are intended to preserve natural topographic features, foster resource preservaon, protect water quality, and minimize degradaon of the visual character of hillsides in riparian areas. The standards in this secon apply when a proposed development acvity will impact hillsides with slopes of 20 percent or greater that are located within 100-feet from the top of bank of a natural waterway. Development proposals within riparian areas shall conform to the design standards in Secon 4-4-3-5, Design Standards, above, as well as, the standards in this Secon. 
B. Limitaon Creaof New Lots. New lots that are less than .ve acres in area shall not be created if the topography of the lot necessitates locang the building envelope on an average slope of 20 percent or greater to the top of bank of a river, creek, or stream, or to the ordinary high water mark of any other waterbody. 
C. Waterfront Setbacks for New Buildings. New buildings shall be set back from the ordinary high water not less than 50 feet, plus 10 feet for each .ve percent of average slope above 20 percent between the building and the top bank or ordinary high water mark. 
D. Rear Setbacks for New Buildings. In riparian areas with qualifying slopes, the rear setback adjustments allowed in Secon 4-4-3-5, Hillside and Ridgeline Design Standards shall be allowed only if a vegetated bu.er of at least 20 feet in width is provided between the principal building and the ordinary high water mark. 
E. Waterfront Setbacks for Exisuildings. 
1. 
Exisng residenal buildings that do not meet the standards set out in Subsecon C., above, shall not be considered "nonconforming," and may be redeveloped or replaced in their exisng footprints. Such buildings may also be expanded landward of their exisng footprints according to the standards of this LUDC. 

2. 
Manufactured homes that do not meet the standards of this Secon may be replaced with other manufactured homes, provided that the new manufactured home is not more than 25 percent larger than the manufactured home it replaced.

This report shall consist of narrave and maps necessary to idenfy wildlife habitat areas, winter ranges, and migraon corridors and describe proposed migaon measures for the protecon of wildlife, their habitats, and migraon corridors (including but not limited to the applicaon of the resource protecon standards in Division 4-4-2, Resource ProtecStandards). This report shall be prepared in consultaon with the Colorado Parks and Wildlife ("CPW") personnel and resources, including documentaon of any CPW recommendaons. 
B. ExcepThe Administrator may waive the requirement of a wildlife report for properes that are located in areas where the existence of habitat, winter range, or migraon corridor is highly unlikely, or where, due to exisng development paerns and / or the size, locaon, and condion of the parcel proposed for development, the proposed development would have a de minimus impact on wildlife. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-4-4-2 Avoidance and Miae Impacts 
A. Generally. Wildlife reports shall include proposed design parameters and management techniques to avoid, minimize, and migate impacts on crical habitat, big game migraon corridors, and big game winter range. 
B. Connec. Crical habitat, big game migraon corridors, and big game winter range that is protected by Division 4­
4-2, Resource Protecandards, shall be selected for its connuing value to wildlife, as follows: 
1. 
Elements of habitat or range that are interdependent shall not be separated in ways that materially compromise the overall habitat. 

2. 
Protected areas of big game migraon corridors and big game winter ranges shall provide a connuous connecon to o.-site big game migraon corridors and big game winter ranges, such that large-scale regional wildlife movements are not impeded by the proposed development. 

3.

Division 4-4-5 River Corridor Overlay Zone (RCOZ) 
Sec. 4-4-5-1 Purpose and Applica
A. Purpose of Division. 
1. 
Views to and from the Animas River are important to the special character of the City of Durango, which increase its aracveness as a place to live, work, play, and visit. The aesthec and ecological qualies of the Animas River are intertwined and provide substanal economic bene.t to Durango. As such, viewsheds and access shall be protected in the River Corridor Overlay Zone (RCOZ) as provided in this Division. 

2. 
The quality of the water in the Animas River is also an important asset to the City of Durango. Water quality is a.ected by the use and development of land near the river. As such, design and development techniques which avoid, minimize, and migate impacts to water quality shall be used according to the provisions of this Division and this LUDC. 

3. 
The performance standards that are set out in this Division are intended to provide .exible ways to achieve the purposes of the RCOZ. (See Secon 2-1-2-2, Overlay Zones Established.) Rather than specifying exactly what must be done in each situaon, the performance standards provide a range of alternaves from which to choose to achieve compliance with this LUDC. This approach allows for maximum .exibility in the design, review, and approval of development within the RCOZ. 


B. Applicaon. The standards of this Division are applied to all land located within the RCOZ as follows: 
1. 
All new development and construcon proposals for land that is located within the boundaries of the RCOZ. 

2. 
Any renovaon or remodeling of exisng structures, if such renovaon or remodeling involves any of the following: 


a. 
A site plan review requirement; 

b. 
An expansion of space devoted to principal uses within a property; or 

c. 
Any change in use of all or any poron of a structure or site to a more intensi.ed use. 


3. 
Subdistrict-speci.c provisions do not apply outside of the named Subdistrict. 

4. 
The standards of Secon 4-4-5-6, Impacts to Riverside Vegeta, and Secon 4-4-5-7, Riverbank Protec, apply to all acvies within the RCOZ, and are not limited to the acvies listed in Subsecons B.1. and B.2., above. 


E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-4-5-2 Viewsheds in the River Corridor Subdistrict (Outside of Downtown Subdistrict) 
A. Viewshed Design Objeces. There are three related design objecves with respect to views: 
1. 
Views from the Animas River to the shore should create the impression of an undeveloped, natural condion along the course of the river. 

2. 
Views across the river from the opposite river bank should create the impression of a sparsely developed condion along the course of the river. 

3. 
Views to the water from trails and paths along the river should not be obstructed by buildings. 


B. General Screening Requirement. 
1. General Landscaping and Screening Requirement. 
a. 
All buildings, except single-family detached and duplex buildings, shall be screened from view from the Animas River by a 50 percent opacity bu.eryard that is preserved and / or planted in an apparently informal, "natural" paern. The bu.eryard shall not include structures, but the screening e.ects of topography may be considered in the evaluaon of the bu.eryard's opacity. (See Division 4-6-3, Bu.ering Requirements.) 

b. 
In general, the landscape bu.er required by Subsecon B.1.a., above, shall include not less than 1.5 plant units per 1,000 sf. of required setback area between the top of bank of the river and the building, excluding areas used for public paths or trails. Planng requirements may be reduced if: 


1. 
The City Arborist .nds that condions are unfavorable to healthy growth of trees; and 

2. 
Other land features provide comparable screening. 


c. Where vegetaon is planted to meet this requirement, it shall be arranged to maximize the screening e.ect for the viewpoint described in Subsecon B.1., above. 
2. Alternaequirement. Landscaping shall be ulized as the principal method of screening buildings. If it is demonstrated that it is not feasible to completely screen a building from views from the Animas River due to topography, parcel size and shape, and the scale and bulk of the proposed development, then in addion to landscape screening, the impact of the encroachment into the viewshed shall be migated using other techniques. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, the following, either separately, or in combinaon: 
a. 
A fence or wall made of natural materials, such as wood or stone, to screen the structure from being seen from the river. When possible, such fence or wall shall be located behind trees and shrubs. 

b. 
Use of muted earthtone colors which are selected to blend in with the natural background (i.e., surrounding plants, soil, and rocks). 

c. 
Avoiding or minimizing the use of re.ecve surfaces on walls, windows, and roofs that are oriented toward the river. 

d. 
Seng the building back from the top bank of the river the maximum feasible distance aer taking into consideraon other essenal site factors such as: 


1. 
Required setbacks from streets and property lines; 

2. 
O.-street parking; 

3. 
Size and shape of the building so that it funcons adequately for its intended use; 

4.

e. 
Orienng large buildings that are larger than 5,000 square feet of gross .oor area (to the extent praccal given the consideraons listed in Subsecon B.2.d., above), so that the visual impact on views from the river are minimized. 

f. 
Modulate building planes to minimize the perceived mass. Appropriate design techniques include varying the primary building planes, alternang architectural elements and materials, and stepping back building stories above the second .oor. 

C. 
Single-Family Detached and Duplex Requirements. 


1. In general, single-family and duplex buildings shall provide a landscape bu.er of not less than 0.75 plant units per 1,000 sf. of required setback area between the top bank of the river and the building. Planng requirements may be reduced if: 
a. 
The City Arborist .nds that condions are unfavorable to healthy growth of trees; or 

b. 
Topographic features provide comparable screening. 


2. If the single-family detached or duplex building is visible from the river or the top of the opposite river bank, then: 
a. 
The use of re.ecve surfaces on walls, windows, and roofs that are oriented towards the river shall be avoided or minimized; 

b. 
Buildings shall use muted earthtone colors that are selected to blend in with the natural background (i.e., surrounding plants, soil, and rocks); and 

c. 
Buildings shall be designed with features which tend to break up the building mass. 

D. 
Signs. Signs or adversing shall not be placed within view from the river or the top bank of the river, except for pedestrian-oriented signs that the City may install along paths and trails. 

E. 
Trail or Path Setbacks. New buildings and expansions of exisng buildings shall be set back at least 25 feet from exisng or proposed trails and paths.

Sec. 4-4-5-6 Impacts to Riverside Vegeta
A. Generally. 
1. Vegetaon is a mulfunconal asset within the River Corridor Overlay Zone (RCOZ). 	Vegetaon has inherent aesthec qualies and it screens development from view in many areas. Vegetaon is also vital to maintain and preserve the natural ecology of the river corridor: 
a. 
It provides habitat (and crical habitat) for a variety of species; 

b. 
It provides food and moderates water temperatures for aquac species; and 

c. 
It helps to maintain water quality and enhance bank stability by: 


1. 
Acng as a .lter to prevent pollutants in runo. from reaching the river; and 

2. 
Providing fricon to slow .ood .ows and prevent erosion. 


2. 
Careful site planning shall consider site erosion, riverbank stability, soil types, and discharge. 

3. 
Vegetaon within the river corridor consists of three basic types: 


a. 
Wetland species; 

b. 
Riparian species; and 

c. 
Upland species. 

B. 
General Performance Standard for Wetland and Riparian Vegetan. Wetland and riparian vegetaon shall not be disturbed during development. 

C. 
Alternae Performance Standard for Wetland and Riparian Vegeta


1. 
For parcels containing single-family and duplex residences, riparian vegetaon may be selecvely removed or pruned to provide a view to the river from the residence, provided that the applicable planng density standards in Secon 4-4-5-2, Viewsheds in the River Corridor Subdistrict (outside of the Downtown Subdistrict), are met. The extent of removal or alteraon of riparian vegetaon for such parcels shall be reviewed and approved by the Department. 

2. 
For parcels that are not subject to Subsecon C.1., above, in circumstances where the general standard cannot be met (e.g., the need for river access, trail locaon, or the enre parcel is located within the riparian corridor), disturbance of wetland and riparian vegetaon shall be minimized as follows: 


a. 
Areas that will be disturbed during construcon acvies shall be delineated on a site plan (general vegetaon maps on .le at the Department may be referred to). The site plan shall show how the development minimizes impacts to wetland and riparian vegetaon. 

b. 
Prior 	to removal or alteraon of riparian vegetaon, impacts of such removal or alteraon shall be documented, and any other required permits (e.g., Army Corps of Engineers) shall be obtained. Impacts shall be migated using the techniques in Subsecon C.3., below 


3. Migaon techniques may include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: 
a. 
Where 	vegetaon is disturbed during construcon, idencal or similar vegetaon should be promptly replanted. Non-nave or invasive vegetaon must be replaced with nave species. 

b. 
Where opportunies exist to enhance riparian vegetaon, including removal of non-nave or invasive species, new planngs are encouraged. 


4. Disturbance of wetlands may be subject to review by other jurisdicons, such as the Army Corps of Engineers. 
D. General Standard for Disturbance of Upland VegetaDisturbance of upland vegetaon should be minimized. 
E. Mature VegetaThe removal of mature vegetaon (except invasive exoc species) is discouraged. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-4-5-7 Riverbank Protec
A. Generally. There shall be no alteraon of the riverbank except as necessary to eliminate an exisng hazard or to clean up or restore the riverbank. Prior to any such alteraon, a permit shall be obtained from the Department and any other agency having jurisdicon (e.g., Army Corps of Engineers). 
B. Dumping. The dumping into the river of any debris, dirt, .ll, vegetaon, street snow, or other material is strictly prohibited. Stormwater runo. and snow melt are not considered "dumping," but may be subject to other standards of this LUDC, as well as State and Federal law.

Division 4-4-6 Floodplain Management and Flood Damage Preven
Sec. 4-4-6-1 Flood Hazard Areas; Statutory Authoriza
The Legislature of the State of Colorado has, in Arcle 23 of Title 31 C.R.S., delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulaons designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its cizenry. Therefore, the City Council has adopted the regulaons, standards, and procedures of this Division. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-4-6-2 Flood Hazard Areas; Findings of Fact 
A. The City Council .nds the following facts: 
1. 
The .ood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundaon, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disrupon of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for .ood protecon and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely a.ect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 

2. 
These .ood losses are caused by the cumulave e.ect of obstrucons in areas of special .ood hazards, which increase .ood heights and velocies, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately .ood-proofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from .ood damage also contribute to .ood loss. 


E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-4-6-3 Statement of Purpose 
A. It is the purpose of this Division to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to .ood condions in speci.c areas by provisions designed to: 
1. 
Protect human life and health; 

2. 
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly .ood control projects; 

3. 
Minimize the need for rescue and relief e.orts associated with .ooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 

4. 
Minimize prolonged business interrupons; 

5. 
Minimize damage to public facilies and ulies such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in areas of special .ood hazard; 

6. 
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special .ood hazard so as to minimize future blight areas; 

7. 
Ensure that potenal buyers are no.ed that property is in an area of special .ood hazard; and 

8. 
Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special .ood hazard assume responsibility for their acons. 


E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-4-6-4 Applica
A. Generally. This Division shall apply to all areas of special .ood hazards within the jurisdicon of the City as re.ected on the .ood insurance rate map, and areas removed from the .oodplain by issuance of a FEMA Leer of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F), which are on .le at the Department of Community Development ("Department"). 
B. Establishment of Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special .ood hazard iden.ed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in a scien.c and engineering report entled "Flood Insurance Study for La Plata County, Colorado and Incorporated Areas", dated August 19, 2010, with accompanying .ood insurance rate maps ("FIRM"), and any revisions thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this LUDC. The .ood insurance study and FIRM are on .le and may be reviewed at the o.ces of the Department. 
C. Compliance. No structure within an area of special .ood hazard shall hereaer be constructed, located, extended, or converted, nor shall any structure or land within an area of special .ood hazard be altered, without full compliance with the terms of this Division and other applicable regulaons. 
D. Abrogaand Greater RestricThis Division is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any exisng easements, covenants, or deed restricons; however, where this Division and other ordinances, easements, covenants, or deed restricons con.ict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restricons shall prevail. 
E. InterpretaIn the interpretaon and applicaon of this Division, all provisions shall be: 
1. 
Considered as minimum requirements; 

2. 
Liberally construed in favor of the City; and

The WUI creates a potenally dangerous situaon for .ames or embers from a wildland .re to come in contact with structures. The purpose of this Secon is to provide a means to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by establishing standards for development within a WUI area in order to: 
1. 
Reduce threats to life safety, property, and resources by improving development and construcon standards, access to and defensibility of developments, homes, and other property in WUI areas; 

2. 
Minimize the potenal of spreading .re from wildland areas to structures and from structure .res to wildland areas; 

3. 
Idenfy the 	appropriate use of cul-de-sacs, hammer head turnarounds, and turnouts on streets and roads providing legal and physical access to subdivisions with the intent to provide beer emergency access to remote areas; and 

4. 
Require homeowners and neighborhoods to plan, create, and maintain defensible space that ulizes .re resistant construcon and landscaping. 


B. Wild.re MiaPlan Required. Proposed development that is located in the WUI shall provide and implement a wild.re hazard migaon plan according the standards of Appendix C, Wild.re Mie.

A. Generally. The purpose of this Arcle is to ensure that: 
1. 
Adequate o.-street motor vehicle and bicycle parking is provided for uses that are permied by this LUDC; 

2. 
Su.cient motor vehicle parking is provided in nonresidenal areas that are near residenal neighborhoods, so that the character and quality of life in the residenal neighborhoods are protected from excessive over.ow parking; 

3. 
The sharing of o.-street parking spaces among uses that have di.erent peak parking demands allows for a reducon in the number of parking spaces that are required to serve mixed-use development; 

4. 
Adequate loading areas and (where appropriate) stacking areas are provided that do not interfere with the funcon of adjacent streets and on-site vehicular use areas; and 

5. 
Sites that are used for in.ll, adapve re-use, or redevelopment have .exibility and mulple alternaves for compliance with this Arcle, such that investments in upgrades to real property are promoted. 


B. Parking Districts. This Arcle establishes parking districts in which di.erent parking requirements apply. These districts are created in recognion of the fact that certain areas of the City generate more automobile trips than other areas, and therefore, have di.erent parking demands. 
C. Parking ReducIn addion to establishing parking requirements that provide for convenience, neighborhood protecon, and mobility, this Arcle provides several ways to reduce the number of parking spaces that are required for development, in order to promote the e.cient use of land and reduce the expanse of paved areas. 
D. Residents and Visitors with Disabili. This Arcle ensures that appropriate parking areas and accessible routes will be provided for disabled persons when parking lots or structures are developed, expanded, or recon.gured. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014

Division 4-5-2 Parking and Loading Calcula
Sec. 4-5-2-1 Calculaequired Parking Spaces 
A. Generally. Secon 4-5-2-2, Required O.-Street Parking Spaces (Parking Tables), sets out the number of parking spaces that are required for each land use that is listed in Division 2-1-3, Use / Zone Matrices. The number of parking spaces is based on one or more independent variables, which are measured as provided in this Secon. 
B. Independent Variables. The independent variables for parking calculaons are measured as follows: 
1. 
Per sf. GFA. The phrase "per sf. GFA" means that the number of parking spaces is calculated based on the number of square feet of gross .oor area put to the use, as calculated using the methodology in Secon 7-2-1-2, Gross Floor Area, as it relates to "gross .oor area (parking)." 

2. 
Per sf. GLA. The phrase "per sf. GLA" means that the number of parking spaces is calculated based on the number of gross square feet of leasable .oor area put to the use, as calculated using the methodology in Secon 7-2-1-2, Gross Floor Area, as it relates to "gross leasable area (parking)." 

3. 
Per dwelling unit or per BR. The phrase "per dwelling unit" means that the number of parking spaces is calculated based on the number of dwelling units. In some cases, the parking requirements are based on the number of bedrooms (per "#" BR unit) in the dwelling units. 

4. 
Per Bed. The phrase "per bed" means that the number of parking spaces is based on the number of beds in the facility instead of the number of sleeping rooms or some other measure. Per bed calculaons are normally applied to uses that o.er residenal care or overnight accommodaons with shared rooms. 

5. 
Per Employee. The phrase "per employee" means that the number of parking spaces is based on the number of employees (full-me and part-me equivalent) on the maximum shi, that is, the work shi in which the maximum number of employees are present. 

6. 
Per Seat / Per Seat Design Capacity. The phrase "per seat" means that the number of parking spaces is based on the number of seats that are provided to guests (patrons, members, etc.); and the phrase "per seat design capacity" means that the number of parking spaces is based on the maximum seang capacity of the use as determined by applicable .re codes. 

7. 
Per Person Design Capacity. The phrase "per person design capacity" means that the number of parking spaces is based on the maximum number of people who may occupy the use pursuant to applicable .re code standards. 

8. 
Others. Other independent variables are measured according to their common meanings. 


C. Rounding. When the calculaon of required parking spaces results in a fraconal parking space, the result of the parking calculaon shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. 
D. Parking ReducGenerally, the total number of required parking spaces is equal to the sum of the required parking for each use of a parcel proposed for development. However, parking requirements may be reduced according to the methodology of Secon 4-5-2-9, Shared Parking, and the provisions of Secon 4-5-2-6, Parking Credits and ReducGeneral. Secon 4-5-2-6, Parking Credits and ReducGeneral, sets out the order of the reducons if shared parking and parking credits are both used. 
E. Calculavenue Character Area of Downtown Design Overlay Zone.

Sec. 4-5-2-5 Special Studies 
A. Generally. 
1. 
Some of the uses that are listed in the tables set out in Secon 4-5-2-2, Required O.-Street Parking Spaces (Parking Tables), have nonlinear or widely varying parking demand characteriscs. Accordingly, their parking requirements are listed in the table as "special study." Required parking for these uses shall be established according to the standards of this Secon. 

2. 
Special studies may also be submied to support a request to reduce the number of required parking spaces to less than that set out in Secon 4-5-2-2, Required O.-Street Parking Spaces (Parking Tables), due to the nature of the operaons and / or locaon of a proposed use. Such special studies shall include and support all requested reducons in parking. Further parking credits and reducons that are otherwise available pursuant to Secon 4-5­
2-6, Parking Credits and ReducGeneral, and Secon 4-5-2-9, Shared Parking, shall not be applied when parking reducons are granted pursuant to this Secon, unless such reducons are supported by the special study. 


B. Special Study Requirements. 
1. 
A special study shall be conducted by a quali.ed transportaon planner or tra.c engineer at the Applicant's expense. The Administrator shall develop and maintain a list of quali.caons and / or cer.caons that are acceptable to the City for this purpose. 

2. 
The special study shall provide: 


a. 
A peak parking analysis of at least .ve funconally comparable uses. 

b. 
Documentaon regarding the comparability of the referenced uses, including: name, funcon, locaon, gross .oor area, parking availability, access to transportaon network (including vehicular, bicycle, pedestrian, and transit), use restricons, and other factors that could a.ect the parking demand. 

C. 
Abbreviated Special Study Requirements. The analycal requirements set out in Subsecon B., above, may be reduced to two funconally comparable uses if: 


1. 
The uses are located in the City or within .ve miles of its corporate limits; 

2. 
The use has less than 5,000 square feet of gross .oor area; or 

3. 
The special study is used to jusfy a reducon in required parking and the requested reducon is 15 percent or less. 


D. Approval of Special Study. 
1. 
The City may rely upon the special study or may request addional informaon or analysis, including, but not limited to: alternave or new data points, or consideraon of addional or alternave factors related to comparability or peak demand, as supported by sound engineering principles. 

2. 
As a condion of approval of a special study, the City may require that land be reserved or land-banked for addional parking if there is a demonstrably high probability the use could change, resulng in a higher demand for parking. 


E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-5-2-6 Parking Credits and Reducal 
A. Generally. This Secon sets out several ways to reduce the number of o.-street parking spaces that must be provided, as set out in Secon 4-5-2-2, Required O.-Street Parking Spaces (Parking Tables). If used in conjuncon with shared parking (see Secon 4-5-2-9, Shared Parking), these reducons may be applied to one type of use to reduce the parking requirement for the use prior to calculang the shared parking reducon. The credits and reducons set out in this Secon are not available to uses that base their parking on a special study (see Secon 4-5-2-5, Special Studies), unless the special study's methodology speci.cally addresses these credits and reducons and determines that they are appropriate. 
B. On-Street Parking Credits. In approved mixed-use developments that provide new on-street parking along internal streets, on-street parking may be credited to parcular uses in accordance with the formula: Parking Credit = (Sa x P), where: 
1. 
Sa = the area of the Applicant's parcel divided by the area of the mixed-use development; and 

2. 
P = the total parking that is available on-street in the mixed-use development. 


C. Replacement of O.-Street Parking Spaces with Bicycle Parking Spaces. Any nonresidenal development in any zone may convert or substute up to .ve percent of the required o.-street automobile parking spaces (to a maximum of .ve automobile parking spaces) into addional bicycle parking spaces (not already required by the LUDC) at the following raos: 
1. 
One automobile parking space for every six covered bicycle spaces (including spaces within covered bicycle cages); and 

2. 
One automobile parking space for every two bicycle lockers. 


D. Reducof Parking Requirements by RestricOccupancy Numbers. The o.-street parking requirements for mulfamily dwelling units may be reduced if the Applicant restricts the occupancy of all of the units in the project to two persons in a studio or 1 bedroom unit or three persons in a two or more bedroom unit. Reducons shall apply as follows: 
1. 
Studio: 1 space per dwelling unit 

2. 
1 BR: 1.25 spaces per dwelling unit 

3. 
2 BR: 1.5 spaces per dwelling unit 

4. 
3+ BR: 2.0 spaces per dwelling unit 


E. Reducof Parking Requirements for Age-Restricted Mulamily ResidenDevelopment. The o.-street parking requirements for dwelling units may be reduced if the Applicant restricts the occupancy of all the units in the project to persons aged 67 years and older. Reducons shall apply as follows: 
1. 
Studio, 1 BR, and 2 BR: 1 space per dwelling unit 

2. 
3+ BR: 2 spaces per dwelling unit 


F. Reducof Parking Requirements by Re-Use for a Bene.cial Purpose. Up to .ve percent of parking spaces that existed on the e.ecve date of this LUDC may be converted to other funcons, provided that: 
1. 
The reducon is used to improve the design or overall funcon of a site with an exisng building, and not to maximize the building envelope of a redevelopment site; 

2. 
The conversion is used to provide an area for: 


a. 
Bringing the site into compliance with disabled parking and / or accessibility requirements (see Secon 4-5-2-3, Required Accessible Parking Spaces); 

b. 
A screened enclosure for recycling bins; 

c. 
Ulity pedestals used for the relocaon of overhead ulies underground, provided that the ulity providers agree that the best locaon for the pedestals requires displacement of the parking space or spaces; and / or 

d. 
Adding landscaped area to a lot which does not conform to the landscape requirements of this LUDC (See Arcle 4-6, Landscaping and Bu.ering). 


3. 
The reducon does not reduce the amount of parking provided in the lot to less than 90 percent of the parking spaces that are required by the uses located on the lot; and 

4. 
There are no praccal alternave locaons for the funcons that displace the parking spaces. 


E.ecve on: 12/6/2017 
Sec. 4-5-2-7 Parking Credits and Reducransportaement Programs 
A. Generally. 
1. 
This Secon sets out several ways to reduce the number of required o.-street parking spaces using Transportaon Demand Management ("TDM") programs. These credits and reducons are based on programs that tend to reduce the peak demand for parking spaces. If used in conjuncon with shared parking (see Secon 4-5-2-9, Shared Parking), these reducons may be applied to one type of use to reduce the parking requirement for the use prior to calculang the shared parking reducon. 

2. 
The credits and reducons set out in this Secon are not available to uses that base their parking on a special study (see Secon 4-5-2-5, Special Studies), unless the special study's methodology speci.cally addresses these credits and reducons and determines that they are appropriate. 

3. 
The credits and reducons set out in this Secon are available only if the Applicant provides for regular monitoring and reporng of the use of the TDM program and its e.ect on parking demand. 


B. Reducarking Requirements by Provision of Shule Conneco the Durango-La Plata County Airport. 
1. 
For hotel / motel and bed and breakfast inn uses, parking may be reduced by 10 percent if on-demand shule service is provided to and from the Durango-La Plata County Airport. If the shule service is disconnued, the required parking must be provided. 

2. 
Shule services that are provided in order to ulize the o.-street parking reducons allowed by this Subsecon shall have a designated loading and unloading area with reasonable access to the principal building. 


C. Reducarking Requirements by Provision of Car-Share Program in the CB Zone. 
1. 
Mulfamily residenal uses may reserve one of the parking spaces required by Secon 4-5-2-2, Required O.-Street Parking Spaces (Parking Tables), for every 20 dwelling units (rounding up), for a car-share program. 

2. 
For each space reserved for a car-share program, the overall parking requirement may be reduced by two spaces. For example, if a studio apartment building was constructed with 15 units, 15 parking spaces would be required. If the building provides a car-share program which reserved one of the spaces, then the overall parking requirement (including the space used for the car share program) would be 13 spaces. 

3. 
To 	qualify for the car-share program reducon, the Applicant must demonstrate that the program will be operaonal when the building is fully occupied, and that one car will be available for each reserved parking space. 

4. 
If the program is terminated or reduced, the Applicant must provide the parking spaces for which credit is no longer due or pay a fee-in-lieu of those spaces if permied by Secon 4-5-2-8, Fee-in-Lieu of Required Parking. 


D. Reducarking Requirements by Employer-Based TDM Programs. 
1. 
Land uses which provide employment for 50 or more full-me equivalent employees may qualify for a reducon of up to 25 percent of their required parking by implementaon of a TDM program. The amount of the reducon shall correspond to the reducon in peak hour trip generaon that is directly aributable to the implementaon of the TDM program. The reducon requested shall be supported by a study by a quali.ed transportaon engineer. 

2. 
The TDM program shall include: 


a. 
Proposed performance targets; 

b. 
Jus.caons for esmaons of single-occupancy vehicle trips and ancipated reducons in parking demand; 

c. 
Designaon of a single "responsible enty" (e.g., the property owner or business owner) to implement and regularly monitor the required measures; 

d. 
A monitoring and reporng procedure; and 

e. 
A list of supplementary measures that will be implemented if the inial performance targets are not met, as determined by the monitoring procedures. 


3. Monitoring reports shall be submied to the Administrator two years aer building occupancy and on an annual basis thereaer for an addional .ve years. Aer the expiraon of the .ve-year period, the Administrator may require monitoring and reporng if spillover parking or undue localized congeson aributable to the use is observed or reported. 
a. 
If the monitoring reports indicate that the performance measures are not met, then the responsible enty must implement the supplemental measures iden.ed in the TDM Plan. 

b. 
If the monitoring reports indicate that the performance measures are not met during the subsequent reporng cycle, the City may require compliance with the parking requirements of this Division through further adjustments to the program, provision of addional parking spaces, or payment of fees-in-lieu (if authorized and approved pursuant to Secon 4-5-2-8, Fee-in-Lieu of Required Parking) su.cient to address the shorall of required parking spaces. 

c. 
In addion to the remedies available through the applicaon of Subsecons D.3.a. and D.3.b., above, the City may seek an injuncon to revoke the project's permits or approvals upon: 


1. 
Failure to submit required monitoring reports within 120 days of their due date; or 

2. 
Failure 	to meet performance targets aer implementaon of supplemental measures pursuant to Subsecons D.3.a., and D.3.b., above. 

3. 
As a condion of approval, the City may require that land be reserved or land-banked for addional parking if there is a demonstrably high probability the use could change, resulng in a higher demand for parking. 


E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-5-2-8 Fee-in-Lieu of Required Parking 
A. Generally. Parking requirements in the CB zone may be met (or parally met) through payment of a fee-in-lieu according to the standards of this Secon. 
B. Discrey Approval of Fee-in-Lieu. In the CB zone, the Planning Commission may, upon request of an Applicant, permit the Applicant to make a payment to the City in lieu of providing o.-street parking spaces. The Planning Commission may allow the payment of a fee in lieu if it .nds that: 
1. 
There are site-speci.c physical constraints or reasonable site design requirements that restrict the ability to provide the parking on-site. 

2. 
The historic signi.cance of exisng on-site or adjacent buildings, or other site features, would be a.ected adversely if the parking requirements were met on-site. 

3. 
The subject property is located near public parking lots or public transportaon routes. 

4. 
The fee-in-lieu allowance will not result in unfair impacts on any adjacent properes. 


C. "As-of-Right" Fee-in-Lieu. In the CB zone, an Applicant may make a payment to the City in lieu of providing parking spaces on a lot or parcel if a minimum of 75 percent of the required parking is provided on-site or by remote parking agreement (see Secon 4-5-3-2, Remote Parking). 
D. Amount of Fee. The fee amount shall be set by resoluon of the City Council and shall be computed on a per parking space basis (fraconal space shall be ulized rather than rounding to the next greatest number). The fee amount shall be based upon up to 100 percent of the esmated cost of providing a new above-ground structured parking space in the CB zone for the year in which the fee is established or amended. Esmates shall be provided by the Administrator in consultaon with the City Engineer. The fee amount may be amended by the City Council from me to me, to account for changes in the cost of providing an above-ground structured parking space within the CB Zone. 
E. Special Fund Created. Proceeds from the in-lieu parking fee shall be deposited in a special fund which shall be ulized for the acquision and / or construcon of parking improvements within the CB zone. The balance in such fund shall accrue unl authorized for expenditure by the City Council. Such expenditure shall be in accordance with a program for public parking improvements adopted by the City Council. Monies from the fund shall only be expended on acquision of land, construcon costs, or operaon and maintenance of the o.-street parking facilies within the CB Zone. 
F. Refunds. Upon peon by the present owner or owners of property for which a fee was paid, monies collected pursuant to this Secon, including any interest earned, shall be returned to the present owner or owners of the property if the fees have not been expended within seven years from the date that fees were paid, unless the City Council shall have designated the funds for expenditure on a speci.c parking project, in which case the City Council may, by moon, extend the me period for expenditure up to an addional three years. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-5-2-9 Shared Parking 
A. Generally. The City encourages the sharing of parking for its potenal to reduce impervious surfaces and / or enhance the e.ciency of land use. Thus, where a mix of uses creates synergy with respect to the ulizaon of parking spaces due to di.erences in peak parking demand periods, the City may reduce the required number of spaces according to the provisions of this Secon. 
B. Shared Parking Table. Shared parking allows a reducon in the total number of required parking spaces when a parcel is occupied by two or more uses which typically do not experience peak parking demands at the same me. When any land or building is used for two or more uses that are listed below, the minimum total number of required parking spaces may be determined by the following procedures: 
1. 
Mulply the minimum required parking for each individual use, excluding spaces reserved for use by speci.ed individuals or classes of individuals (except car share programs), by the appropriate percentage listed in Table 4-5­2-9, Shared Parking Table, for each of the designated me periods. 

2. 
Calculate a sum for all uses for each of the .ve me periods (columns). The minimum parking requirement is the highest of these sums, plus any reserved spaces that were excluded from the calculaon in the .rst step. Figure 4­5-2-9, IllustraShared Parking Credit Calcula, provides an example of how to use Table 4-5-2-9, Shared Parking Table, to calculate required parking.

TABLE NOTE: 
1. The largest number, 350, is the number of parking spaces that are required. This example is a 22 percent reducon compared to individual calculaons. 
3. In general, the maximum reducon allowed by Table 4-5-2-9, Shared Parking Table, shall be 30 percent. However, a greater reducon is permied, provided that: 
a. 
Su.cient land is set aside for each parking space in excess of the 30 percent reducon that is not constructed, so that the spaces may be constructed at a later date should the Administrator determine that they are necessary; and 

b. 
The property owner executes and records a document, approved as to form by the City Aorney, that guarantees that the spaces will be constructed upon wrien order of the Administrator. 

C. 
Special Shared Parking Study. 


1. In the alternave to the methodology in Table 4-5-2-9, Shared Parking Table, an Applicant may submit a special study to demonstrate that the parking required to serve mixed uses is less than the cumulave parking requirements for each individual use. The special study shall be conducted by a quali.ed transportaon planner or tra.c engineer at the Applicant's expense (the Administrator shall develop and maintain a list of quali.caons and / or cer.caons that are acceptable to the City for this purpose), and shall: 
a. 
Review peak parking demand periods for the proposed uses during a 24-hour weekday and each weekend day, and shall propose a required number of parking spaces based on the combined peak hour demand for parking. 

b. 
Provide data on the following: 


1. 
The sensivity of the proposed uses to change. 	For example, a center with no restaurant could have signi.cant changes in parking if a restaurant was added. 

2. 
Similar mixes of uses in other areas of the community. 

3. 
Degree of variability of parking for individual uses (average, range, and standard deviaon). 


2. The City may require a reserved open area if it .nds that the risk of parking needs changing over me so warrants. Once the project is occupied and well established, if there is a surplus of parking, the Applicant may peon for addional development capacity and parking using the reserved area. 
D. Shared Parking Among Lots Under Di.erent Ownership. When a shared parking reducon is to be applied to uses on several lots under di.erent ownership, the following shall be provided: 
1. 
A plan that provides for interconnected parking lots; and 

2. 
Recorded easements, approved as to form by the City Aorney, that provide, at a minimum, for: 


a. 
Cross-access among the parking areas and connecons to permit parking by the di.erent uses anywhere in the connected properes; 

b. 
Allocaon of maintenance responsibilies; 

c. 
A pedestrian circulaon system that connects uses and parking areas, making it easy and convenient to move between uses; and 

d. 
A right of enforcement by the City.

E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-6-2-2 Plant Units 
A. Generally. The plant unit is the basic unit of measurement for many of the requirements of this Arcle. It is a combinaon of plant material that provides a predictable volume of vegetaon (at maturity) at mulple elevaons. It also provides .exibility to the landscape designer with respect to the choice of planngs. In terms of volume, any plant unit is interchangeable with any other plant unit. However, certain plant units are preferable for specialized applicaon, such as in parking lots or under ulity lines. 
B. Plant Unit DescripThe required plant material for each of .ve interchangeable plant units are set out in Table 4­6-2-2, Plant Unit Descrip. The illustraon is intended to show the relave volume at planng, but is not intended to suggest that any parcular form or arrangement of the plant materials is required by a parcular plant unit type. Minimum sizes for landscaping materials at planng are set out in Secon 4-6-2-5, Size and Quality of Landscape Plants.

1. 
Rounding. Fraconal plant units shall be rounded to the nearest .ve hundredths using standard rounding (e.g., if the calculated plant unit requirement is 1.63, it is rounded up to 1.65). 

2. 
Calculaof PlanRequirement. The planng requirements of a fraconal plant unit are calculated by mulplying the fracon by the required number of each type of plant in the plant unit, with the product rounded o. using standard rounding. For example, 0.3 plant units, using the Standard Plant Unit as a base, would require 0 deciduous shade trees (0.3 x 1 = 0.3, rounded down to zero), 1 deciduous ornamental tree (0.3 x 2 = 0.6, rounded up to 1), 0 evergreens, and 4 shrubs (0.3 x 13 = 3.9, rounded up to 4). 

3. 
Small Frac. 


a. 
A fraconal plant unit of 0.10 or less shall be interpreted as a requirement for one shrub, regardless of the plant unit being used as the basis for the calculaon. 

b. 
Plant Unit Alternave D may not be rounded to less than one deciduous shade tree and one shrub. 


4. No Recombina. Di.erent plant unit types may not be divided into fracons and recombined for the purposes of reducing planng requirements.

Division 4-6-3 Bu.ering Requirements 
Sec. 4-6-3-1 Purpose and General Design Parameters for Bu.eryards 
A. Purposes of Bu.eryards. Bu.eryards are used to screen development from streets and adjacent properes, to enhance the streetscape, to improve compability of adjacent uses, and to protect natural resources from impacts of nearby development. 
B. Opacity and Width Standards. 
1. 
Opacity Standards. The opacity of the bu.eryard is a measure of the rough percentage of view that is blocked by the bu.eryard from grade to 35 feet above grade. Opacity is related to planng density, plant forms, bu.eryard widths, and the presence of structures (e.g., fences and walls) or topography (e.g., natural slopes or constructed berms). 

2. 
Width Standards. Comparable opacies can be achieved with bu.eryards of di.erent widths. However, in certain circumstances (e.g., where noise, dust, runo., or other non-visual impacts are to be migated by the bu.eryard), the width of the bu.eryard may be as important or more important than its opacity. Where bu.eryard widths are speci.ed by special, limited or condional use standards, alternaves with narrower widths are not allowed. 


C. Bu.eryard Design. 
1. 
Standard Bu.eryards. Secon 4-6-3-2, Standard Bu.eryards, sets out standard bu.eryard widths and planng requirements for each level of opacity that may be required by this LUDC. 

2. 
Bu.eryard Model. Secon 4-6-3-3, Bu.eryard AlternaCompliance Model, provides a model for the design of alternave bu.eryards that, in most circumstances, can be used to meet the bu.eryard opacity standards of this Division. 

3. 
Constrained Bu.eryards. Secon 4-6-3-4, Constrained Bu.eryards, sets out bu.eryard widths and planng requirements that may be used as an alternave to the standard bu.eryards if the installaon of standard bu.eryards would constrain development of the site beyond the thresholds established in this Secon.

Sec. 4-6-3-3 Bu.eryard Alternae Compliance Model 
A. Generally. In the alternave to manual calculaons the bu.eryards set out in Secon 4-6-3-2, Standard Bu.eryards, an Applicant may use the Bu.eryard Model to determine the bu.eryard requirements and alternaves for each level of opacity. The bu.eryard model computes the opacity of bu.eryards based on user-de.ned width, plant unit type, numbers of plant units per 100 linear feet of bu.eryard, the presence and height of berms or increases in elevaon, and the presence of, opacity of, locaon of, and height of fences and walls. 
B. Approval of Modeled Bu.eryards. Alternave bu.eryards developed using the Bu.eryard Model shall be approved if it is demonstrated that: 
1. 
Opacity. The opacity of proposed bu.eryards is at least that which is required by this LUDC. 

2. 
Width. 


a. 
The width of the proposed bu.eryard is not less than 10 feet, unless the site is constrained as de.ned in Secon 4-6-3-4, Constrained Bu.eryards. 

b. 
If a bu.eryard width is mandated by a special, limited, or condional use standard, no reducons from the speci.ed width are permied unless authorized by a variance. (See Secon 6-3-5-2, Variances.) 

c. 
The bu.eryard model must show that the proposed bu.eryard width is adequate, or a registered landscape architect shall cerfy that the plants selected for the bu.eryard will .t in the proposed space at maturity without compromising their health, longevity, or stability. 


3. Planequirements. The planng requirements of the bu.eryard model are measured on a per 100 linear feet basis. Planng requirements for bu.eryards shall be calculated as set out in Secon 4-6-2-2, Plant Units. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-6-3-4 Constrained Bu.eryards 
A. Generally. 
1. The constrained bu.eryard standards of this Secon may be applied in the alternave to the applicaon of the standards of Secon 4-6-3-2, Standard Bu.eryards, if in the determinaon of the Adminsitrator their the applicaon would: 
a. 
Cause the open space rao (OSR) or landscape surface rao (LSR) of the parcel proposed for development to exceed 150 percent of the applicable requirement of this LUDC; or 

b. 
Prevent praccal development of the parcel proposed for development by creang a building envelope that will not accommodate parking modules or praccal building designs. 


2. 
The standards of this Secon shall apply only to bu.eryards between 10 and 40 percent opacity. Uses that require 50 to 100 percent opacity bu.eryards should not be located on sites that cannot accommodate the bu.eryard and the use. 

3. 
The 	standards of this Secon shall be applied as necessary to remove the constraint. Generally, standard bu.eryards shall be replaced with constrained bu.eryards, starng with the least opaque bu.eryard and progressing to the most opaque bu.eryard. However, if the applicaon of this general rule would priorize the installaon of a masonry wall along a street bu.eryard over a rear bu.eryard, then the rear bu.eryard shall be reduced before the street bu.eryard. 


B. Constrained Bu.eryard Requirements. Constrained bu.eryards are narrower than their standard counterparts, but generally have increased planng or structural (fence or wall) requirements. Table 4-6-3-4, Constrained Bu.eryards, sets out the requirements. 
Table 4-6-3-4

E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 4-6-3-5 Zone Boundary Bu.eryards 
A. Generally. Table 4-6-3-5, Zone Boundary Bu.eryard Standards, sets out the opacity of the bu.eryard that is required between zones where: 
1. 
The boundary line follows the property line of the parcel proposed for development; 

2. 
The adjacent property is not separated from the parcel proposed for development by an easement, right-of-way, or permanent open space that is at least 50 feet in width, such as a public street, creek and trail, ulity easement, or resource protecon area; and 

3. 
In the MU-A Zone District the adjacent property is not separated from the parcel proposed for development by an alley that is at least 20 feet in width and the alley provides access to on-site parking. 


B. Interpretaof Table. The table is a matrix in which all districts are shown. Rows show the zoning of the parcel proposed for development, and columns show the zoning of the abung property. The cells that indicate NA (not applicable) is where both properes have the same zoning classi.caon. To calculate the required bu.eryard for a proposed development: 
1. 
The required bu.eryard opacity is the number in the cell at the intersecon between the row (which represents the zone of the parcel proposed for development) and the column (which represents the zone of abung property). This opacity is required if the abung property is developed but does not include a bu.eryard as required by this Secon. 

2. 
A reduced bu.eryard that is calculated as the di.erence between the bu.eryard opacity indicated for the parcel proposed for development and the bu.eryard that is required of the abung property (but not less than zero) is allowed if: 


a. 
The abung property is vacant; or 

b. 
The abung property is developed and the development includes at least the bu.eryard required by Table 4-6­3-5, Zone Boundary Bu.eryard Standards. 


3. The abbreviaon "NA" means that no bu.eryard is required on the parcel proposed for development, whether or not a bu.eryard is provided on abung property.

B. Perimeter Landscape Bu.er Standards. 
1. 
Width and Locaof Bu.er. A perimeter landscape bu.er that is at least .ve feet in width is required around the perimeter of parking lots except at areas of ingress, egress, cross-access, and except at areas between the parking lot and buildings on the same parcel (these areas are subject to the requirements of Secon 4-6-4-5, FoundaLandscaping). Areas used for vehicular overhangs pursuant to Secon 4-5-3-1, Parking Space and Aisle Standards, are not counted towards this required width of perimeter landscape bu.er. 

2. 
Planening Requirements. 


a. 
Perimeter landscape bu.ers must be planted with, at a minimum, groundcovers, shrubs, and / or perennials. Perimeter landscape bu.ers may also include trees which are required by Subsecon C., below.

Along areas in which the edge of the parking lot is closer than 20 feet to a property line, the perimeter landscape bu.er shall be planted with a connuous hedge of shrubs, perennials, and / or ornamental grasses, 


maintained at a minimum height of three feet, unless the area is screened by building walls or masonry walls on the lot or parcel proposed for development. 
c. If the boundary of a parking lot that contains 31 or more surface parking spaces is within 10 feet of a lot line that is shared by a single-family residenal lot, a duplex lot, or an EN (all sub-districts), RL, or RM zone boundary, then the perimeter bu.er or the bu.eryard required by Division 4-6-3, Bu.ering Requirements, if any, that is required along said lot line shall include: 
1. 
A six-foot tall solid fence or wall which separates the parking lot from the abung property; or 

2. 
A minimum of a 50 percent opacity bu.eryard (combined parking lot bu.er and bu.er required by Division 4-6-3, Bu.ering Requirements), which is composed of plant units that are suitable for year-round bu.ering. (Alternave B or C set out in Table 4-6-2-2, Plant Unit Descrip.) 

3. 
Relato Other Required Bu.ers. The land area used for perimeter landscape bu.ers may be combined with or overlap other bu.ers (e.g., district boundary bu.ers), provided that: 


a. 
The width and locaon of the perimeter landscape bu.er complies with Subsecon B.1., above; 

b. 
The area within the perimeter landscape bu.er is planted as required by Subsecon C., below; and

C. 
Tree Plan


1. 
Tree PlanRequirement. Parking lots shall be landscaped with at least one deciduous shade tree for each three parking spaces, with the quoent rounded up. This planng requirement is in addion to the other requirements of this LUDC (e.g., general landscaping requirements, bu.eryards, and street trees). 

2. 
Locatribu. 


a. 
Trees shall be located and spaced to promote healthy growing habits, and distributed such that each surface parking space is within 25 feet of the trunk of at least one tree. 

b. 
Required trees may be planted in the perimeter bu.er (see Subsecon B.1., above) and in tree islands within the parking lot, as necessary to meet the requirement of Subsecon C.2.a., above. 

c. 
In general, designs with tree islands that are larger in area and fewer in number (including islands which separate parking modules, as in Figure 4-6-2-3, Parking Lot Landscape Areas) are preferred to designs with tree islands which meet minimum size requirements but are greater in number. 


3. Tree Islands. 
a. 
Tree islands are allowed in any parking lot, but they are required in some parking lots (see Table 4-6-4-4, Applicability of Parking Lot Landscaping Standards).

E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 5-4-2-2 Alternae Compliance 
A. Generally. It is recognized that in some circumstances, a developer otherwise required to provide Fair Share Homes on-site within a development may be able to o.er an alternave means of compliance of equal value to the City. Such alternaves, if approved by the City, might include contribuons of cash, undeveloped land, or parally developed land. 
B. Allowable Alternae Means of Compliance. Only certain alternave means of compliance will be allowed by the City, as approved by the City Council from me to me, in consideraon of then current housing market condions, and as described in the Administrave Procedures Manual. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 5-4-2-3 Fees-in-Lieu 
A. Generally. It is the intent of this Arcle that the City may permit alternaves to the provision of Fair Share Homes within a development, including but not limited to, the payment of fees-in-lieu, which alternave means of compliance, if permied, will be described in the Administrave Procedures Manual. Such alternaves may be amended from me to me and must have a raonal basis for achieving similar public bene.ts to the provision of Fair Share Homes in a development. 
B. Fees-in-Lieu in Low Density Zones. RL, RA, and OS zones are not intended for deed-restricted a.ordable housing or aainable housing, as they involve increased landscape maintenance and transportaon costs. Therefore, fees-in-lieu of a.ordable housing or aainable housing are preferred in these zones. 
C. Fee-in-Lieu Alternae. Subject to limitaons described elsewhere in this Arcle, the following types of developments are (or may be) subject to paying fees-in-lieu of building Fair Share Homes: 
1. 
A development required to provide two or fewer Fair Share Homes. In this type of development, the developer, by right, may elect to pay fees in lieu of building Fair Share Homes.

3. 
Any other type of development for which this Arcle and the Administrave Procedures Manual allow the developer the opon of meeng some or all of the Fair Share Obligaon by payment of fees-in-lieu. 


D. Calculaees-in-Lieu. If and when in-lieu cash payments are allowed by the City, the amounts of such payments for each Fair Share Home not provided will be described in the Administrave Procedures Manual, derived by a market analysis and formula, which will result in a good-faith esmate of the amount of funds required to subsidize the purchase of a similar market-rate home to achieve approximately the same e.ecve price.

Division 5-4-4 Requirements for Providing Fair Share Homes 
Sec. 5-4-4-1 Fair Share Home Prices 
A. Generally. The sales price of Fair Share Homes (exclusive of closing costs) that are sold to cer.ed, eligible owner-occupants pursuant to a Fair Share Agreement shall be at or below certain prices described in the Administrave Procedures Manual. 
B. Price Adjustments. Fair Share Home Prices shall be amended from me to me, based upon changes in area median incomes, prevailing interest rates, and other market condions that a.ect housing a.ordability. The Administrave Procedures Manual shall contain procedures for calculang and updang home prices for purposes of this Arcle, so that such prices reasonably re.ect current market condions and so that the prices of Fair Share Homes cannot be manipulated by side agreements or added fees. 
C. Division into Tiers. Fair Share Home prices shall be divided into several ers corresponding to several ers of household incomes below 125 percent of area median income, so that discount-priced homes are reasonably and cost-e.ciently distributed to eligible families at di.erent income levels. Fair Share Home prices shall be determined by using reasonable formulas for calculang a.ordability, taking into account various factors, including, but not limited to, current prevailing interest rates, esmated minimum down payment requirements of lenders, esmated costs of property insurance and real estate taxes, esmated typical costs of homeowner associaon fees, and a reasonable percentage of income to be spent on these housing costs. 
D. E.ect of Unit Size. The Administrave Procedures Manual shall describe Fair Share Home Prices by various bedroom sizes of Fair Share Homes, based upon reasonable assumpons regarding the space needs of households of various sizes which occupy a Fair Share Home. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 5-4-4-2 Price Adjustment for Green Building Features 
As an incenve for Fair Share Developers to provide homes with energy-e.cient and healthy designs and materials, and considering the addion bene.ts to Fair Share Homebuyers, the maximum Fair Share Home Price of such homes will be adjusted upwards in accordance with a schedule of price adjustments in the Administrave Procedures Manual. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 5-4-4-3 Restricd-Party Subsidies by For-Pro.t Builders 
The required sale price of a Fair Share Home by a for-pro.t developer may not be achieved by use of subsidies from any source other than the developer, so that, given the scarcity of subsidy funds, all Fair Share Applicants that are for-pro.t enes will be treated equally and fairly. However, the City encourages the use of such subsidies to reduce prices of Fair Share Homes from the maximum amounts allowed by this Arcle to a lower price, or to fund or parally fund down payments and closing costs of Fair Share Homebuyers. It is expected that local nonpro.t and government mortgage assistance programs will o.er such subsidies on some Fair Share Homes. Nonpro.t builders and developers may use subsidies to achieve the required Fair Share Home Prices. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 5-4-4-4 Required Number of Fair Share Homes; Frac
A. Generally. In any development that is obligated to ful.ll Fair Share Requirements by directly providing Fair Share Homes, the number of Fair Share Homes shall be equal to 16 percent of the total number of homes proposed to be built (the total to include both Fair Share Homes and market-rate homes). 
B. FracThe whole number resulng from the calculaon in Subsecon A., above, shall be the number of homes required. Fees-in-lieu may apply if fracons result from this calculaon (see Secon 5-4-2-3, Fees-in-Lieu). Alternavely, a land donaon of equivalent value that may be used in support of a.ordable housing or aainable housing may be accepted by the City. 
C. Mulojects. It is ancipated that in larger developments being built in phases over a number of years, the number of market-rate homes may not be certain at the me of execuon of the Fair Share Agreement. In such cases, the Fair Share Agreement will include an esmated number of market-rate homes and esmated required number of Fair Share Homes for the enre project. If the number of homes in the .rst phase of such development is certain at the me of execuon of the Fair Share Agreement, then a separate Fair Share Pricing and Delivery Schedule for that phase shall be incorporated in the Agreement. As the number of homes in future phases becomes certain, the agreement shall provide for RHA to administravely approve subsequent Fair Share Pricing and Delivery Schedules for future phases of the development, consistent with the overall Fair Share Requirements of the development. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 5-4-4-5 Pricing and Delivery Schedules 
In a Fair Share Proposal or Fair Share Agreement or as otherwise required by this Arcle, the Fair Share Pricing and Delivery Schedules shall be in the form of a chart that contains the numbers of required Fair Share Homes by bedroom size and price er, and shall indicate the current Fair Share Home Price for each size of home in each er. The Administrave Procedures Manual shall describe how the required number of Fair Share Homes shall be distributed in the various price ers and required bedroom sizes. Such distribuon by price ers shall be based primarily upon an assessment of housing needs among the income groups corresponding to price ers, but shall take into account the economic impact on developments subject to Fair Share. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 5-4-4-6 Design and Construcair Share Homes 
A. Required Numbers of Bedrooms in Fair Share Homes. In each Fair Share Development, Fair Share Homes shall represent a mix of bedroom sizes as similar as possible (given rounding of numbers) to the mix of bedroom sizes of the market-rate homes in the development. 
B. Standards for Design and ConstrucThe Administrave Procedures Manual shall de.ne reasonable standards for the design and construcon of Fair Share Homes to ensure livability and compability with nearby market-rate homes in the development, including, but not limited to, numbers of bathrooms, garages and parking areas, minimum .oor areas, mechanical equipment and hookups, locaon of Fair Share Homes within developments, design and materials, and green building features. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 5-4-4-7 Cost O.sets for Fair Share Developers 
A. Generally. In an e.ort to assist in making residenal construcon less costly and therefore, more a.ordable, the City o.ers the following cost o.sets to Fair Share Developers in consideraon of their construcon and sale of Fair Share Homes, and to the extent that price discounts on such homes are equal to or exceed such cost o.sets. These cost o.sets do not apply to applicaons for residenal developments located outside the City limits, which are requesng the extension of or connecon to City ulies. 
B. Fee Refunds and Waivers. Developers of Fair Share Homes are entled a refund of certain development fees paid to the City, as follows: 
1. 
Such refunds will be made only for fees paid in connecon with the construcon of a Fair Share Home in Price Tiers 1, 2 or 3, with such refund payable only aer a sale to a quali.ed buyer has been cer.ed by RHA. 

2. 
The fees paid or allocable on a per-dwelling-unit basis that qualify for such refunds are as follows: 


a. 
Building permit fees; 

b. 
Use tax; 

c. 
Land use applicaon fees (see Subsecon B.5., below) 

d. 
Water plant investment fees; 

e. 
Sewer plant investment fees; and 

f. 
Water tap fees. 


3. 
With regard to sewer plant investment fees, the City will, via a refund, subsidize a poron of the fee paid for connecon to the South Durango Sewer District (SDSD) lines. Such poron shall be equal to the sewer plant investment fee that would have been applicable to a similar connecon within the City at the me the fee was paid to the SDSD. 

4. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the total amount of fees refunded for construcons and sale of a Fair Share Home shall not exceed the price discount for that home, as de.ned in Secon 5-4-5-6, Resale Controls and Subsidy Recapture. This provision, combined with the recapture provisions described in Secon 5-4-5-6, Resale Controls and Subsidy Recapture, has the e.ect of ensuring that there is a mechanism for fully recovering the cost of fee refunds and waivers. 

5. 
Land use applicaon fees will be refunded for projects that are enrely residenal and in which all of the residenal units have price and income restricons equivalent to or lower than those for Fair Share Homes. At the City's sole discreon, such fees may be waived in advance rather than refunded.

Division 5-5-3 Stormwater Management Plans and Stormwater BMPs 
Sec. 5-5-3-1 Stormwater Management Plans 
A. Stormwater Management Plans. Stormwater management plans (SWMPs) are associated with stormwater quality permits for the City of Durango and the State. A SWMP is required to be prepared prior to applying for coverage under the permit. The SWMP, must be submied with the applicaon (see Secon 6-3-4-3, Stormwater Quality Permits). 
1. 
The SWMP shall be prepared in accordance with all of the requirements of the most recent SWMP guidance document prepared by the Division and good engineering, hydrologic, and polluon control pracces. 

2. 
The SWMP will be reviewed by the City, as noted in Secon 6-3-4-3, Stormwater Quality Permits. The SWMP must be approved by the City prior to implementaon and before construcon acvies commence. 


B. The SWMP shall: 
1. 
Idenfy all potenal sources of polluon which may reasonably be expected to a.ect the quality of stormwater discharges associated with construcon acvity from the facility; 

2. 
Describe the pracces to be used to reduce the pollutants in stormwater discharges associated with construcon acvity at the facility and ensure the pracces are selected and described in accordance with good engineering pracces, including the installaon, implementaon, and maintenance requirements; 

3. 
Be implemented prior to commencement of construcon acvies; and 

4. 
Be properly prepared and updated in accordance with subsecon F, below, to ensure compliance with the terms and condions of the permit. 


C. Required ImplementaAs a condion of the permit, facilies must implement the provisions of the SWMP as wrien and updated, from commencement of construcon acvity unl .nal stabilizaon is complete. 
1. The City reserves the right to review the SWMP, and to require the permiee to develop and implement addional measures to prevent and control polluon as needed. 
D. Other Requirements. The SWMP may re.ect requirements for spill prevenon control and countermeasure ("SPCC") plans under Secon 311 of the Federal Clean Water Act, or BMP Programs otherwise required by a separate CDPS permit, and may incorporate any part of such plans into the SWMP by reference, provided that the relevant Secons or such plans are available as part of the SWMP consistent with subsecon F, below. 
E. DocumentaA copy of the SWMP must be retained on site unless another locaon, speci.ed by the permiee, is approved by the City. 
F. SWMP Review/Changes. The permiee shall amend the SWMP: 
1. When there are changes which would require the implementaon of new or revised BMPs, including: 
a. 
Design changes; 

b. 
Major changes in construcon acvies; and / or 

c. 
Changes to the operaon or maintenance of the site BMPs; 


2. 
If the SWMP proves to be ine.ecve in achieving the general objecves of controlling pollutants in stormwater discharges associated with the construcon acvity; or 

3. 
When BMPs are no longer necessary and removed. 


a. SWMP changes shall be made prior to changes in the site condions, except as allowed for in Subsecon G., below. SWMP revisions may include, but are not limited to: 
1. 
Potenal pollutant source iden.caon; 

2. 
Selecon of appropriate BMPs for site condions; 

3. 
BMP maintenance procedures; and 

4. 
Interim and .nal stabilizaon pracces. 


b. 
The SWMP changes may include a schedule for further BMP design and implementaon, provided that, if any interim BMPs are needed to comply with the permit, they are also included in the SWMP and implemented during the interim period. 

G. 
Responsive SWMP Changes. SWMP changes addressing BMP installaon and/or implementaon are oen required to be made in response to changing condions, or when current BMPs are determined ine.ecve. The majority of SWMP revisions to address these changes can be made immediately with quick in-the-.eld revisions to the SWMP. In the less common scenario where more complex development of materials to modify the SWMP is necessary, SWMP revisions shall be made in accordance with the following requirements: 


1. 
The SWMP shall be revised as soon as praccable, but in no case more than 72 hours aer the change(s) in BMP installaon and / or implementaon occur at the site, and 

2. 
A notaon must be included in the SWMP prior to the site change(s) that includes the me and date of the change(s) in the .eld, iden.caon of the BMP(s) removed or added, and the locaon(s) of those BMP(s). 


H. SWMP Availability. A copy of the SWMP shall be provided upon request from the City, Water Quality Control Division (WQCD) of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), or EPA in charge of approving sediment and erosion plans, grading plans, or stormwater management plans, and within the me frame speci.ed in the request. 
I. Public Availability. All SWMPs required under the permit are considered reports that shall be available to the public under Secon 308(b) of the Federal Clean Water Act and Secon 61.5(4) of the CDPS Regulaons. The permiee shall make plans available to members of the public upon request. However, the permiee may claim any poron of a SWMP as con.denal in accordance with 40 CFR Part 2. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 5-5-3-2 Required Site Inspec
A. Site InspecSite inspecons must be conducted in accordance with the following requirements and minimum schedules. The required minimum inspecon schedules do not reduce or eliminate the permiee's responsibility to implement and maintain BMPs in good and e.ecve operaonal condion, and in accordance with the SWMP, which could require more frequent inspecon. Inspecons shall be documented on a form prescribed by the City. 
1. Minimum InspecSchedule for AcConstrucSites: The permiee shall, at a minimum, make a thorough inspecon, in accordance with the requirements in Subsecon B. of this Secon. 
a. 
Also, post-storm event inspecons must be conducted within 24 hours aer the end of any precipitaon or snowmelt event that causes surface erosion. Provided the ming is appropriate, the post-storm inspecons may be used to ful.ll the 14-day roune inspecon requirement. 

b. 
At least every 14 calendar days. 


2. A more frequent inspecon schedule than the minimum inspecons described may be necessary, to ensure that BMPs connue to operate as needed to comply with the permit. The following condional modi.caons to this minimum inspecon schedule are allowed: 
a. 
Post-storm event inspecons at temporary idle sites. If no construcon acvies will occur following a storm event, post-storm event inspecons shall be conducted prior to re-commencing construcon acvies, but no later than 72 hours following the storm event. The occurrence of any such delayed inspecon must be documented in the inspecon record. Roune inspecons sll must be conducted at least every 14 calendar days. 

b. 
Inspecons at completed sites / areas. For sites or porons of sites that meet the following criteria, but .nal stabilizaon has not been achieved due to a vegetave cover that has not become established, the permiee shall make a thorough inspecon of their stormwater management system at least once every month, and post-storm event inspecons are not required. This reduced inspecon schedule is only allowed if: 


1. 
All construcon acvies that will result in surface ground disturbance are completed; 

2. 
All acvies required for .nal stabilizaon, in accordance with the SWMP, have been completed, with the excepon of the applicaon of seed that has not occurred due to seasonal condions or the necessity for addional seed applicaon to augment previous e.orts; and 

3. 
The SWMP has been amended to indicate those areas that will be inspected in accordance with the reduced schedule allowed for in this subsecon. 


c. Winter condions inspecons exclusion. Inspecons are not required at sites where construcon acvies are temporarily halted, snow cover exists over the enre site for an extended period, and melng condions posing a risk of surface erosion do not exist. This excepon is applicable only during the period where melng condions do not exist, and applies to the roune 14-day and monthly inspecons, as well as the post-storm­event inspecons. The following informaon must be documented in the inspecon record for use of this exclusion: dates when snow cover occurred, date when construcon acvies ceased, and date melng condions began. Inspecons, as described above, are required at all other mes. 
3. When site condions make the schedule required in this Secon impraccal, the permiee may peon the City to grant an alternate inspecon schedule. 
B. Inspecequirements. 
1. 
InspecScope. The construcon site perimeter, all disturbed areas, material and / or waste storage areas that are exposed to precipitaon, discharge locaons, and locaons where vehicles access the site shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potenal for, pollutants leaving the construcon site boundaries, entering the site's stormwater drainage system, MS4, or waters of the State. All erosion and sediment control pracces iden.ed in the SWMP shall be evaluated to ensure that they are maintained and operang correctly. 

2. 
InspecReports / Records. The permitee shall keep a record of inspecons on a form prescribed by the City. Inspecon reports must idenfy any incidents of noncompliance with the terms and condions of the permit. Inspecon records must be retained for three years from inacvaon of permit coverage. At a minimum, the inspecon report must include: 


a. 
The inspecon date; 

b. 
Name(s) and tle(s) of personnel making the inspecon; 

c. 
Locaon(s) of discharges of sediment or other pollutants from the site; 

d. 
Locaon(s) of BMPs that need to be maintained; 

e. 
Locaon(s) of BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate for a parcular locaon; 

f. 
Locaon(s) where addional BMPs are needed that were not in place at the me of inspecon; 

g. 
Deviaons from the minimum inspecon schedule as provided in Subsecon A, above; 

h. 
Descripon of correcve acon for items c., d., e., and f., above, dates correcve acon(s) taken, and measures taken to prevent future violaons, including requisite changes to the SWMP, as necessary; and 

i. 
Aer adequate correcve acon(s) has been taken, or where a report does not idenfy any incidents requiring correcve acon, the report shall contain a signed statement indicang the site is in compliance with the permit to the best of the signer's knowledge and belief. 


3. Required Acfollowing Site Inspec. Where site inspecons note the need for BMP maintenance acvies, BMPs must be maintained in accordance with the SWMP, Secon 5-5-3-3, ConstrucBest Management Praces, and Secon 5-5-3-4, Operaand Maintenance of Stormwater BMPs. Repair, replacement, or installaon of new BMPs determined necessary during site inspecons to address ine.ecve or inadequate BMPs must be conducted in accordance with Secon 5-5-3-4, Operaand Maintenance of Stormwater BMPs. SWMP updates required as a result of de.ciencies in the SWMP noted during site inspecons shall be made in accordance with Secon 5-5-3-1, Stormwater Mangement Plans.

Sec. 5-5-3-3 Construct Management Pracs") 
A. ConstrucMPs. Construcon site operators shall protect water quality and control runo. and erosion through the implementaon of Construcon BMPs. 
B. Structural and Nonstructural BMPs. The selecon, design, and installaon of appropriate structural and nonstructural BMPs must be done in accordance to the latest revision of the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District's Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual. 
C. Types of ConstrucBMPs. Construcon BMPs include Erosion Control BMPs, Sediment Control BMPs, as well material and site management BMPs. 
1. 
Erosion Control BMPs (e.g. mulching, erosion blankets, check dams etc.) limit the amount and rate of erosion occurring on disturbed areas. 

2. 
Sediment Control BMPs (e.g. silt fence, inlet/outlet protecon, sediment traps/basins etc.) aempt to capture the soil that has been eroded before it leaves the construcon site. 

3. 
Material Management BMPs (e.g. stockpile management, good housekeeping pracces etc.) limit contact of runo. with pollutants commonly found at construcon sites, such as construcon materials and equipment-related .uids. 

4. 
Site Management BMPs (e.g. construcon phasing/sequencing, protecon of exisng vegetaon, street sweeping etc.) minimize erosion and sediment transport by considering construcon phasing, scheduling, and sequencing of land disturbing acvies. These BMPs minimize the duraon/quanty of exposed soils suscepble to erosion. Site management also ensures BMPs implemented at the site are properly selected, installed, inspected, maintained, and properly repaired to reduce erosion and sediment transport on the site. 


D. Other Required Controls. As part of the Citys Municipal stormwater permit, construcon site operators are required to use a combinaon of both erosion and sediment control BMPs to control waste materials and non-stormwater discharges. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 5-5-3-4 Operatenance of Stormwater BMPs 
A. BMP Maintenance. All erosion and sediment control pracces and other protecve measures iden.ed in the SWMP must be maintained in e.ecve operang condion. 
1. 
Proper selecon and installaon of BMPs and implementaon of comprehensive inspecon and maintenance procedures, in accordance with the SWMP, should be adequate to meet this condion. 

2. 
BMPs that are not adequately maintained in accordance with good engineering, hydrologic, and polluon control pracces, including removal of collected sediment outside the acceptable tolerances of the BMPs, are considered to be no longer operang e.ecvely and must be addressed in accordance with Subsecon B., below.. 

3. 
A 	speci.c meline for implemenng maintenance procedures is not included in this permit because BMP maintenance is expected to be proacve, not responsive. 

4. 
Observaons resulng in BMP maintenance acvies can be made during a site inspecon, or during general observaons of site condions. 


B. Replacement and Failed BMPs. Adequate site assessment must be performed as part of comprehensive inspecon and maintenance procedures to assess the adequacy of BMPs at the site and the necessity of changes to those BMPs to ensure connued e.ecve performance. 
1. 
Where site assessment results in the determinaon that new or replacement BMPs are necessary, the BMPs must be installed to ensure on-going implementaon of BMPs as per Secon 5-5-3-1, Stormwater Management Plans. 

2. 
Where BMPs have failed, resulng in noncompliance with Secon 5-5-3-1, Stormwater Management Plans, they must be addressed as soon as possible (immediately in most cases) to minimize the discharge of pollutants. 

3. 
When new BMPs are installed or BMPs are replaced, the SWMP must be updated in accordance with Secon 5-5-3­
1, Stormwater Management Plans. 


E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 5-5-3-5 Final Stabiliza
A. DeterminaFinal stabilizaon is reached when all ground surface disturbing acvies at the site have been completed, and uniform vegetave cover has been established with an individual plant density of at least 70 percent of pre-disturbance levels, or equivalent permanent, physical erosion reducon methods have been employed. 
B. Vegetae Cover. For purposes of this permit, establishment of a vegetave cover capable of providing erosion control equivalent to pre-exisng condions at the site will be considered .nal stabilizaon. 
C. Amendments. The City may, aer consultaon with the permiee and/or operator and upon good cause, amend the .nal stabilizaon criteria for speci.c operaons. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014

CHAPTER 6 ADMINISTRATION 
ARTICLE 6-1 NONCONFORMITIES 
Division 6-1-1 Purpose and Applica
Sec. 6-1-1-1 Purpose of Ar
A. Generally. Much of the land area of the City of Durango is already developed. As such, the applicaon of new regulaons to exisng development is likely to create circumstances in which exisng lot dimensions, density, intensity, land uses, buildings, structures, landscaping and bu.ering, lighng, parking areas, or signs do not strictly conform to the requirements of the new regulaons. For exisng lots or development (including uses, buildings, structures, and signs) that is / are "legally nonconforming" (as de.ned in Division 6-1-2, Types and Classes of Nonconformis), this Arcle sets out equitable rules for whether, when, and how the regulaons of this LUDC apply. 
B. EN Districts. The EN zones are intended to minimize nonconformies in established neighborhoods by making exisng lots that were lawfully created "conforming." 
C. Conversion of NonconformiGenerally, nonconforming uses, buildings, structures, and signs are not allowed to be enlarged, expanded, increased, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses now prohibited in the same zone. This Arcle provides standards by which minor nonconforming uses (as de.ned in Secon 6-1-2-1, Nonconforming Uses) can be made "conforming" through a public hearing process. 
D. Reducof NonconformiIt is the policy of the City to encourage reinvestments in property that increase its value and ulity and improve its aesthecs and environmental performance. Since bringing a developed parcel into full compliance with this LUDC may involve substanal costs (which could discourage reinvestment), Division 6-1-4, Incremental Compliance, provides a set of thresholds for determining when new construcon or modi.caons to development trigger a requirement for increasing conformity with the various requirements of this LUDC. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 6-1-1-2 Applica
A. Generally. This Arcle applies to uses, accessory uses, buildings, structures, landscaping and bu.ering, signs, lighng, parking, and lots that were lawfully created or constructed but do not conform to the requirements of this LUDC. 
B. E.ect of ArNothing in this LUDC shall be interpreted to require a change in plans, construcon, or designated use of any building in which a building permit was lawfully obtained from the City's Building Division prior to the e.ecve date of this LUDC or subsequent amendment, provided that construcon: 
1. 
Was commenced within 60 days aer obtaining said building permit; and 

2. 
Work is proceeding diligently toward compleon. 


C. Changes of Ownership. Nothing in this Arcle shall be construed to a.ect or restrict changes in ownership, nor shall changes in ownership a.ect the applicaon of any of the requirements of this Arcle. 
D. Evidence of Status. Evidence that a nonconforming situaon is a legal nonconformity and not a violaon of this LUDC shall be submied by the owner of the property or use upon request of the Administrator. 
E. Excepo Ar
1. 
EN Zones. This Arcle does not apply to lots of record in the EN zones, regardless of their size (such lots, and lawfully constructed buildings on them, are "conforming"). 

2. 
Previously Approved Applica. This Arcle does not apply to site speci.c development approvals for which rights are vested during the period of vested rights. 

3. 
Unlawful Uses, Buildings, Structures, or Signs. This Arcle does not allow for the perpetuaon of uses, buildings, structures, lighng, or signs that were unlawfully established or constructed. Such uses, buildings, structures, lighng, or signs are not "legally nonconforming," but instead are "unlawful," and are subject to all of the provisions of this LUDC (including enforcement provisions) and any other applicable law. Likewise, this Arcle does not legimize unlawful subdivisions of property that may have occurred before the e.ecve date of this LUDC. 

4. 
Natural Shiof Zone Boundaries. If a zone boundary changes as a result of a change in locaon of a stream channel centerline, such change of zone boundary does not render exisng development nonconforming. (See also, Secon 2-1-2-4, InterpretaZoning Map.) 


F. Types of Nonconformi
1. There are 10 general types of nonconformies: 
a. 
Uses; 

b. 
Density; 

c. 
Accessory Uses; 

d. 
Buildings; 

e. 
Structures; 

f. 
Landscaping and Bu.ering; 

g. 
Signs; 

h. 
Lighng; 

i. 
Parking; and 

j. 
Lots. 


2. Nonconforming uses may be "major" or "minor." These types of nonconformity are set out in Division 6-1-2, Types and Classes of Nonconformis. The applicaon of the standards of this Arcle is based on the type of nonconformity that is being addressed. 
G. Regulaof NonconformiDivision 6-1-3, Regulaof Nonconformis, sets out the standards for when nonconforming uses and nonconforming situaons must be made conforming or, alternavely, terminated or removed. It also sets out the circumstances in which a nonconforming use or nonconforming situaon may be restored or resumed aer damage, destrucon, or temporary cessaon of the use. 
H. Incremental Compliance. Division 6-1-4, Incremental Compliance, sets out the standards for determining when new construcon or modi.caons to development trigger a requirement for increasing overall conformity with the various requirements of this LUDC, and how the nature and degree of such conformity is determined. 
I. Conversion of NonconformiDivision 6-1-5, Conversion of Nonconformis, sets out how to convert a nonconforming use to a conforming use using a condional use process. Division 6-1-5, Conversion of Nonconformis, applies only to uses. Nonconforming buildings and structures may be made conforming using the variance process set out in Secon 6-3-5-2, Variances.

Division 6-1-2 Types and Classes of Nonconformi
Sec. 6-1-2-1 Nonconforming Uses 
A. Generally. A nonconforming use is a use of land that was lawfully established (i.e., it was allowed and legally authorized, if legal authorizaon was required) on a parcel or lot before the e.ecve date of this LUDC (or amendment hereto), but is no longer allowed aer the e.ecve date of this LUDC (or amendment hereto). The following uses are legally nonconforming uses: 

1. Currently Prohibited Uses. Uses that were lawfully established but are not currently listed as permied, special, limited, or condional uses in the zone in Division 2-1-3, Use / Zone Matrices, except that: 
a. Structures that were listed as principal uses prior to the e.ecve date, which are currently regulated only as accessory structures, are either: 
1. 
Conforming structures; or 

2. 
Nonconforming structures; and 


b. Accessory uses that were listed as principal uses prior to the e.ecve date, which are currently regulated only as accessory uses are either: 
1. 
Conforming accessory uses; or 

2. 
Nonconforming accessory uses. 


2. Special and Limited Uses without Special or Limited Use Approval. Uses that are listed as special or limited uses in the zone in Division 2-1-3, Use / Zone Matrices, but:

b. 
Do not comply with the applicable special or limiteduse standards of Division 2-2-3, Speci.c Standards for Special, Limited, and Condis. 


3. 
CondiUses without CondiUse Approval. Uses that are listed as condional uses in the zone in Division 2-1-3, Use / Zone Matrices, but were lawfully established without a condional use permit. For these uses, the nonconforming use status may be removed by obtaining a condional use permit. 

4. 
Uses in the Floodplain or Floodway. Uses that are not permied in the .oodplain or .oodway, but: 


a. 
Were established in the .oodplain or .oodway before the prohibion; or 

b. 
Were established outside of the .oodplain or .oodway, but subsequently included in it aer revision of .oodplain or .oodway boundaries. 


5. Uses that Exceed Density Limita. Nonconforming uses include situaons where the number of dwelling units that lawfully existed on a lot prior to the e.ecve date of this LUDC is greater than the number of dwelling units that could be constructed on the same lot pursuant to this LUDC.

b. 
Any applicable standards of Secon 6-1-3-1, Conermina, are met; and 

c. 
The alteraon will eliminate the nonconformity or reduce the nonconformity in accordance with the standards of Division 6-1-4, Incremental Compliance. 

C. 
Expansion of Nonconforming Uses. 


1. 
Major Nonconforming Uses. Major nonconforming uses shall not be expanded, enlarged, extended, increased, or moved to occupy an area of land or building that was not occupied on the e.ecve date of this LUDC or any amendment that made the use a major nonconforming use. 

2. 
Minor Nonconforming Uses. No minor nonconforming use shall be expanded or extended in such a way as to: 


a. 
Occupy any open space or landscaped area that is required by this LUDC; 

b. 
Increase the area of .oodplain (if present) that is directly impacted by the use; 

c. 
Exceed building coverage or height limitaons of the zone in which the use is located;

Sec. 6-1-3-4 Combinaonforming Lots 
A. Generally. Where a landowner owns several abung lots that do not conform to the dimensional requirements of the zone in which they are located, they shall be combined to create fully conforming lots upon applicaon for development approval. If full conformity is not possible, they shall be combined if the combinaon will increase the degree of conformity. 
B. ExcepThe City will not require the combinaon of lots pursuant to Subsecon A., above, if: 
1. 
The combinaon of lots would not remove or materially migate a nonconforming aspect of the nonconforming lot; 

2. 
Two or more of the lots are developed with principal buildings, and the combinaon of lots would require that one or more of the buildings be demolished or substanally modi.ed in order to comply with this LUDC; 

3. 
The combinaon of lots would materially disrupt the long paern of the street, for example, by creang a through lot mid-block on a street segment that does not include any other through lots; 

4. 
The combinaon of lots would result in regularly shaped lots being combined into a single lot with an irregular shape; or 

5. 
The lots are located in an EN zone (in which case they are not nonconforming, but may sll be required to be combined pursuant to Secon 3-1-1-3, Status of ExisLots and Buildings in the EN Zones; Required Services, and not this Secon). 


Figure 6-1-3-4 
Illustrae Combinaceps 

In the illustraon below, none of the lots are located in an EN zone, so the excepon in Subsecon B.5. does not apply. 
-
 Owner A owns three lots (shown in orange) that are nonconforming with respect to lot width: A Lot 1, A Lot 2, and A Lot 3. Owner A will have to combine A Lot 2 with A Lot 3 because doing so will bring the combined lot into compliance with the lot width requirement. However, Lot 1 will not have to be combined because: (1) is would not remove or materially migate the nonconforming lot width (Subsecon B.1.); (2) it would create a through lot where no other through lots exist (subsecon B.3.); and (3) it would result in an irregularly shaped lot if combined with A Lot 2 and A Lot 3 (subsecon B.4.). 

-
 Owner B owns two lots (shown in green) that share an interior side lot line. Both are nonconforming with respect to lot width. Owner B will have to combine B Lot 1 with B Lot 2 because doing so will bring the combined lot into compliance with the lot width requirement. 

-
 Owner C owns two lots (shown in red) which are both developed with principal buildings. If the zone does not allow two principal buildings on a single lot, then C Lot 1 and C Lot 2 do not have to be combined because of Subsecon B.2.

Sec. 6-1-4-5 Discrey Sliding Scale Compliance 
A. Generally. The standards of this Secon may be applied by the Planning Commission in the alternave to the standards of Secon 6-1-4-4, Administraale Compliance. This process shall be administered by referring a site plan or other proposed applicaon for development approval to the Planning Commission for simultaneous consideraon. 
B. Threshold Requirements. The standards of this Secon may be applied only upon a .nding that: 
1. Except as allowed pursuant to Subsecon C.2., below, the type of improvements proposed will not increase the level of nonconformity with respect to: 
a. 
The area of the property or building that is directly a.ected by the proposed improvements; or 

b. 
Any other aspects of the development (e.g., .oor area increases that would result in increased nonconformity with respect to drainage, open space, or required parking are not allowed); and 


2. The 	level of addional compliance that is required according to the standards set out in Secon 6-1-4-4, Administraale Compliance cannot be achieved because: 
a. 
The geometry of the site will not accommodate the level of addional compliance that is required by Table 6-1­
4-4, Administraale Compliance Requirements; or 

b. 
The cost of achieving the level of addional compliance that is required by Table 6-1-4-4, AdministraSliding Scale Compliance Requirements, is unreasonably disproporonate to the type of improvement that is proposed; and 


3. If the proposed improvements will result in a building expansion that is more than .ve percent of the exisng gross .oor area, then major nonconforming uses will be disconnued as a condion of approval. 
C. Standards. The Planning Commission may establish the level of addional compliance that will be required as follows: 
1. 
The level of addional compliance will be reasonably proporonal to the level of investment in the property that is proposed. 

2. 
The level of addional compliance that is required will address the planning priories listed below, which are set out in descending order of priority. The priories shall be considered in order of importance if it is not feasible or equitable to require that all of the priories be addressed. To maximize the bene.t of the required improvements with respect to the funcon and aesthecs of the site, the Planning Commission may allow minor deviaons from other LUDC requirements in order to promote more signi.cant priories (e.g., for some development, the Planning Commission may determine that the need for landscaping and drainage improvements jus.es a minor reducon in the number of parking spaces on the site). 


a. 
Resolving material public safety issues (e.g., improvements at points of access to prevent accidents on abung streets, improvements to emergency access, improvements to internal circulaon where dangerous condions exist, migaon of .ood hazards, geologic hazards, or wild.re hazards, etc.). 

b. 
Achieving compliance with the Americans with Disabilies Act (ADA). 

c. 
Improving the water quality of stormwater runo.. 

d. 
Improving connecvity pursuant to Division 4-2-4, Access Management. 

e. 
Improving landscaping and bu.ering, as follows: 


1. 
Bu.eryards between nonresidenal and residenal uses are .rst priority; 

2. 
Parking lot landscaping is second priority; 

3. 
Streetscape along arterials is third priority; and 

4. 
All other landscaping is fourth priority. 


f. Increasing the number of required parking spaces, if: 
1. 
The property has less than the required number of parking spaces; and 

2. 
The shortage of required parking is resulng in illegal parking or parking spillover onto nearby residenal streets. 


g. Improving lighng, as follows: 
1. 
All new lighng shall comply with Division 4-3-2, Ligh, is the .rst priority; 

2. 
Retro.ng exisng lighng .xtures to full cut-o. .xtures is the second priority; and 

3. 
Requiring proporonal lighng retro.ts in the most visible areas of a site is third priority. 


h. Addressing de.ciencies in site circulaon, loading, and o.-street parking space and parking aisle dimensions.

Division 6-1-5 Conversion of Nonconformi
Sec. 6-1-5-1 Purpose 
Many minor nonconforming uses have existed for a period of me, and some may have only recently become nonconforming. In many instances, minor nonconforming uses are integral parts of the City's fabric, that is, its character and funcon, so their connuing existence promotes the City's policy of protecng its character and neighborhoods. In these instances, the classi.caon "nonconformity" and resulng restricon on investment may not be what the community desires. As such, the use may be made "conforming" pursuant to this Division in order to remove the potenal sgma associated with the "nonconforming" designaon. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 6-1-5-2 Procedure 
A. Generally. An owner of a minor nonconforming use may apply for a condional use permit which has the e.ect of making the nonconforming use conforming. The criteria for condional use approval are set out in Secon 6-1-5-3, Criteria for Approval. 
B. Exclusions. This procedure does not apply to nonconforming lots, which may be buildable in accordance with the standards of Secon 6-1-3-4, Combinaonconforming Lots. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 6-1-5-3 Criteria for Approval 
A. Generally. A condional use approval may be granted to make a minor nonconforming use or a minor nonconforming accessory use conforming, if, in addion to the criteria for approval of a condional use set forth in Secon 2-2-2-2, Standards for All CondiUses, compliance with all of the criteria of this Secon is demonstrated. 
B. Minimal Nonconformity. The use or accessory use, as conducted and managed, has minimal nonconformies and has been integrated into the neighborhood's (or zone's if it is not in or adjacent to a residenal neighborhood) funcon, as evidenced by the following demonstraons: 
1. 
The neighborhood residents regularly patronize or are employed at the use (for nonresidenal uses in or abung residenal neighborhoods). 

2. 
Management pracces eliminate nuisances such as the spillover of noise and light, odors and appearance of waste materials and lier, unreasonably congested on-street parking, or comparable con.icts with abung and nearby properes. 

3. 
There is no material history of complaints about the use (a history of complaints is jus.caon for denying the condional use permit, unless the condions of the permit will eliminate the sources of the complaints). 

4. 
If the use is nonresidenal, it is licensed in accordance with the applicable ordinances of the City. 

5. 
The use has been maintained in good condion and its classi.caon as a nonconformity would be a disincenve for such maintenance. 


C. CondiCondions may be imposed relave to the expansion of bu.eryards, landscaping, or other site design provisions, or other limitaons necessary to ensure that, as a conforming use, the use will not become a nuisance. Such condions may relate to the lot, buildings, structures, or operaons of the use. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 6-1-5-4 E.ect and Annota
A. Generally. Uses that comply with the terms of a condional use permit issued in accordance with this Division are converted from "legally nonconforming uses" to "conforming uses" by virtue of the issuance of the condional use permit. Unlawful uses may not be made "conforming" under this Division. 
B. Wrien Approval. Condional use approvals shall be provided to the Applicant in wring and may be recorded by the Applicant at the Applicant's expense. 
C. AnnotaUpon granng a condional use permit and the Applicant's demonstraon of compliance with any condions placed upon it, the Administrator shall record the approval in the City's geographic informaon system .les.

1. 
Provides a palee of development styles and materials (as such, it addresses the design elements not the use or intensity of development); 

2. 
Provides details of streetscape design and landscaping; and 

3. 
May provide for speci.c modi.caons of the requirements of this LUDC in order to ensure that the development is a cohesive whole. 


B. Applica
1. An applicaon for paern book approval shall accompany: 
a. 
All applicaons for approval of a tradional neighborhood development (TND); and 

b.

C. 
Requirements and Limita


1. Harmony. A paern book shall present a palee of architectural styles that balances two connuums, both of which have ends that, at their extremes, are unaracve. The balance shall be struck between: 
a. 
Monotony and chaos; and 

b. 
Unity and interest. 


2. Quality. Quality refers to the materials and care with which a building or environment is built, as well as its visual richness (e.g., details that are aracve to the resident or visitor). In order to ensure visual interest, a paern book shall demonstrate the following: 
a. 
Dwelling units are designed to provide a uni.ed appearance from the street, with all street-facing elevaons (i.e., front façade and street side façade), having comparable treatment in materials, color, and trim. 

b. 
If masonry is used on a front elevaon, it is also applied to side elevaons in one or more of the following ways: 


1. 
Masonry returns to a break in the side elevaon, such as a chimney, room projecon, or projecng window area; 

2. 
An architectural return is applied to all corners so that the greater of 10 percent of the length of the side building wall or three feet is .nished with masonry to the same height as the front facade; 

3. 
Quoins are used, if consistent with the architectural typology of the building; 

4. 
An architectural detail with a minimum width of 16 inches is applied, such as a pilaster that caps the masonry and the other material that completes the corner; or 

5. 
A wing wall screens the view of the side of the building from the street. 


c. 
Detached single-family homes will be arculated and detailed, and shall avoid undue imposion of building mass on the street. 

d. 
There is detailing of doors, windows, and their trim that carries around the buildings' sides, so that even if the trim is plain, there is a visual relaonship to the general style and character of the front elevaon. 

e. 
Front porches will be provided on all detached housing types. 

f. 
Outdoor living space will be provided for each unit on all townhomes and mulfamily buildings. 

g. 
Ulity 	meters will not be on street-facing elevaons unless screened by vegetaon or other approved screening. 


3. Diversity. A paern book shall demonstrate that one or more of the techniques below will be used to achieve harmony (a paern book is not required to include all of these elements): 
a. 
Varied Housing Types at a Fine-Grained Scale. Mulple housing types are required, yet this requirement could result in areas or "pods" of each type, which has the potenal to lead to monotony. Mixing types on a smaller scale, even having di.ering dwelling unit types in a block face, is a technique to reduce monotony and add interest. 

b. 
Varied Architectural Styles. Di.erent architectural styles can be used to vary the appearance of buildings with comparable .oor plans. The variaons in architectural styles must be meaningful, but must not create a chaoc appearance. For this technique to be reviewed, a number of elements, including roof type and orientaon, roof pitch, eave overhangs, windows, doors, and decorave elements, shall be speci.ed for each architectural style that will be used in the development. The reference for architectural style is A Field Guide to American Houses by Virginia and Lee McAlester, et al. (Knopf 1984). 

c. 
Varied Floor Plans. If .oor plans are meaningfully di.erent, homes will look di.erent. If .oor plans are not meaningfully di.erent, homes will oen look monotonous. The di.erences in .oor plans must signi.cantly alter the width and shape in order to present a building volume or mass that is di.erent. Such di.erences include, but are not limited to: 


1. 
Obvious changes in the width of the front elevaon of the building; 

2. 
Di.erent forms (rectangle, L, or X shapes), if the di.erences a.ect the front façade; 

3. 
Di.erent numbers of stories; or 

4. 
Di.erent symmetry (symmetrical or asymmetrical). 


d. 
Varied Gable Orientaon. In many cases, a front or side gable roof can be constructed over the same .oor plan. This change signi.cantly alters the roof pro.le of the house, its front elevaon massing, and may also alter the height of the roof peak. 

e. 
Varied Elements. A paern book may demonstrate that architectural elements will be varied in a way that creates meaningful di.erences in building appearance. Such details may include trims, materials, color, window arrangement (grouping), window fenestraon, doors, door lights, window and garage doors, porches, chimneys, bay windows, cupolas, towers, and balconies, as necessary to create the required variaon. This technique is parcularly useful when a single architectural style, or two very closely related styles (e.g., Prairie and Crasman) are used in the development. A paern book must include detailed elevaons, lists of speci.c elements to be used, and an explanaon of how the elements will be mixed to di.erenate nearby buildings. 

f. 
Averaged Lot Width. Meaningful variaon of lot width generally causes meaningful variaons in building width and .oor plan. A paern book may show that street segments will include lots of varying widths, as follows: 


1. 
Three lot size categories for each type of housing are created, using a required average (e.g., 50 percent of the lots would be average, 25 percent small, and 25 percent large). 

2. 
The di.erence in frontage among the lot sizes should be in the range of 10 to 20 percent. For example, for an average 10,000 square foot lot that is 80 feet wide is 125 feet deep, the small lot could be 70 feet wide, and the large lot 90 feet wide. The resulng lots, all 125 feet deep, would have areas of 8,750, 10,000, and 11,250 square feet. 


4. 
Light and Air. The paern of development, and the open space available on each lot and for the community are such that adequate light and air are provided for residents. 

5. 
Pedestrian-Orienta. A paern book shall demonstrate that the residenal areas of the development are designed for the comfort and convenience of the pedestrian with connuous sidewalks; tree-lined, tra.c-calmed streets; and architecture that provides street-level interest and accessibility.

Division 6-3-10 Planned Developments 
Sec. 6-3-10-1 Purpose of Planned Development Zone; Threshold 
A. Generally. This LUDC is intended to provide .exibility to encourage innovaon in land development, to provide for a variety of housing types, and to protect natural resources. Sll, there may be circumstances in which the applicaon of di.erent standards to extraordinary development is appropriate. The purpose of the planned development (PD) zone is to allow for the development of project-speci.c standards in instances where it is demonstrated that a project of comparable quality and community bene.t cannot be approved in any other zone or combinaon of zones that are created by this LUDC. 
B. Purposes. In order that the public health, safety, integrity, and general welfare may be furthered in an era where innovaon and responsiveness in real estate development is oen needed to meet shiing market demands, the PD zone is established to provide project variety and diversity through the modi.caon of standards within this LUDC, so that maximum long-range neighborhood and community bene.ts can be gained for the following purposes: 
1. 
To encourage a paern of development that enhances the landscape in a manner which could not otherwise be accomplished using a di.erent zone, such that placement and construcon of buildings, hard surfaces, paths, roads, retaining walls, and new tree, tend to enhance the structure, natural assets, and unique landforms which are already present; 

2. 
To encourage major innovaons in residenal, commercial, recreaonal, and industrial development so that the demands of the populaon may be met by greater variety in type, design, and layout of buildings and by the conservaon and more e.cient use of open space ancillary to the development; 

3. 
To relate the type, design, and layout of residenal, commercial, recreaonal, and industrial development to the parcular site, preserving the site's natural characteriscs and resources in a manner which could not be accomplished using a di.erent zone; 

4. 
To implement changes in the technology of land development and service delivery which may not be ancipated by this LUDC, so that there are resulng public and private economic savings; 

5. 
To provide for necessary commercial, recreaonal, and educaonal facilies conveniently located in proximity to residenal uses; 

6. 
To lessen the burden of tra.c on streets and highways by internal trip capture, mulmodal linkages, and transit­supporve development; and 

7. 
To encourage integrated planning in order to achieve the above purposes. 


C. Threshold. No planned development zone shall be created unless it is demonstrated that the zone materially advances the purposes set out in this Secon. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 6-3-10-2 Contractual Agreements and Covenants 
A. Generally. 
1. 
A planned development (PD) zone approval constutes a rezoning and an agreement between the City and the owner(s) of the PD property for the development of the property in accordance with speci.c condions. These condions of approval shall be .led at the Department, and recorded at the o.ce of the County Clerk and Recorder aer each phase (if there is more than one) of the review process and approval. 

2. 
The use of the parcel, and the construcon, modi.caon, or alteraon of any use or structures within a PD project shall be governed by the PD approval and related condions, if any. The City may require that condions of approval be setout within recorded covenants. 

3. 
The Applicant / owner, any subsequent buyers, as well as enes created by the developer such as a homeowners' or property owners' associaon or an architectural review commiee, are subject to the condions of approval and terms of all recorded documents. 


B. Property Owners' Associan Required. A homeowners' or property owners' associaon shall be required for all PD's that are planned for more than one ownership within the PD. 
C. Required Disclosures. A seller of property within a PD zone shall apprise any buyer of the status, terms, and condions of a PD approval; the City bears no responsibility for any misrepresentaon of an approval by a seller or sellers' agent. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 6-3-10-3 Concurrent Subdivision Process 
A. Generally. It is the intent of this Division that subdivision requirements and review procedures will be carried out simultaneously with a PD applicaon process. 
B. Procedure. Development plans submied for subdivision within a PD zone shall meet the requirements for preliminary plats and .nal plats, as applicable, except that if a PD is proposed in an exisng subdivision and no changes are proposed in exisng lot boundaries, public rights-of-way or easements, and the proposed development will not require further subdivision of the original subdivision lot, no .nal plat shall be required. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 6-3-10-4 Planning and Design Requirements 
A. Generally. 
1. 
PD zones shall have a de.ned planning and design objecve that is based on the locaonal context and / or natural assets of the proposed PD zone (e.g., the protecon of a unique natural asset). 

2. 
PD zones shall provide linkages to abung development, if appropriate, and shall provide landscaped bu.ers along property lines in areas where such bu.ers are appropriate to ensure compability between the PD zone and the development on abung property. 

3. 
PD zones that are located within areas that are subject to design standards or guidelines or are in overlay zones shall be consistent with such standards or guidelines. 

4. 
The development approved through the use of the PD zone must be of higher quality than would otherwise be achieved through the applicaon of this LUDC. PD zones shall not be used to avoid the intent of requirements of this LUDC which provide for the protecon or enhancement of community character or the reducon of development impacts on nearby properes without providing community bene.t that more than o.sets the impacts of the development allowed with a PD. 


B. LUDC Design Objeces. Proposed PD zones shall meet the design objecves of Division 4-1-2, General Standards for Site Layout; Division 4-1-3, Site Layout for Speci.c Neighborhood Types; Secon 4-2-2-1, Street Design Objecs; Secon 4-2-3-1, Pedestrian System; and Secon 4-6-1-3, Landscaping Design Principles. 
C. Modi.caof Standards. Except as provided in Subsecon B., above, PD zones may be used to modify the development standards of this LUDC. However, standards of this LUDC which are not expressly modi.ed or modi.ed by necessary implicaon shall remain in e.ect within the PD zone. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 6-3-10-5 Planned Development Procedures 
A. Generally. Planned developments are approved in three steps: a conceptual development plan, a preliminary development plan, and a .nal development plan, as provided in this Secon. 
B. PD Rezoning ApplicaAn applicaon for a rezoning to a proposed PD zone shall be .led at the Department and processed as a rezoning. A conceptual development plan shall be submied with the applicaon, for which condions may be aached to the approval. 
C. Conceptual Development Plan. 
1. 
Purpose. The purpose of a conceptual development plan (CDP) is not to require in-depth site analysis, but to allow for review of the substance of the proposal to determine if the public and / or private bene.ts derived through the use of a PD zone jusfy the request. Generally, submial materials for a conceptual development plan need not exceed the requirements listed in Subsecon C.2., below. However, an Applicant may voluntarily submit, or the Administrator, Planning Commission, or City Council may request, more detailed informaon. 

2. 
Submial Requirements. A CDP applicaon shall be submied on a form approved by the Administrator, along with the applicable review fees. The applicaon shall include all items required for a rezoning, conceptual subdivision plan, and the following addional informaon: 


a. 
A conceptual development plan that shows the various exisng and proposed types of land uses, depicng their relaonship to each other and to surrounding uses. This plan should take the form of a "bubble" map, which locates proposed types of uses in an approximate fashion, including tentave circulaon diagrams and ancipated bu.ers or screening, rather than building footprints or precise street layouts. 

b. 
Designaons of proposed lighng zones within the PD (see Secon 4-3-2-2, LighZones), along with wrien jus.caon for the proposed light zones in each area. 

c.

1. 
The proposed name of the development. 

2. 
The approximate number of acres in each type of land use. 

3. 
The character and density of dwellings, structures, or uses on each poron of the property, which in the case of residenal buildings, may be based on the Housing Palee (see Division 3-2-2, Housing Palee) or an alternave palee proposed by the Applicant which provides at least the level of detail set out in Division 3­
2-2, Housing Palee, or a paern book. 

4. 
Jus.caon regarding why the proposed uses should be allowed in this locaon, at the proposed density and / or intensity, related in this manner to surrounding uses. 

5. 
Proposed phasing 	of the development, if any, and a general indicaon of the expected schedule of development. 

6. 
The projected impacts that build-out of the proposed PD zone will have on community facilies (e.g., schools, .re, police, ulies, streets, etc.), and what measures, if any, are included in the proposed development to address those impacts. 


3. 
Process. The CDP is reviewed using the standard development approval procedures of Division 6-3-3, Standard Development Approval Procedures. A CDP requires a public hearing approval, which is decided by the City Council aer recommendaon of the Planning Commission. 

4. 
Review Criteria. The CDP and accompanying documentaon will be used to determine whether the proposed PD meets the threshold required by Secon 6-3-10-1, Purpose of Planned Development Zone; Threshold. If the proposal meets the threshold, then further review shall occur. The CDP may be approved if it is demonstrated that it meets all of the following criteria: 


a. 
The proposed PD zone will further the objecves of the Comprehensive Plan and other adopted plans of the City. 

b. 
The proposed PD is compable with, or blends into, the development paerns and densies in the area, or establishes a more desirable paern in terms of implemenng City plans in an area that is in transion. 

c. 
If the proposed PD includes more than 100 dwelling units, it is within a reasonable distance to urbanized areas providing jobs, services, shopping, and community facilies, or it will provide such features within the PD. 

d. 
Adequate public services such as sewer, water, schools, roads, transit service, parks, .re, and police protecon will be available to serve the PD as the service demands occur. 

e. 
The design and proposed public and private amenies incorporated into the PD provide for a high quality environment. 

f. 
Streets that provide access to the proposed PD will have the capacity to serve the proposed PD at the me the impacts of the PD on the street system occur. 

g. 
Geologic hazard areas, steep slopes, visually prominent ridgelines, and natural resources are appropriately protected from the impacts of development, and long-term management is provided for these resources. 

h. 
The site design is energy e.cient, including the solar orientaon of the lots, and water-wise. 


5. E.ect of CDP Approval. Approval of a CDP has the following e.ect: 
a. Establishment of Residenal Density. 
1. 
A "speci.c density" (per gross acre) is established, which shall be recorded with the approved contractual documents; or 

2. 
A "design density" (per gross acre) is established, which sets a maximum density limit fully conngent upon evidence presented in subsequent submial materials which assures that the proposed density is appropriate. The "design density" approval constutes no commitment to the .nal approval of a "speci.c density." If a "design density" is approved, a "speci.c density" shall be established, as approved, at the 


preliminary development plan (PDP) stage. Approval of a CDP and its accompanying "design density" per gross acre shall not commit the City to approve the same density in a subsequent PDP. 
b. 
Establishment of General Layout and Design Concept. 	The CDP establishes the general layout and design concept for the PD zone. The subsequent applicaon for preliminary development plan (PDP) approval shall demonstrate consistency with the general layout and design concept. 

c. 
Vesng. PD Zoning shall vest only when a contractual document seng speci.c density, along with a .nal site speci.c development plan, has been approved for the PD zoned property, or part thereof, by the City Council at the second reading of the enacng ordinance. 

D. 
Preliminary Development Plan. 


1. 
Purpose. A preliminary development plan ("PDP") provides a detailed site layout for the PD zone. Like a preliminary subdivision plan, the PDP approval is the basis for approval of the .nal development plan, which is used as the basis for construcon permits. 

2. 
Establishing a "Speci.c Density." 


a. 
If a "design density" (but not a "speci.c density") is approved by a CDP, then the proposed density of the PD zone shall be jus.ed by the PDP. The City Council may approve a "speci.c density" that is more or less than a "design density" on all or any poron of a proposed PD, based on the quality of the design and the degree of its ancipated impacts. A Planning Commission recommendaon for approval of a PDP that contains residenal uses shall include a recommended "speci.c density" per gross acre. Upon approval by the City Council, the "speci.c density" of the PD shall be established and included in the approved contract documents to be recorded upon .nal approval of the PD. 

b. 
If the preliminary development plan is .led in phases, a "speci.c density" shall be assigned to each phase. Density at each preliminary phase shall be jus.ed by a speci.c design. Approved "speci.c density" from a phase which is not ulized when that phase is built-out may be carried over to another phase, so long as the approved character of the overall PD is not signi.cantly altered. However, in no case shall the total approved number of dwelling units in the PD zone be increased. 


3. Submial Requirements. A PDP applicaon shall be submied on a form approved by the Administrator, along with the applicable review fees, and shall include the following addional informaon: 
a. 
All materials and informaon required for a preliminary subdivision plan. (See Secon 6-3-6-3, Preliminary Plan.) 

b. 
A site plan illustrang each proposed building footprint, common open area, and public uses and facilies to be dedicated to the City and / or reserved in common ownership. 

c. 
Approximate locaons of all buildings, structures, and improvements, and open space, around buildings and structures. 

d. 
Conceptual elevaons and / or perspecve drawings of typical proposed structures and improvements (the drawings need not be the result of .nal architectural design, and need not be in .ne detail). 

e. 
A paern book, if the PD zone will depart from the standards set out in Division 3-2-2, Housing Palee, with respect to residenal development. 

f. 
A wrien statement describing the character 	of the PD, exterior building surface materials, landscaping features, and other aspects of the development which are used to jusfy the applicaon of the PD zone. 

g. 
The following plans, reports, and diagrams shall be submied, if applicable: 


1.

j. 
Names and addresses of all adjacent property owners within 300 feet of all boundaries of the property. 


4. 
Process. The PDP is reviewed using the standard development approval procedures of Division 6-3-3, Standard Development Approval Procedures. A PDP requires a public hearing approval, which is decided by the City Council aer recommendaon of the Planning Commission. The Administrator may suggest changes in the PDP throughout the review process. The City Council may delegate the decision-making authority for .nal development plans to the Administrator if it .nds that the PDP provides su.cient detail to make further review at public hearing unnecessary. 

5. 
Review Criteria. The PDP may be approved if it is demonstrated that: 


a. 
The PDP is consistent with the layout of the CDP, and carries out its purposes and design objecves. 

b. 
The PDP meets all of the criteria for approval of a CDP (see Subsecon C.4., above). 

c. 
The proposed public improvements meet the standards of the City's Development Standards and ConstrucSpeci.ca. 


6. E.ect of PDP Decision. 
a. 
Following the approval of a PDP, the Applicant may submit an applicaon for approval of a .nal development plan (FDP) and .nal subdivision plat in accordance with the approved development schedule. An approved PDP may be .nalized by more than one FDP and / or .nal subdivision plat. 

b. 
If the PDP is denied, the Applicant may resubmit an amended PDP to address the reasons why the PDP was denied. Such resubmial will not be considered a "substanally similar" applicaon for the purposes of Secon 6-3-3-14, Successive Applica

E. 
Final Development Plan. 


1. 
Purpose. The purpose of a .nal development plan is to .nalize the approved PDP, and provide documentaon for recording, which will control future development and use within the PD zone (or speci.ed area within the PD zone). 

2. 
Submial Requirements. An FDP applicaon shall be submied on a form approved by the Administrator, along with the applicable review fees, and shall include the following addional informaon:

Sec. 6-3-10-6 Development Schedules 
A. Generally. Planned development approvals shall include a development schedule during which the PD approval is e.ecve. If the Applicant or successors in interest fail to adhere to the development schedule, then the Administrator may take the steps set out in this Secon with respect to the PD, or if the PD is phased, the a.ected phase of the PD. 
B. Invesaep 1). First, the Administrator may make a wrien request of the record owner regarding the status of the project improvements, including improvements that are scheduled for compleon up to 30 days aer the date of the request. The record owner shall respond within 15 days of the date of the request. 
C. Status Decision (Step 2). Based on the response to the inquiry in Step 1 (Subsecon B., above), the Administrator shall take one of the following acons: 
1. 
If the record owner responds that the project will commence or reiniate construcon within 60 days from the date of the wrien status request, the City will maintain the PD in an acve status. The Administrator shall review the project .le and may request an update to any previously required submial informaon or documents (including the development schedule) prior to commencing construcon. If the record owner does not commence or reiniate construcon within 60 days of the Administrator's status request, then the Administrator shall automacally place the PD (or the incomplete poron thereof), on inacve status (see Subsecon D., below). 

2. 
If the 	record owner responds that the project is no longer feasible to commence or complete, then the Administrator shall schedule a public hearing before the Planning Commission and a public hearing before the City Council, in accordance with Division 6-3-3, Standard Development Approval Procedures, to consider whether: 


a. 
To retain the PD District (or that poron not completed), in which case the Administrator will place the PD on inacve status (see Subsecon D., below); or 

b. 
Iniate a rezoning ordinance to change the a.ected part of the PD District to a district that is consistent with the City's Comprehensive Plan and capital improvements program. If the property is rezoned, then within .ve 


working days of the second reading of the rezoning ordinance, the Administrator shall record a repeal of all a.ected PD plans, plats, and related documents in the public records of La Plata County. 
D. E.ect of Inace Status. 
1. 
A PD, or part thereof, which is placed on an inacve status maintains its development approvals, but does not have the present right to exercise them. In an inacve PD (or inacve area of a PD), no development, construcon or preparaon shall occur, and no building permits shall be issued, unl the PD is returned to an acve status. 

2. 
The owner of an inacve PD may apply for approval of a modi.caon of the PD according to the procedures set out in Secon 6-3-10-7, Modi.caof Planned Development Approvals, without .rst returning the PD to acve status. Modi.caon of the PD shall be according to the standards of the LUDC at the me of the modi.caon request, which may include requirements for consistency with updated plans and engineering and construcon standards. 

3. 
Inacve PDs shall be reviewed annually by the Administrator for their consistency with the Comprehensive Plan and LUDC provisions that apply to PDs, and for changed circumstances on the PD parcel and abung and nearby properes (physical and regulatory). 


a. 
If physical 	or regulatory condions have changed to such a degree that the project may no longer be appropriate as originally approved, the Administrator shall schedule a public hearing as in Subsecon C.2., above. 

b. 
Otherwise, the Administrator may automacally extend the inacve status for one year, up to a total of .ve years from the date of inacvaon. 


4. The Administrator shall nofy, in wring, the owner (or owners) of a PD property prior to any review or public hearing concerning the PD status. 
E. Change from Inace to Ace Status. An inacve PD may be changed to an acve PD as follows: 
1. The owner(s) shall make a wrien request to the Administrator to reacvate the PD project. The request shall: 
a. 
State the reasons for the delay of the project construcon; and 

b. 
Provide reasonable assurances that construcon will commence within 60 days of the PD's return to an acve status and be diligently pursued to compleon. 


2. 
The Administrator shall review the project .le and may request an update to any previously required submial informaon or documents (including the development schedule), and prior to changing the PD to acve status shall evaluate the PD for its compliance with the current Comprehensive Plan and LUDC regulaons that are applicable to PDs. 

3. 
The Administrator may change the status of the PD to "acve" upon .nding that the PD is consistent with the current Comprehensive Plan and LUDC regulaons that are applicable to PDs. Alternavely, the Administrator may refer the determinaon of status to the Planning Commission for decision at a public hearing. 

4. 
If the Administrator (or Planning Commission, as applicable) does not .nd that the PD is consistent with the current Comprehensive Plan or LUDC regulaons that are applicable to PDs, the Administrator shall nofy the Applicant regarding the .nding, and allow the Applicant not less than 120 days to propose modi.caons to the PD to bring it into compliance. 


F. Rezoning of Inace PDs. The Administrator shall iniate a rezoning ordinance from PD to a district that is consistent with the City's Comprehensive Plan and capital improvements program if: 
1. 
A PD (or part thereof) remains inacve, with no request for change from inacve to acve status or extension of inacve status, for a period of .ve years from the date of inacvaon or one year aer the e.ecve date of this LUDC, whichever is later; or 

2. 
An owner requests a change from inacve to acve status pursuant to Subsecon E., above, the Administrator (or Planning Commission, as applicable) does not .nd that the PD is consistent with the current Comprehensive Plan or LUDC regulaons that are applicable to PDs, and the Applicant fails to propose modi.caons to the PD to bring it into compliance within the me established by the Administrator.

Sec. 6-3-10-7 Modi.cavelopment Approvals 
A. Generally. Modi.caons of planned development approvals are processed in the same fashion as the original approvals, except as provided in Division 6-3-9, Modi.caand Correc, and except as provided in Subsecon B., below. 
B. Minor Modi.ca
1. Generally. A minor change to a recorded .nal FDP and / or related .nal plat, or related documents, may be approved by the Administrator as follows, provided that the modi.caons are required by engineering or development constraints or other factors not foreseen at the me the .nal development plan was approved. The phrase "minor change(s)" is considered to represent changes which do not alter the overall characteriscs of the total plan and which create no adverse impacts on adjacent uses or public services and facilies. Some examples of what can be considered as "minor changes" are (by way of illustraon and not limitaon): 
a. 
Changes in locaon and species of landscaping and/or bu.ering or screening, as long as the approved character and intent is maintained. 

b. 
Changes in the orientaon of porons of parking areas, as long as the e.ecveness of the approved overall site circulaon and parking is maintained.

1. 
To complement the scale of the land use. 

2. 
To provide an appropriate streetscape proporonal to the lot sizes allowed. 

3. 
To provide a certain character to an area based on the uses allowed. 

4. 
To provide for any interrelaonship between principal uses or principal and accessory uses. 

5. 
To provide desirable structure separaon from tra.c corridors and adjoining uses. 

6. 
To provide structure separaon required by adopted construcon/building codes.

Sec. 7-2-1-2 Gross Floor Area 
A. Generally. There are two measures of gross .oor area for the purposes of this LUDC: gross .oor area (generally) and gross .oor area (parking). They are measured according to the methodology of this Secon. 
B. Gross Floor Area (Generally). 
1. 
In general, gross .oor area ("GFA") is used to determine .oor area rao (FAR) for the purposes of evaluang the physical scale of a development. 

2. 
GFA is measured as the sum of the following areas, which shall not include areas iden.ed in Subsecon B.3., below: 


a. The area of the .oor planes of all above-grade .oors in buildings, measured within the boundaries of the outside building wall planes of the building story being measured. This area also includes, if present: 
1. 
Garage .oors; and 

2. 
Voids (e.g., stairwells and areas that are open to lower .oors). 


b. The area of the .oor planes of below-grade .oors in buildings, measured within the boundaries of the outside building wall planes of the below-grade .oors, if the exterior walls of the below-grade .oors are exposed to a height of at least three feet above adjacent grade. If only a poron of the walls are exposed to a height of at least three feet, then the poron of the .oor plane that is counted is equal to the area of the .oor plane mes the following quoent: 
1. 
The perimeter of the outside wall of the below-grade .oor that is exposed to a height of at least three feet above adjacent grade ("exposed perimeter"); divided by 

2. 
The total perimeter of the outside wall of the below-grade .oor. 


c. 
The area covered by carports. 

d. 
Areas, except carports, that are covered by a permanent roof or awning structure, if 50 percent or more of their perimeter is enclosed by walls (e.g., covered porches, balconies, paos, and breezeways). 


3. The following shall be excluded from the measurement of the areas that are iden.ed in Subsecon B.2., above: 
a. 
Non-habitable ac spaces. 

b. 
The areas of .oors in locaons where there is less than .ve feet of clearance between the .nished .oor and the ceiling. 

c. 
Parking structures for nonresidenal uses. 

C. 
Gross Floor Area (Parking). 


1. 
Gross .oor area (parking) is used for parking calculaons, as provided in Secon 4-5-2-2, Required O.-Street Parking Spaces (Parking Tables). 

2. 
Gross .oor area (parking), unless otherwise speci.ed by Secon 	4-5-2-2, Required O.-Street Parking Spaces (Parking Tables), is measured as the sum of the following areas: 


a. 
The area of the .oor planes of all .oors in buildings, measured within the boundaries of the inside building wall planes of the building story being measured, less that area on each .oor that is occupied by voids (e.g., elevator shas, except on the lowest .oor; areas open to lower .oors); and 

b. 
Outside areas that increase the intensity of the principal use in a comparable manner to indoor .oor area, such as outdoor and rooop dining areas and permanent outdoor merchandise displays. Courtyards, plazas, and other comparable areas are not included unless they are used as an acve extension of the principal use. 

D. 
Gross Leasable Area (Parking). 


1. 
Gross leasable area (parking) is used for parking calculaons, as provided in Secon 4-5-2-2, Required O.-Street Parking Spaces (Parking Tables). 

2.

E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 7-2-1-3 Building Coverage 
Building coverage is measured as the area of a lot or parcel which is occupied by principal and accessory buildings at ground level. For the purpose of this LUDC, building coverage is measured as the footprint of the principal and any accessory buildings at grade, including any carport (whether enclosed or not). Eaves 18 inches and less shall not be included in the measurement of building coverage. Overhangs, covered porches, and all decks are included in the measurement of building coverage. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 7-2-1-4 Lot Area 
Lot area is the area enclosed by lot lines. 
E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Sec. 7-2-1-5 Building Height 
A. Generally. There are three measurements of building height: wall plate height, overall height (or "building height"), and stories. They are measured as provided in this Secon. 
B. Wall Plate Height. Wall plate height is measured along each exterior wall of a building from the reference elevaon to the applicable wall plate height measurement line. 
1. 
Reference Eleva. The reference elevaon for the purposes of measuring wall height is the connuous .nished grade along the wall (or, in the case of building elements with wall planes that are inset from the exterior building walls, nearest to the face of the wall), provided that the .nished grade is not higher than necessary to provide posive drainage away from the building. Where addional .ll is used to raise the elevaon of the building for purposes other than drainage or required .ood protecon, such addional .ll shall not raise the elevaon of the reference elevaon. 

2. 
Wall Plate Height Measurement Line. 


a. For building walls under sloped roofs (except walls under gable ends, gambrel ends, barn hip ends, or shed roof ends), the wall plate height measurement line is the line or line segments at which the underside of the eave (or cornice, in the absence of an eave) meets the exterior building wall (the "wall height measurement line"). Hipped gable roof ends are considered "sloped roofs" for the purposes of this measurement. (See Figure 7-2-1­5A, Illustraall Height Under Sloped Roof Forms.) 
Figure 7-2-1-5A 
Illustrae Wall Height Under Sloped Roof Forms 


b. For building walls under gable ends (including symmetrical gables, saltbox gables, split gables, gambrels, and barn hips), the wall height measurement lines are the line segments that extend horizontally along the building wall in the direcon of the peak of the gable or center of the barn hip (as applicable): 
1. 
From the point at which the underside of the eave (or cornice, in the absence of an eave) meets the building wall at each end of the gable, gambrel, or barn hip roof form; 

2. 
To a point on a vercal line that intersects with the peak of the gable or gambrel or the centerline of the barn hip, as applicable to the roof form. (See Figure 7-2-1-5B, Illustraall Height Under Gable Ends.) 


Figure 7-2-1-5B Illustrae Wall Height Under Gable Ends 

c. For building walls under shed roof ends, the wall height measurement line is a line segment that extends horizontally along the building wall in the direcon of the ridge of the shed, from the point at which the underside of the eave (or cornice, in the absence of an eave) meets the building wall at the lower point of the shed, to a point on a vercal line that extends downward along the wall plane along the wall or corner closest to the ridge of the shed. (See Figure 7-2-1-5C, Illustraall Height Under Shed Roof Ends.) 
Figure 7-2-1-5C Illustrae Wall Height Under Shed Roof Ends 

d. For building walls under .at roofs, the wall height measurement line is a horizontal line that crosses the top of each parapet wall that is visible on the building facade or elevaon along which wall height is being measured. (See Figure 7-2-1-5D, Illustraall Height Under Flat Roofs.)

C. Overall Height. Overall height is measured for the enre building. 
1. Reference Plane. 
a. Height is calculated from the "warped plane" of the surface elevaon of the: 
1. 
Exisng grade, where no grading is proposed; or 

2. 
Finished grade, where such grade is not higher than necessary to provide posive drainage away from the building. However, where addional .ll is used to raise the elevaon of the building for purposes other than drainage or required .ood protecon, such addional .ll shall not raise the elevaon of the reference plane. 


b. The height plane may be measured from contours provided for a grading and drainage plan or other required plan that shows topography. Slopes between contour lines are assumed to be constant. 
2. Overall Height. Overall height is measured as the greatest vercal distance between the reference plane and the any point on the top of the building that is not exempt from building height measurement.

Illustrae Overall Height "Warped Plane" 


D. Stories. Stories are measured as follows: 
1. 
Story. A story is that poron of a building which is included between the upper surface of any .oor and the upper surface of the next .oor above or, in the case of the topmost story, the upper surface of the topmost .oor and the 

ceiling or roof above (unless it is a half-story, see Subsecon D.2., below). 

2. 
Half-Story. A half-story is a space under a sloping roof which has the line of intersecon of roof decking and exterior wall face not more than four feet above the top .oor level. 

3. 
Treatment of Areas Below Grade. If the .nished .oor level directly above a below-grade .oor or crawlspace is more than three feet above grade as de.ned herein for 50 percent or more of the total perimeter, or is nine feet or more above grade at any point, such below-grade area is counted as a story. 

4. 
Limita. If the vercal dimension of a story is more than 14 feet for the .rst story or 12 feet for an upper story, a half-story shall be added to the measurement of stories for each addional six feet, or fracon thereof, between .oors. If a topmost .oor does not have a ceiling, this limitaon does not apply unless the distance from the .oor to the top of the plate is greater than 12 feet. 


E. Excepo Building Height Measurement. 
1. 
The following building elements and appurtenances may cross the height planes, but only to the minimum degree necessary to achieve compliance with applicable building codes, or if not regulated by building codes, to provide for appropriate funcon: chimneys, vents (e.g., ac fans, cupola vents, radon migaon, plumbing vents, etc.), and light collecon domes for daylighng systems. 

2. 
In the RH, MU-A, CG, CR, BP, and LI zones, the following may extend up to 10 feet above the height plane, provided that, collecvely, they do not occupy more than 10 percent of the area of the roof (measured horizontally): non-habitable towers, spires, belfries, and domes; screened mechanical equipment; "green roof" vegetaon; roof access, elevator, and stair towers; and clock towers. 

3. 
Barns and silos in the RA zone are not subject to building height limits, provided that the buildings are set back at least one foot for each two feet of building height.

If the aachment is a wind turbine, the highest point is the top of the rotor at its highest point. 
C. Roofed Structures. The height of structures with roofs (e.g., gazebos) is measured as the distance from the lowest grade at the base of the structure to the top of the highest point on the structure, including aachments thereto. 
D. Fences, Walls, or Retaining Walls. 
1. 
Generally. The height of fences, walls, or retaining walls is measured as the vercal distance from a point of measurement at the average .nished grade for each interval on the outside of the enclosed area (or the side closest to the property line if the fence or wall does not enclose anything) to the highest point at the top of the fence or wall, excluding posts and pilasters. 

2. 
Measurement Intervals. In general, fence or wall height is measured in 40 foot horizontal intervals, or the distance between posts or pilasters, whichever is shorter. However, where the average .nished grade exceeds .ve percent 


(2.86 degrees), the horizontal interval between height measurements shall be equal to two divided by the slope, where the slope is expressed as rise divided by run. 
3. 
Posts and Pilasters. Fence posts or pilasters may exceed the height of the highest poron of the fence or wall that is connected to the post or pilaster by up to one foot. 

4. 
Arbors and Trellises connected to fences and walls may be permied to exceed the height limit by up to two feet (maximum height of eight feet) for a maximum width of eight feet.

3. Subdistricts. Two subdistricts are created within the RCOZ, as follows: 
a. Downtown Subdistrict. This Subdistrict recognizes the urban character and unique design consideraons of the Central Business District. The o.cial map showing the boundaries of the RCOZ subdistricts is on .le at the Community Development Department. A general locaon map of the Downtown Subdistrict is provided in Figure B, General Locawntown Subdistrict, River Corridor Overlay Zone. The Subdistrict includes:

E.ecve on: 7/1/2014 
Downtown Design Overlay Zone 

The downtown design overlay zone is established. Its purposes, boundaries, and subdistricts are as provided in this subsecon. 
A. Purpose. The purpose of the Downtown Design Overlay Zone ("DDOZ") is to provide for change and new development, while preserving and protecng the special character and identy of Durango's downtown area. Design standards that are applied within the DDOZ assure that new construcon, renovaon, or rehabilitaon within the Central Business District will be compable with, and will preserve and enhance the district's special character, a poron of which has been recognized as a Naonal Register Historic District. The design standards are based upon the exisng character of downtown as de.ned by the prevailing architecture, building materials, and urban design features. The design standards provide a range of design choices within each of the designated character areas (Main Avenue, Second Avenue, Camino del Rio) and encourage development that is compable and in context with the exisng or appropriate character of the area. The standards discourage the introducon of incompable elements of design or building style. 
B. Intent. It is not the intent of the DDOZ to return Durango to a bygone era, nor is it the intent to create an ar.cial atmosphere by incongruous aempts to replicate the past. Buildings teach us the technology and values of the era of their construcon. New buildings are compable in design but represent their own mes (as opposed to imitang buildings from previous eras), and serve as the historic record for future generaons. 
C. Subdistricts Established. The DDOZ is comprised of three subdistricts, which represent disnct character areas: 
1. 
The Main Avenue Character Area. The Main Avenue Character Area is the area south of 14th Street between the D&SNGRR right-of-way and the centerline of the alley east of Main Avenue (extended and abandoned), and also includes Buckley Park. 

2. 
The Second Avenue Character Area. The Second Avenue Character Area is the area south of the Animas River between the centerline of the alley east of Main Avenue (extended and abandoned) and the centerline of the alley east of East 2nd Avenue (extended and abandoned), and includes the most southerly property abung the west side of East Third Avenue, but excludes Buckley Park and the Smiley Building. 

3. 
The Camino del Rio Character Area. The Camino del Rio Character Area is the area from the Main Avenue Bridge to the Highway 160 Bridge, between the centerline of the Animas River to the D&SNGRR right-of-way, including the D&SNGRR Train Depot property and the areas north of 14th Street to the centerline of the alley east of Main Avenue (extended and abandoned).

1. The wildland-urban interface, (WUI), is a geographical area where structures and other human development meets or intermingles with wildland or vegetave fuels. The WUI creates a potenally dangerous situaon for .ames or embers from a wildland .re to come in contact with structures. The purpose of these Guidelines is to provide a means to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by establishing recommendaons for development within a Wildland-Urban Interface area in order to: a. reduce threats to life safety, property, and resources by improving development and construcon standards, access to and defensibility of developments, homes, and other property in WUI areas; b. minimize the potenal of spreading .re from wildland areas to structures and from structure .res to wildland areas; c. idenfy the appropriate use of cul-de-sacs, hammer head turnarounds, and turnouts on streets and roads providing legal and physical access to subdivisions with the intent to provide beer emergency access to remote areas; d. encourage homeowners and neighborhoods to plan, create and maintain defensible space that ulizes .re resistant construcon and landscaping; 2. Defensible Space is an area, either natural or manmade, where materials capable of allowing a .re to spread unchecked have been treated, cleared or modi.ed to slow the rate and intensity of wild.re and which create an area for .re suppression to occur. Consistent applicaon of these treatments will create condions where a crown .re could be transformed into a ground .re, slowing its rate of spread and creang an opportunity for .re suppression resources to safely respond. There are three Defensible Space Zones. a. Zone 1: An area measured 30 feet around the structure. The goal in this zone is to reduce the potenal home ignion sources. What is done now will greatly enhance structure survivability. Firewood and other debris around or under the structure should be relocated. Keep roof and rain-guers clear of needles and leaves during the .re season. i. Maintain non-combusble ground material 2 to 3 feet around structure (Planng beds, rock gardens, pavers, gravel or bare soil). ii. Remove all pine needles & .ammable ground materials. iii. Prune tree limbs and branches within 10 feet of the roof. iv. Remove tree limbs and branches within 10 feet of chimney. v. Use .re resistant construcon, plants and landscaping concepts in this zone. vi. Consider low combusble ground covers and non-.ammable landscape material. vii. Do not let .ammable vegetaon touch or overhang the home. 
viii. Ensure vegetaon is not a species that retains dead material or deposits excessive quanes of ground fuel. ix. Ensure vegetaon is located far enough away from the home so that they will not ignite the home by direct .ame contact or radiant heat emission. b. Zone 2: The size of this zone depends on the slope and property boundaries but is typically 75 to 125 feet from the structure. i. The fuel load should be reduced by removing dead trees and shrubs, thinning and pruning trees and keeping grasses to 6 inches or less. ii. Remove all ladder fuels. iii. Maintain 20 feet between crowns of nave trees or "clumps." iv. 20 feet between planng islands. v. Prune nave tree limbs 15 feet from ground. vi. Provide added protecon with "fuel breaks", such as driveways, gravel walkways, and lawns. vii. Provide access through fences for .re apparatus access to your remaining property. viii. Consider coordinaon with neighboring properes. ix. Store .rewood and other combusbles in this Zone. c. Zone 3 extends from the edge of Zone 2 to the property line and is an area of tradional forest management, enhancing the overall health of the forest. i. Remove heavy accumulaons of woody debris, such as piles of stem wood or branches. ii. Remove all ladder fuels. iii. Maintain 15 feet between crowns of nave trees or "clumps." iv. Prune nave tree limbs min. 8 to 15 feet from ground or 1/3 of crown, which ever is less. v. Coordinate with neighboring properes. vi. Treat enre perimeter of property. 3. Site Development a. Chimneys. Buildings and building sites are discouraged within ravines or other topographical features which constute ".re chimneys", and within 150 feet of the apex of ".re chimneys". Any proposed lot within a new subdivision with a ".re chimney" located on the lot should have a no-build area/zone designated on the face of the .nal plat for the subdivision that prohibits future development within ".re chimneys" and within 150 feet of the apex of ".re chimneys". b. Improvements Prior to Construcon. Water sources, wells, dra sites, hydrants, .re breaks, access routes, and other .re protecon equipment or features required by the preliminary plat approval should be installed prior to construcon of any residenal or commercial/industrial structures in a new subdivision. c. Fuelbreaks and Greenbelts. WUI .re protecon may rely on fuelbreaks and greenbelts to separate communies, groups of structures, or individual homes. These breaks can slow or stop the spread of an oncoming .re. i. Locate fuelbreaks and greenbelts to protect both exisng and planned developments and adjacent wildlands. Fuelbreaks should not be a bare soil trail bulldozed around a subdivision, but can be as simple as the removal of dead and fallen trees, tree limbs, shrubs, and other .ammable vegetaon together with breaking the connuity of vegetaon around the perimeter of the development. ii. Natural features such as rocky formaons with lile or no vegetaon or rivers or streambeds in which vegetaon has been thinned and dead and dying materials removed can also be ulized. 4. Construcon of Residenal, Commercial, or Accessory Structures. The construcon of new residenal, commercial, or accessory structures and the substanal improvement, relocaon, and replacement of exisng structures should consider .re resistant construcon techniques. 5. Means of Access The majority of non-.re.ghter deaths during wildland .res occurs during evacuaon or aempts to escape from a .re front. Access to developed areas requires that public and private roads, bridges, and driveways be properly constructed to provide for safe ingress and egress for .re personnel and equipment and the public. De.nions: Clumps means groups of trees where crowns are less than 10 feet apart. Crown means the outer edge of tree or "clumps" of trees. Pine needle removal means to rake only down to the decomposing layer to avoid erosion problems. Ladder fuels means vegetaon of di.erent heights, close enough to allow a surface .re to spread vercally to the top of a tree.
