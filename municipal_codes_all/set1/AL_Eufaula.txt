PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Eufaula, Alabama. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1974 Code, as supplemented through March 5, 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1974 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 10-1 and 10-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 10-1.5. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. 
CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE       SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to former Mayor Sam Slade, City Attorney Jimmy S. Calton, and City Clerk/Treasurer Linda W. Howell, CMC for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 1-8. - Amendments to Code. 
    All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion therein or, in the case of repealed chapters, sections and subsections or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby, and the subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed or omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time that this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new Code by the city council.

(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

Such officer or employee may have his own counsel to assist in the defense, at the expense of the officer or employee. 
(c)  Indemnification. Any officer or employee who is held liable for the payment of any claims or damages, by way of judgment or settlement, shall be entitled to indemnification by the city, where the acts resulting in such liability were done in good faith, without malice, within the scope of authority of the officer or employee. Any judgment rendered against an officer or employee, whether for compensatory or punitive damages, shall be presumed to have arisen from an act performed in good faith and without malice, provided that the act was performed within the scope of authority, and further provided that the city council does not find by resolution that the act was not performed in good faith or that the act was performed with malice.

(e)  Notice. The provisions of this section shall apply only where the city has been given notice of any action brought against any city officer or employee, based upon any action of such officer or employee within the scope of authority as such. 
(f)  Conflict of interest. Nothing in this section or in any ordinance of the city and nothing in any agreement with the city attorney shall be construed to require the city attorney to provide legal services in any manner which would cause the attorney to be involved in a conflict of interest. If the city attorney is not able to participate in the defense of an officer or employee because of a conflict of interest, the city council shall employ another attorney to provide such defense.

Sec. 2-341. - Property acquisition. 
(a)  It is the intent of the city council that the following procedures will be observed when acquiring capital assets: 
(1)  Land. Purchases of land must be approved by the city council after appropriate review of the proposed acquisition by the city attorney. Land acquisitions, the exchange of city property, or any combination thereof, may be made only after securing an independent appraisal, from a qualified appraiser, of the property to be acquired and, if applicable, the property to be exchanged. 
(2)  Structures and improvements to land. Decisions to acquire structures and other improvements shall, for existing improvements, be based on competent written independent appraisals when the cost exceeds $10,000.00. Acquisitions of existing structures and improvements valued at less than $10,000.00 shall be based on determinations of value compiled by the city engineer or city clerk as appropriate. Procurement of acquisitions to be constructed shall be based on competitive bids to the greatest extent practicable. 
(3)  Tangible personal property. Whenever acquiring tangible personal property, the mayor may pay the purchase price in full or may exchange similar property with the seller as a trade-in and apply the exchange allowance to the cost of the property acquired. If, whenever acquiring property, the mayor may best serve the public interest of the city by outright sale of the property to be replaced, rather than by exchange as a trade-in, he may make the sale in the manner otherwise prescribed in this policy statement for the disposal of property. 
(Ord. 1993-8, § 1, 6-21-93) 
Sec. 2-342. - Disposition of property. 
(a)  All dispositions of property belonging to the city, must be approved by the city council. The determination of property to be disposed of by the city council shall be at the election of the city council in the reasonable exercise of its discretion. 
(b)  Authority for the disposal of property shall be recorded in the minutes of the city. The disposal of tangible personal property shall be recorded in the records required by that section. 
(c)  The minimum procedures for disposing of property in the following categories shall be as follows: 
(1)  Land. The city council, in open meeting, may determine that certain land is surplus to the city's needs or should be exchanged for other land in the best interests of the city. Land so identified may be disposed of through competitive bids through public auction to the highest bidder. Land shall be exchanged or disposed of only after securing an independent appraisal from a qualified appraiser. Such appraisal shall become a public record of the city. 
(2)  Other tangible property. The city council shall have discretion to classify as surplus any of its property, which property is not otherwise lawfully disposed of, that is obsolete or the continued use of which is uneconomical or inefficient, or which serves no useful function. 
a.  Within the reasonable exercise of its discretion and having consideration for the best interest of the city, the value and condition of property classified as surplus, and the probability of such property being desired by the prospective bidders to whom offered, the city council first shall offer surplus property to other governmental units in the county. If no acceptable offer is received from a governmental unit, the property may be disposed of by competitive bid or by public auction. Such offer shall disclose the value and condition of the property. 
b.  Property, the value of which the city council estimates to be between $200.00 and $999.99, shall be sold only to the highest responsible bidder after a request for at least three bids, or by public auction. Any sale of property the value of which the city council estimates to be $1,000.00 or more shall be sold only to the highest responsible bidder, or by public auction, after publication of notice not less than one week nor more than two weeks prior to sale in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county and in additional newspapers if, in the judgment of the city council, the best interests of the city will be better served by the additional notices. 
c.  If the property is without commercial value it may be donated, destroyed, or abandoned. 
(Ord. 1993-8, § 1, 6-21-93) 
Sec. 2-343. - Accounting principles.

    Physical control means the immediate, continuous physical control of an animal at all times such as by means of a leash, or appropriate tether of such strength to restrain the same; or in the case of trained or obedient dogs, "physical control" shall also include visual signals or voice commands by the owner of a dog which responds to such signals or commands, if such dog is at all times in the immediate presence of and under the voice control of the owner or handler. Immediate presence, for the purpose of this article, shall be defined as a radius of 50 feet from the owner. 
    Running at large means any animal which is not controlled by any adequate leash or tether, or otherwise under the owner's physical control, as defined in this section, while the animal is off the owner's premises. No animal shall be deemed "running at large" when such animal is upon the property of the owner or upon property which the owner has permission for the dog to be on. Any words not specifically defined herein shall have their usual and common meanings. 
    A dog shall not be deemed to be "running at large" if any of the following apply: 
1.  The dog is confined in a building or fenced pen or yard on its owner's property or on the property of another person with the other person's consent.

Any dog apprehended during "sweep periods" not under leash restraint or in a private building, fenced run or fenced yard shall be subject to the provisions of section 14-95 of this article. 
    Tethering or chaining . These terms are commonly defined as fastening a dog to a stationary object or stake with a chain, rope or other such device that is attached to the dog's collar. This is often used as the sole means of keeping the animal restrained and under control. It does not refer to the periods when an animal is being walked on a leash. 
(Ord. 1993-17, § 1, 10-18-93; Ord. No. 2001-4, § II, 7-2-01; Ord. No. 2017-1 , 3-20-2017) 
Sec. 14-82A. - Tethering and chaining. 
(a)  Dogs and small animals are prohibited from being tethered or chained to a stationary or fixed point. Dogs and small animals are allowed to be confined by a trolley system, provided the owner is on the premises and certain requirements are met. 
(1)  No owner, keeper, harborer or maintainer of a dog may tether, fasten, chain or tie a dog to any permanent or temporary structure; any post attached to the ground or to any weight designed to restrict the dog's freedom of movement to a limited area of space. 
(2)  Dogs and small animals may be restrained by a trolley system or a tether attached to a pulley on a cable run, provided that the owner is on the premises and the following conditions are met: 
a.  Only one dog or small animal may be tethered to each cable run. 
b.  The tether must be attached to a properly fitting collar or harness worn by the dog or small animal, with enough room between the collar and the animal's throat through which two fingers may fit. Choke collars and pinch collars are strictly prohibited for purposes of tethering a dog or small animal to a cable run. The use of any collar too small for the size and age of the animal, or by any rope, chain or cord directly attached to the animal's neck is prohibited. 
c.  There must be a swivel on both ends of the tether to minimize tangling of the tether. 
d.  The tether and cable run must be of adequate size and strength to effectively restrain the dog or small animal. The size and weight of the tether must not be excessive, as determined by the enforcement officer, considering the age, size and health of the dog. In general, the use of a tether that exceeds 25 percent of the body weight of the dog or small animal is prohibited. 
e.  The cable run must be at least 15 feet in length and mounted at least four feet and no more than seven feet above ground level. 
f.  The length of the tether from the cable run to the animal's collar should allow access to the maximum available exercise area and should allow continuous access to food, water and shelter. 
g.  In no case shall it be permitted that a dog or small animal be confined so as to be forced to stand, sit or lie in its own excrement or on ground that is not well drained. 
h.  The trolley system must be of appropriate configuration to confine the dog or small animal to the owner's property, to prevent the tether from extending over an object or an edge that could result in injury or strangulation of the dog or small animal, and to prevent the tether from becoming entangled with other objects or animals. 
i.  Dogs and small animals shall not be confined through the use of a trolley system between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. 
j.  Unsterilized female dogs shall not be tethered attached to a trolley or cable run unless monitored by a competent adult for the duration of such tethering. 
k.  Dogs and small animals should never be tethered during natural disasters such as floods, fires, tornadoes, blizzards, or other severe weather. 
(Ord. No. 2017-1 , 3-20-2017) 
Sec. 14-83. - Rabies vaccinations; rabies vaccination tag required. 
(a)  Every person who owns, harbors, or keeps or maintains a dog or cat over the age of four (4) months shall secure on an annual basis a rabies vaccination for such animal, including the proper certificate and tag from a licensed veterinarian as long as the dog or cat is within the city. 
(b)  Each dog over the age of four months shall wear a substantial durable collar or harness, to which the vaccination tag shall be attached, provided however, that this requirement is exempted while such dog is confined to the property of the owner and provided further the owner shall be required to produce evidence of a rabies vaccination tag upon request of the ACO. It shall be unlawful to attach such tag by wire, rope or by any inhumane means. No person shall remove the collar or vaccination tag from any animal without the consent of the owner. It shall be a defense to any prosecution under this section for any dog owner to produce a written letter from a veterinarian stating that due to the size and shape of any properly vaccinated dog, a collar or harness will not stay on the particular dog without running the risk of undue injury to the dog or if it can be shown that such dog routinely wears a collar but the owner is unaware that the collar is off of the dog. 
(c)  Cats are not required to wear the rabies vaccination tag. If the rabies vaccination tag is not worn, the owner shall be required to produce evidence of the rabies vaccination tag upon request of the ACO. 
(d)  It shall be unlawful for any person to permit or allow any dog or cat in his charge or control to wear a rabies vaccination tag issued for a different animal. 
(Ord. 1993-17, § 1, 10-18-93; Ord. No. 1995-12, § 1, 8-21-95; Ord. No. 2017-1 , 3-20-2017) 
Sec. 14-84. - Animals at large. 
(a)  Constant physical control required. A dog owner shall keep his or her dog under "physical control" at all times. Any dog that is not under "physical control" shall be considered an "animal at large". 
(b)  Special requirements for designated areas. Including both sides of the street; the area bounded on the north by Browder Street and Highland Avenue, on the south by Barbour Street, on the west by Colby Avenue, and on the east by North Randolph Avenue, all the Central Business District and Old Creek Town. A dog owner shall keep his or her dog leashed whenever the dog is in these designated areas. 
(c)  Special requirements during sweep periods. The city council may, by duly adopted resolution, designate a "sweep period" for the apprehension of stray dogs. These periods shall not leave longer than seven days duration and shall not be of greater frequency than four times in any calendar year. 
(d)  Violation of this article. On the first incident, the ACO may return the dog to its owner, if ownership is known, and issue a warning or a citation to the owner in violation of this article. A citation shall be issued for subsequent violations. Penalties for violation of this article are prescribed in section 14-95. 
(e)  [Applicability.] This section shall not apply to police dogs when such dogs are engaged by a law enforcement agency in an official capacity.

Sec. 14-85. - Problem animals. 
(a)  Without regard to other provisions of this article or other sections of this Code, it shall be unlawful for owners of dogs and cats to allow, permit or by negligence fail to prevent such animals from acting or performing in such a manner as to cause damage or unsanitary conditions to the property of another, without the property owners' permission, public streets, public parks and recreation areas, or otherwise to cause a problem in the city. Acts deemed to be problems shall include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Any dog or cat entering any place where food is stored, prepared, served, or sold to the public except seeing-eye dogs while in the company of a blind person. 
(2)  Any dog while off its owner's property or off of property which the owner has permission for the dog to be on chases, runs after, or jumps at pedestrians or vehicles moving on public streets, sidewalks, public ways, and alleys. 
(3)  Any dog or cat urinating or defecating or defacing or digging up property not owned by the dog or cat's owner. 
(4)  Any dog frequently howling, yelping, whining, or barking in such manner as to unreasonably disturb any person or neighborhood. 
(5)  Any dog or cat feeding from, turning over, or otherwise disturbing garbage containers not on its owner's property. 
(6)  Any dog snapping, growling, snarling, jumping upon, or otherwise threatening persons lawfully using public sidewalks, streets, alleys, or public ways. The snapping, growling, snarling provisions shall not apply to dogs that are securely fenced in on the owner's property so that a reasonable person passing by would not perceive such conduct as an immediate threat to his safety or well being. 
(b)  A person who is offended by a "problem animal" shall call the ACO and report such offending animal. The ACO shall, upon receiving a complaint of a problem animal, investigate the report and if same is well founded, notify the animal owner of the complaint and request voluntary compliance of this article and report back to the person making the complaint. If requested by the complaining party, the ACO shall not divulge the name of the complaining party to the animal's owner. 
(c)  Any owner who has custody of or owns an animal whose conduct would be classified as a problem under this section and who has previously been notified by the ACO that his dog is a problem dog shall be dealt with in the same manner as provided for a violation of subsection 14-84(a). Any problem dog found running at large whose owner cannot be reasonably ascertained shall be taken directly to the pound. 
(Ord. 1993-17, § 1, 10-18-93) 
Sec. 14-85A. - Odor from dogs. 
    It shall be unlawful and a nuisance for any person to keep on any tract, lot, or premises within the city any dog or group of dogs, whether the same is housed in a fence, pen, kennel, building, or otherwise, under such circumstances that the odor from such keeping interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of adjacent or neighboring premises.

(Ord. No. 2017-1 , 3-20-2017) 
Sec. 14-86. - Classification of dangerous animals. 
(a)  When any person claims that an animal is "dangerous" as defined under section 14-82, he shall make a sworn statement before a sworn police officer of the city. Such statement shall specify the address or location of the alleged violation, the nature, time and date of the incident or acts, the name and address of the owner, if known, and a description of the animal, if known. Such statement shall be transmitted to the ACO. Upon receipt of such statement, the ACO shall immediately make an investigation, which such investigation must include an interview with the animal's owner if the owner can be located. The ACO is also authorized to initiate investigation for violations under this section arising under other circumstances. 
(b)  Upon a determination by the ACO that an animal is dangerous, the ACO shall make a summary of findings which shall be incorporated in writing in a classification document. The classification document shall order the owner to confine the animal in a substantial enclosure, or to securely muzzle the animal and otherwise contain it in a reasonable manner as specified by the ACO. 
(1)  The classification document shall be served upon the owner of the animal together with a copy of the procedure for appealing the classification. Service can be accomplished by hand delivery or by certified mail, return receipt requested.

The ACO shall within 20 days of receipt of such appeal, notify the owner of the time and place of a hearing before the committee. After conducting a hearing the committee shall take one of the following actions: uphold, modify, or revoke the classification.

The owner shall have the right to appear in person with or without legal counsel, and to put on any witnesses in defense to such classification. 
(Ord. 1993-17, § 1, 10-18-93) 
Sec. 14-87. - Dangerous animals. 
(a)  Violation. It shall be a violation of this article for any person to own, keep, maintain, harbor, or have custody of in the city any animal which the ACO or, upon appeal, the hearing committees or the city council, has classified dangerous, as defined under this section, unless such animal is securely muzzled or under restraint of a person by such means as specified in the classification document. 
(b)  Notification. All owners of animals classified dangerous shall immediately notify the ACO when such animal is loose or unconfined; has bitten a human being or attacked another animal; was sold; given away; died or moved to another address. 
(1)  Prior to a dangerous animal being sold or given away, the present owner shall provide the name, address, and phone number of the new owner to the ACO. The new owner shall execute a document to be supplied by the ACO acknowledging that such owner shall comply with the requirements of this article. 
(2)  As a condition to each animal's classification, each owner of a dangerous animal shall allow the ACO to enter and inspect the owner's premises to determine compliance with the classification document and this section.

(2)  Prior to the actual impoundment of any dog securely confined to an owner's property and prior to any destruction of any animal classified as dangerous under this article, the ACO shall seek from the circuit court of Barbour County, Alabama, a court order permitting the destruction of the animal. The complaint shall be an In Rem proceeding, with notice given to the dog's owner at least seven days prior to the date set for the hearing. The owner can appear at the hearing to produce evidence to show why such dog should not be destroyed. Appeal from the court order shall be as other appeals from the circuit court. The requirement to obtain a court order can be waived in writing by the owner, thus allowing the immediate destruction of the dog.

Intent to poison shall be presumed as a matter of law where poison is found mixed with any type of food. The finding of such poisonous substance or poisoned food, together with the proof as to the identity of the person exposing, depositing, or putting out same, shall be prima facie evidence of the intent to poison and destroy such animals.

(b)  No operator of a motor vehicle shall allow an animal to be unattended while in the vehicle unless the animal is securely restrained so that a reasonable person passing by would not perceive such animal as an immediate threat to his safety or well-being.

At that time the city governing body shall determine whether the building, structure, part of building or structure, party wall, or foundation constitutes a public nuisance. Should the city governing body find by resolution that the building, structure, part of building or structure, party wall, or foundation is a public nuisance, then the appropriate city official shall give the person or persons, firm, association, or corporation last assessing the property for state taxes, by certified or registered mail to the address on file in the revenue commissioner's office, notice to remedy the unsafe or dangerous condition of the building or structure, or to demolish the same, within a reasonable time set out in the notice, which time shall not be less than 30 days unless an extension is granted by the appropriate city official or suffer the building or structure to be demolished by the city and the cost thereof assessed against the property.

The cost of the demolition shall be the actual cost the city incurs in the demolition should the city use its own forces, including administrative costs the city incurs in abating the nuisance. Should the city contract for demolition, the cost shall be the actual cost the contractor charges the city for the demolition, including administrative costs the city incurs in abating the nuisance. Upon the report of the costs by the appropriate city official, the governing body shall adopt a resolution fixing the costs which it finds were incurred in the demolition and assessing the same against the property; provided, however, the proceeds of any moneys received from the use of salvaged materials from the building or structure shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition; and provided, further, then any person, firm, or corporation having an interest in the property may be heard at the meeting concerning the fixing of the costs or the amounts thereof. The city clerk shall give at least ten days' notice of the meeting at which the fixing of the costs is to be considered by first-class mail to all entities having an interest in the property whose address and interest is determined from the revenue commissioner's records on the property or is otherwise known to the clerk.

The assessment shall then be added to the tax bill of the property, collected as a tax, and remitted to the city.

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 46-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Alabama has in Title 11, Chapter 19, Sections 1-24; Chapter 45, Sections 1-11; Chapter 52, Sections 1-84; and Title 41, Chapter 9, Section 166 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the City of Eufaula, Alabama, does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 2009-6, § 2, 8-3-09) 
Sec. 46-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Eufaula, Alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 2009-6, § 2, 8-3-09) 
Sec. 46-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protection barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
(Ord. No. 2009-6, § 2, 8-3-09) 
Sec. 46-4. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this chapter are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

(Ord. No. 2009-6, § 2, 8-3-09) 
Sec. 46-72. - Specific standards. 
    In ALL areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of article IV, subsection 46-71(4), "Elevated buildings." 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any non-residential structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in article III, subsection 46-53(6). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed and substantially improved on: (i) individual lots or parcels, (ii) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (iii) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (iv) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed and substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
2.  Where no base flood elevation exists, the manufactured home chassis and supporting equipment is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength and is elevated to a maximum of 60 inches (five feet) above grade.

(Ord. No. 2009-6, § 2, 8-3-09) 
Sec. 46-73. - Floodways. 
    Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in article II, section 46-22, are areas designated as floodway[s]. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point; 
(2)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the adopted regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; 
(3)  A community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of section 65.12, and receives the approval of the administrator. 
(4)  Require, until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
(5)  ONLY if article IV, subsection 46-73(2), (3) or (4), above, are satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article IV. 
(Ord. No. 2009-6, § 2, 8-3-09) 
Sec. 46-74. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations (Approximate A zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in article II, section 46-22, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (Approximate A zones), the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with article II, section 46-22, then the building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of article IV. ONLY if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (4) shall apply: 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  All development in zone A must meet the requirements of article IV, section 46-71 and subsections 46-72(1)-(4). 
(4)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Also, in the absence of a base flood elevation, a manufactured home must also meet the elevation requirements of article IV, section 46-72, paragraph (3)b.2., in that the structure must be elevated to a maximum of 60 inches (five feet). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of article IV, subsection 46-71(4), "Elevated buildings." 
The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(Ord. No. 2009-6, § 2, 8-3-09) 
Sec. 46-75. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in article II, section 46-22, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of article IV, subsection 46-71(4), "Elevated buildings." 
The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction and the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level or two feet (if no map elevation is listed), above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in article III, subsections 46-52(1)c. and (2). 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

ARTICLE V. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES 

Sec. 46-91. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The board of adjustment as established by the city council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustment may appeal such decision to the circuit court, as provided in [the] Alabama Code. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if ANY increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued ONLY when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The building department shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs/Office of Water Resources upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

    New construction means ANY structure (see definition) for which the "start of construction" commenced after January 15, 1988 and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure. [*i.e., the effective date of the FIRST floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for community participation in the (NFIP)] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after January 15, 1988. 
    Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damages occurred. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Section 1316 means no new flood insurance shall be provided for any property which the administrator finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority, or other authorized public body, to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations or ordinances which are intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas. 
    Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure.

    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damages occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the building should be: 
(1)  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
(2)  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's flood plain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 44, Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) and corresponding parts of this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Sec. 66-328. - Open burning regulations. 
(a)  Purpose. This section is enacted to protect, preserve, and promote the health, safety, welfare, and peace for the citizens of Eufaula, Alabama, through the control of open burning. It is the intent of this section to establish standards that will control open burning so that it will comply with all applicable state regulations and will not be detrimental to individuals and the community in the enjoyment of life, property and conduct of business. This section is not intended to supersede legislation or regulations of statewide applicability governing open burning nor does compliance with this section guarantee compliance with such legislation or regulations. 
(b)  Open burning standards. 
(1)  No person shall kindle or maintain any open fire at any location or time without a permit from the City of Eufaula Fire Department. Open burning may be conducted for the purposes listed below and if it meets all the requirements of this paragraph. Authority to conduct open burning under the provisions of this paragraph does not exempt or excuse a person from the consequences, damages, or injuries which may result from such conduct, nor does it exempt or excuse a person from complying with all applicable laws, ordinances, regulations and orders of governmental entities having jurisdiction, even though the open burning is conducted as specified in this paragraph. 
(2)  Conditions under which this permit is valid. Permits may only be issued if the proposed burning meets the following criteria: 
a.  Open burning of vegetation or untreated wood may be conducted if it is generated by clearing or maintaining land, or from demolition or operations conducted for any of the following purposes: 
1.  Erection of any structure; 
2.  Construction of any transportation, utility, or communications line; 
3.  Maintenance of rights-of-way; 
4.  Development or modification of a recreational or commercial area; 
5.  Plant husbandry practices. 
b.  Open burning authorized by this paragraph shall comply with the following conditions: 
1.  The burning must take place on the property on which the combustible fuel originates; 
2.  The location of the burning must be at least 500 feet from the nearest occupied dwelling other than a dwelling located on the property on which the burning is conducted in which case the fire must be at least 100 feet from any structure on the owner's property. 
3.  The burning must be controlled so as to avoid creating a traffic hazard on any public road, street, or highway as a result of the air contaminants emitted; 
4.  Initial burning may be commenced only between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. and must be fully extinguished by 5:00 p.m. 
5.  Burning shall be conducted only when there is good ventilation and when the prevailing wind direction is away from any built-up area in the vicinity. No burning shall be conducted in areas under a current air stagnation advisory issued by the National Weather Service or during a "drought emergency" declared by the governor; or during a period when winds are forecast to be in excess of 10 m.p.h. 
6.  The fire shall be attended at all times. 
7.  The fire chief or his authorized representative may impose additional conditions to cover specific open burning situations when additional controls or requirements are deemed necessary to minimize air pollution. 
8.  The fire shall be on the premises owned or otherwise under the control of the person obtaining permit. 
9.  Only vegetation and untreated wood may be burned. It is unauthorized to burn heavy oils, asphalt products, plastics, vinyl materials, insulation, paper, cardboard, natural or synthetic rubber, salvage or scrap materials, chemicals, garbage, treated or painted wood, or any trash. 
10.  The materials to be burned will be raked into piles on clear ground or the fire will be contained in an approved waste burner. 
11.  The burning will be under constant supervision by sufficient adults who will have one or more 5/8 ;inch; or larger garden hoses or other approved extinguishing devices at hand to completely extinguish the fire at any time. The ashes shall be wet down or covered with earth to prevent rekindle. 
12.  Only one fire shall be in progress at any time. Size of pile: Six feet to ten feet in diameter, protected by two 5/8 ;inch; or larger garden hoses ready for use. Five feet or less in diameter, protected by one 5/8 ;inch; or larger garden hose ready for use. 
13.  Burning off of land will also require a state burn permit from the forestry service if the area is in excess of 1/4 acre. The land must be prepared before burning to insure that the burning can be kept under control. Fire breaks must be adequate to prevent the fire from spreading. Smoldering piles left unattended shall be adequately protected against fire spread and undue smoke emissions. The fire department must be notified in advance that the burning is being consummated. 
14.  If the fire official determines that burning within 100 feet of a structure or of mountainous, brushy or grass covered areas will create an undue fire hazard no burning will be permitted. 
(c)  Exceptions from section. This section shall not be applicable to the following: 
(1)  Open fires for the cooking of food for human consumption on other than commercial premises; 
(2)  Fires for recreational or ceremonial purposes; 
(3)  Fires to abate a fire hazard, providing the hazard is so declared by the fire department or fire district having jurisdiction; 
(4)  Fires for prevention or control of disease or pests if approved in writing by the fire chief or his designee; 
(5)  Fires for training personnel in the methods of fighting fires, provided that all requirements of ADEM Admin. Code R.335-3-11-02(12) are met;

Code Chapter 335-14-17) as fuel, and used by construction or other workers or home owners/tenants for heating or asthetic purposes; 
(d)  Revocation of burning permits. The fire chief, fire official, or mayor, may revoke a burning permit issued by the City of Eufaula any time after it is issued if the open burning creates a danger or serious nuisance for individuals or property. 
(e)  Violations of burning provisions. Any person or persons found to be in violation of this open burning section shall extinguish the fire and shall be issued a citation and may be fined up to $25.00 for first violation and up to $100.00 for a second violation.

If no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewer works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample shall be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.

ARTICLE FOUR
NONCONFORMING LOTS, NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND, NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES, NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES, AND NONCONFORMING CHARACTERISTICS OF USE
Section 4.1. Continuance of Nonconforming Uses
Within the districts established by this ordinance, or amendments that may later be adopted, there may exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were unlawful before this ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendment. It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
4.11. Extension of Nonconformities: Nonconforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this ordinance by attachment of a building or premises, or by the addition of other uses, of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved.
4.12. Construction Prior to Adoption: To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently.
4.121. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner.
4.122. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on in accordance with Section 4.121 within thirty (30) days of adoption of this ordinance.
4.123. Continuation. Any nonconforming use may be continued indefinitely although such use does not conform to the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. Unless specifically provided by the Board of Adjustment for a particular use, no change in title or possession or any other change in status of a property on which a nonconforming use exists shall prevent the continuance of such nonconforming uses.
Section 4.2. Nonconforming Lots of Record
In any district in which single family dwellings are permitted a single family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
12
provisions of this ordinance but subject to the limitations imposed by this section. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located, provided further that in the event said lot is not serviced by a sanitary sewer, a certificate of approval as to the suitability of said lot for a septic tank is first obtained from the appropriate health authority. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Adjustment.
4.21. If, however, the owner of two or more adjoining lots each of which is insufficient in land dimensions decides to build on or to sell one of these lots, he must first combine lots to comply with the dimensional requirements of the ordinance. The Board of Adjustment may, by variance, reduce or waive the yard requirements on nonconforming lots where enforcement of the yard requirements would create an excessively small or narrow building area. The Board shall, in its deliberations on appeal for a variance, take into consideration typical lot sized and existing yards in the general area where the nonconforming lot is located, giving particular attention to existing uses and setbacks on adjacent property.
Section 4.3. Nonconforming Uses of Land
Where at the time of passage of this ordinance lawful use of land other than lots provided for in Section 4.2, infra, exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this ordinance, and where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding $1,000, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
4.31. Extension of Nonconforming Use: No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.
4.32. Relocation of Nonconforming Use: No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.
4.33. Discontinuance of Nonconforming Use: If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 120 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance for the district in which such land is located.
4.34. Additional Structures: No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
Section 4.4. Nonconforming Structures
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by reason of not being in the proper district, restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
13
4.41. Extension of Nonconforming Structure: No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
4.42. Replacement and/or Tearing Down of Nonconforming Structure: Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed or damaged by any means exceeding its full value above foundation for ad valorem tax purposes it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. If the structure cannot be reconstructed or repaired because of the application of this Article, it shall be the owner's responsibility to demolish said structure and to remove all debris within the sooner of 180 days of the date the structure was damaged or destroyed or within 120 days of the date the Board of Adjustment denies a building permit.
4.43. Relocation of Nonconforming Structure: Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
4.44. Existing Nonconforming Mobile Home: Such mobile home may be replaced, subject to requirements of Section 5.239.
Section 4.5. Nonconforming Uses of Structures or of Structures and Premises in Combination
If a lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of $1,000 or more, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
4.51.

In addition to such permitted compatible uses, however, there are certain other uses which may be necessary or desirable to allow in certain locations in certain districts, but because of their actual or potential impact on neighboring uses or public facilities, need to be carefully regulated with respect to their location for the protection of the City of Eufaula. Such uses, on account of their peculiar locational need or the nature of the service offered, may have to be established in a district in which they cannot be reasonably allowed as a permitted use.
54
6.31. Authority to Grant Permits
The Board of Adjustments as hereinafter provided shall have the authority to grant special use permits, subject to such conditions of design, operation, and safeguards as they may determine for all special uses specified in the various district provisions of this Ordinance.

(a). Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general objectives, intent, and purposes of this ordinance.
(b). Will be designed, constructed, operated, maintained, and managed so as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with existing or intended character of the general area.

When granting a special use permit, the Board of Adjustments shall require such conditions of use as it deems necessary to protect the best interest of the City and the surrounding property, and to achieve the objectives of this ordinance.
6.37. Approval, Grant or Permit
Upon holding a public hearing and the finds that the requirements of this subsection of this ordinance have or have not been satisfactorily met by the applicant, the Board of Adjustments shall within thirty (30) days approve or disapprove the application, If approved, a Special Use Permit shall be issued to the applicant. The Board of Adjustments shall forward a copy of the permit to the applicant, City Clerk, Zoning Administrator, and City Council.
Failure to act within thirty (30) days shall be interpreted as approval by default and notice of such occurrence shall be forwarded to the Council with their copy of the permit. The Board of Adjustments may extend the review period for not more than fifteen (15) days, by giving written notice to the applicant, for the purposes of collecting additional data which will be significant in reaching a final decision.
The Administrator shall not issue a building permit until he has received a copy of the Special Use Permit approved by the Board of Adjustment.

5). Landscaping Requirements:
a. Landscaping Percentage Requirements. Any building site meeting the requirements of this section shall be landscaped. Landscaping materials shall cover fifteen (15) percent of the total building site as determined first by calculating the square footage of the unimproved site, then subtracting therefrom the total square footage of the building area. At least 60% of the landscape requirements shall be located in the front set back defined as the area between the property line and the building wall(s) facing the public right-of-way.
To determine the number of shade trees required on any building lot, first add the length of all sides of the lot then divide the total by 30. If the result ends in a fraction, the result as expressed in numbers shall be rounded off to the next highest whole number to arrive at the total number of shade trees required. No less than one half, rounded to the next highest whole number, of the required trees shall be large shade trees.
With the exception of building sites where the developer increases the square footage of the building by fifty (50) percent or more, the developer/owner must reserve the first twenty (20) feet of the front yard setback requirement of the zoning district for a green space where at least one large shade tree shall be planted for every thirty feet of road frontage, with the exception of where primary power lines occur. In these areas, small shade trees are allowed.
Planted trees must have a 1 ½ - 2 caliper. All planted trees immediately become desirable trees. After the application of credits the City Horticulturist may waive any number of trees not required due to site characteristics. If waived, these trees shall then be donated to the City Horticulturist to be planted as public trees.
b. Parking lot landscaping shall be provided in parking lot use areas having uncovered parking at street level. Such landscaping shall be provided in such a manner as to break up the expanse of paving, facilitate the safe circulation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and provide shade
62
valuable for pedestrians and/or vehicles. A ratio of one large shade tree for every ten (10) parking spaces shall be required.
c. Site Visibility:
Landscape material shall not obstruct traffic visibility at intersections, parking lot interiors and driveway entrances between heights of three (3) and eight (8) feet above grade. Existing trees must be pruned so that they do not obstruct traffic visibility at intersections and driveway entrances.
d. Spacing:
Trees shall not be planted closer than 4.5 feet to curbs or barriers protecting trees. Large shade trees shall not be planted closer than thirty (30) feet of each other and small shade trees a minimum of ten (10) to a maximum of twenty (20) feet of each other where possible.
e. Installation:
All plant material shall be installed in a sound manner and in accordance with the landscape plan. This installation process shall be included on the landscape plan to be approved by the city horticulturist. No large shade trees shall be planted within twenty (20) feet of the centerline of primary utility lines.
f. Maintenance:
Landscaped areas shall be maintained by the owner or lessee of the property at all times. This includes prompt replacement of all dead or damaged landscape material to insure continued compliance with landscaping requirements. This also applies to rights-of-way or medians for developers who elect to take credits for landscaping requirements here.
g. Water Supply:
All landscape areas need to be readily accessible to an adequate water supply located on the development parcel. This may include one or more of the following: hose bibs, automatic or manual irrigation, and/or any other appropriate method of supplying water to the landscape areas.
h. Protection of Landscaped Areas:
Landscaped areas are to be protected by concrete curbs, wheel stops, continuous border plants of hedgerows, railroad ties or other suitable barriers and landscape areas shall be detailed on the landscape plan.
i. Performance Guarantee of Completion:
The owner shall be responsible for ensuring that either he or his designated builder provides all required greenspace to the lot. This may be accomplished by the full installation of all required improvements at the time that the certification of occupancy is approved by the Horticulturist. In lieu of requiring the completion of all improvements prior to opening (if opening is to occur between the dates of June 1st and October 31st), the Horticulturist and/or Tree Commission, may, at its discretion, accept from the owner or his designated builder a cash deposit or a letter of credit from a F.D.I.C. bank. The cash deposit or F.D.I.C. bank letter of credit for the construction and installation of improvements shall be in accordance with the preliminary plans approved by the Horticulturist and meet the following requirements:
A) Value of Bond. The Performance Bond shall be in an amount not less than one hundred twenty-five (125%) percent of the cost of the remaining improvement(s) identified on the landscape plan. The bond shall be payable to the City and shall be in an amount established by
63
the Horticulturist and/or by the Tree Commission as sufficient to cover the entire cost of all remaining improvements, as estimated by the applicant, reviewed and recommended by the landscape contractor and approved by the Horticulturist and/or Tree Commission.
B) Value of Cash deposit or F.D.I.C. Bank Letter of Credit. A cash or escrow deposit shall be in an amount not less than one hundred twenty five (125%) percent of the entire cost of all remaining improvements. Said full amount shall be estimated by the applicant, revised and recommended by the Landscape Contractor and approved by the Horticulturist and/or Tree Commission.
To Complete Work. If within six (6) months after filing the performance bond and establishing the case account or providing F.D.I.C bank letter of credit, the owner/builder has not completed all necessary improvements; or if, in the opinion of the Horticulturist and/or Tree Commission, the improvements have not been satisfactorily installed, the cash account or F.D.I.C. bank letter of credit shall be used by the City of Eufaula to complete the improvements in satisfactory fashion, or the City may take steps as may be necessary to require performance under the bond. Any funds remaining after all work has been satisfactorily completed will be returned to the owner or his designated builder.
The landscape contractor who estimated the cost of the work may be hired, if he is still willing to perform the work, to install the improvements as specified by the approved plans. As soon as feasible after the six-month time extension has expired, the landscape contractor, at the direction of the City, will begin improvements. In the event the landscape contractor who provided the work is not willing for any reason to install the improvements as specified by the approved plans for the amount of his original estimate, the City Horticulturist will then bid out the job. The landscape contractor will be paid from the bond fund.
6). Existing Tree Credits:
Credit will be given for the retention and protection of any existing trees that are a desirable species, have good form, and are in healthy condition. Credit will not be allowed if proper protection is not maintained throughout the construction process. These tree credits can go toward landscape requirements; however, the front setback must contain one desirable tree for every thirty (30) feet of frontage. If any existing tree for which credit is received dies or fails to thrive, the owner must replace the number of trees credited for which credit was given. Tree equivalents shall be credited as follows:
EXISTING TREE NOT REQUIRED TO PLANT
DIAMETER OF EXISTING TREE
(AT FOUR AND ONE-HALF FEET
ABOVE GRADE) TREE CREDITS:
6 1 Tree
12 2 Trees
18 3 Trees
24 4 Trees
30 5 Trees
36 6 Trees
42 7 Trees
64
7). Tree Protection During Construction
Every attempt shall be made to protect and save existing trees on a development site, except for those trees removed to allow for the erection of the building and/or improvements.
If a tree or group of trees are to be retained on the site for Tree Credits, a tree protection barrier system approved by the City Horticulturist and/or Tree Commission must be constructed and maintained throughout the construction process to protect the Critical Root Zone(s). Refer to the Tree Protection During Construction Booklet provided by the City of Eufaula Horticulture Department or Building Department for strategies to maintain proper protection.
8). Protection of Natural Areas:
Areas of undisturbed, desirable trees and vegetation may be designated as Natural Areas. Individual Natural Areas must be a minimum of one-tenth (0.1) acre. Natural Areas will be credited against overall fifteen (15%) percent landscaping requirements, and property owner can elect to install a minimum twelve (12) foot green space in setback instead of the required twenty (20) foot green space and setback. Credit will not be allowed if proper protection of the Critical Root Zone of the Natural Area is not maintained throughout the construction process. Refer to the Tree Protection During Construction Booklet provided by the City of Eufaula Horticulture or Building Department for strategies to maintain proper protection. Loss of Natural Area due to significant tree decline or tree death will require the owner to replace the amount of credited trees lost using the tree credit formula above. Replacement trees will be planted throughout all setbacks and within the former Natural Area.

Section 6.63. Buffer/Screening Requirement
1.) Purpose
The purpose of this section is to protect residential land uses from noise, glare of lights and signs, odor, debris, and visual encroachment of adjacent commercial, manufacturing, or multifamily uses.
2.) Application of Section 6.63
The requirements of this section shall apply to any commercial, manufacturing, or multifamily land use that abuts a residential land use. Where residential development occurs in districts not zoned residential the requirements still apply. The requirements do not apply when land that is zoned FAR is used for agriculture or forestry.
3.) Buffers
A buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip of land at least thirty feet wide, established along the entire length of and contiguous to the designated property line or lines. Buffers shall be grassed or mulched unless ground cover is already established. All requirements of Section 6.61 shall apply to buffers.
4.) Vegetative Screening
Vegetative screen planting is required in buffers to reduce or eliminate nuisances created by incompatible land uses. Such planting shall be so designed, planted, and maintained as to create a visually unbroken barrier at least six feet tall within two years of planting. Any plants that die within said two-year period shall be promptly replaced. As to those plants, a new two-year time frame shall begin for them to reach six feet tall. Plants shall be arranged in such a manner as to provide a variety of plant materials and spacing so that straight single-species rows are minimized. A list of recommended plants will be available from the city Building Department or Horticulturist.
6.631. Exception
When a proposed multifamily development will abut an existing multifamily land use the required buffer will be a minimum of twenty feet. No vegetative screen planting is required. Instead, one large shade tree per every thirty linear feet, or portion thereof, of the adjacent property line or lines is required.
68
In the case of existing development or any nonconforming lot where the provision of the thirty foot screened buffer precludes the reasonable use of the property, upon approval of the Zoning Administrator and the Mayor, a wall or fence at least six feet high, supplemented by vegetative screening, may be substituted. Plans for the design and construction of such a wall or fence must be constructed along the designated property lines and maintained in good condition. (Amended 7/22/14; Ord. 2014-7)
The Planning Commission may require more restrictive buffers for any development that is expected to generate excessive noise, light, odor, or other nuisance.

This sign ordinance is adopted under the zoning authority of the City in furtherance of the more general purposes set forth in The Zoning Ordinance.
6.712. Applicability - Effect
This ordinance shall be called "Sign Regulations". These sections supplement other sections of the Zoning Ordinance and supersede any conflicting sections.
A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created, or maintained in the city only in conformance with the requirements of this ordinance.
The effect of this ordinance is:
- To establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in commercial and industrial zones, and a limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards and the permit procedures of this ordinance;
- To allow small, unobtrusive signs incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this ordinance.
- To prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this ordinance; and
- To provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance.
- To encourage the use of monument signs.
6.713. Effect - Construction
These sections shall be liberally construed to effect the purpose of reducing the number and size of signs, and to effect the purpose of advancing the statement of purpose of section 6.711.
These sections may not be construed or applied in such a way that would give a preference or greater degree of protection to a sign conveying a commercial message than is given to a sign similarly situated and constructed conveying a non-commercial message. These sections must be construed to apply to all signs irrespective of the commercial or non-commercial character of the content. Any ambiguity or question shall be resolved by allowing a non-commercial sign the same benefits, and other preferences that may be given to a commercial sign similarly constructed and situated, or by imposing on such commercial sign the same restriction imposed on the non-commercial sign similarly constructed and situated.
These sections apply to existing signs and to proposed signs. Proposed signs for which construction has not lawfully begun but for which an application has been made or for which a permit has been issued, must conform to these sections. This ordinance is to be construed as a comprehensive regulation in that all types of signs and supporting structures are allowed only in accordance with this ordinance. The message content of a sign is of almost no relevance in that a person desiring to display, for example, a message which is ordinarily considered an off-premise message and is ordinarily considered a non-commercial (i.e. ideological, political, religious, etc.) message, may display that message on a sign which is permitted as an on-premise commercial sign. Similarly, for example, an on-premise non-commercial message can be displayed on a sign which is permitted as an off-premise commercial sign.
Under the sign ordinances of this jurisdiction all signs are regulated, irrespective of whether the existing or future messages are of a commercial or non-commercial nature. The applicant for a sign may make the choice of category. As to existing signs the city shall decide the category, giving consideration to the overall practices and arrangements among the owners of the sign, the owner of the sign site, and the owner of the message. See, for example, the definitional criteria for off-premise signs and for commercial use in Section
70
6.72. Once the category is chosen the applicable ordinance will be applied. Therefore, changing the nature of the message on signs from, for example, a commercial message to a non-commercial type of message does not remove the sign from the previously designated category, and all regulations that applied to that category of sign will continue to apply after the nature of the message is changed.
If a sign is to change category from a previous category, a permit must be obtained and the sign must comply with the regulations for the new category. In construing this ordinance no provision is to be read as impliedly creating a type of sign that is not regulated or not prohibited.

6.763. Permits for Nonconforming Signs
A sign that could be permitted under this ordinance only with a sign permit, but which was in existence on the effective date of this ordinance, or on a later date when the property is annexed to the city, and which was constructed in accordance with the ordinances and other applicable laws in effect on the date of its construction, but which by reason of its size, height, location, design, or construction is not in conformance with the requirements of this ordinance, shall be issued a Nonconforming Sign Permit if an application in accordance with Section 6.762 of this ordinance is timely filed. Such permit shall allow the sign(s) subject to such permit, which were made nonconforming by the adoption of this ordinance, to remain in place and be maintained subject to the provisions of Section 6.75. A Nonconforming Sign Permit shall lapse and become void under the same circumstances as those under which any other sign permit may lapse and become void.
6.764. Violations
Any of the following shall be a violation of this ordinance and shall be subject to the enforcement remedies and penalties provided by this ordinance, by the zoning ordinance, and by state law:
(a) To install, create, erect, or maintain any sign in a way that is inconsistent with any plan or permit governing such sign or the zone lot on which the sign is located;
b) To install, create, erect, or maintain any sign requiring a permit without such a permit;
(c) To fail to remove any sign that is installed, created, erected, or maintained in violation of this ordinance, or for which the sign permit has lapsed; or

6.765. Enforcement and Remedies
Any violation of this ordinance or of any condition or requirement adopted pursuant hereto may be restrained, corrected, or abated, as the case may be, by injunction or other appropriate proceedings pursuant to state law. A violation of this ordinance shall be considered a violation of the zoning ordinance of the city. Remedies and enforcement options shall be applied to the person, persons, corporations, business or entity in whose name the sign permit issued and/or the owner of the property. The remedies of the city shall include the following:
(a) Issuing a stop-work order for any and all work on any signs on the same zone lot;
(b) Seeking an injunction or other order of restraint or abatement that requires the correction of the nonconformity or the removal of the sign(s);
(c) Imposing any penalties that can be imposed directly by the city under the zoning ordinance;
(d) Seeking in court the imposition of any penalties that can be imposed by such court under the zoning ordinance; and
85
(e) In the case of a sign that poses an immediate danger to the public health or safety, taking such measures as are available to the city under the applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance and building code for such circumstances.
The city shall have such other remedies as are and as may from time to time be provided for or allowed by state law for the violation of the zoning ordinance.
All such remedies provided herein shall be cumulative. To the extent that state law may limit the availability of a particular remedy set forth herein for a certain violation or a part thereof, such remedy shall remain available for other violations or other parts of the same violation.
Any sign installed or placed on public property, except in conformance with the requirements of this ordinance, shall be forfeited to the public and subject to confiscation. In addition to other remedies hereunder, the city shall have the right to recover from the owner or person placing such a sign the full costs or removal and disposal of such sign.
Section 6.77. Variances to Sign Requirements
The Zoning Board of Adjustments is hereby empowered to vary or adapt the strict application of the requirements of this ordinance. A variance may be appropriate where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape or by reason of other exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situation or conditions on a piece of property, the strict application of the following regulations enacted under this ordinance would result in peculiar, exceptional, and hardship on the owner of such property: sign setback, sign height, sign placement and/or sign type.
The following regulations enacted in this ordinance are not appealable: maximum allowable square footage of sign area, total number of signs allowed, maximum allowable total sign square footage allowed per site and regulations that protect public safety.
After denial of a sign permit by the Building Official, a property owner or sign contractor may apply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance. No variance in the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance shall be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless it finds that the strict application of the provisions would cause exceptional hardship to the property owner. In general, the power to authorize a variance from the terms of this ordinance shall be sparingly exercised and shall not apply to non-appealable regulations as set out in the second paragraph of this Section 6.77. It is the intent of this ordnance that the variance be used only to overcome some exceptional physical condition of a parcel of land which poses practical difficulty and prevents the owner from obtaining the full use and purpose of the sign as intended by this sign ordinance. Any variance granted shall be the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the sign.
The applicant must prove that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and that practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship will result if it is not granted. The Board may prescribe any safeguard that it deems necessary to secure substantially the objectives of the regulations or provisions to which the variance applies.
Section 6.78. Off-Site Sign Regulations
Off-site signs advertising a product for sale or a service to be rendered at a location other than the premises shall be permitted in the Forestry, Agricultural, and Residential District, and Commercial and Industrial Districts under the following conditions:
86
a. Where two (2) or more off-site signs are along the frontage of a single street or highway, they shall not be less than one thousand (1,000) feet apart. A double face (back to back) or v-type structure shall be considered a single sign.
b. The total surface area, facing in the same direction of any off-site sign, shall not exceed three hundred feet in area.
c. No off-site sign shall be erected on the roof of any buildings, nor shall one sign be placed above another sign.
d. Off-sit signs must be set back a minimum of 10 feet from the right-of-way and must not exceed a height of 35 feet.
Off-site signs may be illuminated by reflected light only, provided the source of light is not directly visible and is so arranged to illuminate away from the adjoining premises. No illumination involving movement by reason of lighting arrangement or other devices shall be permitted on off-site signs
Section 6.8. Large-Scale Retail
(1)Purpose and Intent
This purpose of this section is to provide standards that address the unique characteristics of large scale retail/commercial developments.
The intent of the standards is to achieve the following objectives:
1. To identify and mitigate impacts on traffic, city services, sensitive environments, land uses nearby, and community aesthetics and character.
2. To encourage large-scale, commercial-retail buildings and large-scale, commercial-retail development projects to have good architectural design rather than an enormous, warehouse appearance with unbroken, blank walls. Good design encourages clearly defined entryways, articulated rooflines to prevent monotony, pedestrian-amenity areas, and concealment of unsightly mechanical structures from public view.
3. To encourage pedestrian-oriented design that effectively resolves the incompatibility between pedestrians and motorists while providing interconnectivity between buildings, parking areas, and other internal/external components.
4. To encourage parking lot design that meets vehicular needs while providing a safer, efficient, comfortable pedestrian flow.
5. To encourage adequate landscaping that allows large buildings and their components to blend with their surroundings while providing screening and shade for the public benefit.
6. To encourage enhanced lighting and compatible signage design and to avoid forms of nuisance and intrusiveness into adjacent areas while enhancing public safety.
6.82. Applicability
The requirements of this section apply to all retail/commercial structures whose gross enclosed floor space equal or exceeds 65,000 sq. ft. Any project whose building permit has been applied
87
for or issued prior to the effective date of this amendment to the comprehensive zoning ordinance of the City Of Eufaula shall be allowed to proceed under the previous requirements.
6.83. Impact Studies
a. The applicant shall have a traffic impact study prepared consistent with the methodology commonly used by the Institute of Traffic Engineers. In addition to the general standards, the traffic impact study shall include weekend and holiday traffic generation and impact analysis. The traffic impact study shall also study intersections within a large enough area to take into account the regional traffic draw of a large-scale retail establishment. The traffic impact study shall be conducted by a certified traffic engineer registered in the State of Alabama.
b. The applicant shall provide detailed analysis of expected impacts on utilities and public services, including water, sewage, storm drains, solid waste disposal, police and fire protection, emergency services, and other public services.
6.84. Aesthetic and Visual Characteristics.
a. Facades and exterior walls including sides and backs. The building shall be designed in a way that will reduce the massive scale and uniform and impersonal appearance and will provide visual interest consistent with the communitys identity, character, and scale. Single-tenant structures shall provide variations in facade, roofline and depth to provide the appearance of multi-tenant occupancy. Long building walls of at least one hundred (100) feet shall be broken up with projections or recessions of sufficient depth along all sides, and in sufficient number, to reduce the unbroken massing into lengths of approximately fifty (50) feet or less along all sides of the building. Projections from the facade can be used as an alternate approach.
Along any public street frontage the building design should include windows, arcades, awnings or other acceptable features along at least sixty (60) per cent of the building length. Arcades and other weather protection features shall be of sufficient depth and height to provide a light-filled and open space along the building frontage. Architectural treatment, similar to that provided to the front facade shall be provided to the sides and rear of the building to mitigate any negative view from any location off-site and any public area (e.g. parking lots, walkways, etc.) on site.
b. Detail features. The building shall include architectural features that contribute to visual interest at the pedestrian scale and reduce the massive aesthetic effect by breaking up the building wall, front, side, or rear, with color, texture change, wall offsets, reveals, or projecting ribs.
c. Roofs. The roof design shall provide variations in rooflines and add interest to, and reduce the massive scale of, large buildings. Roof features shall complement the architectural and visual character of adjoining neighborhoods. Roofs shall include two (2) or more roof planes. Parapet walls shall be architecturally treated to avoid a plain, monotonous look.
d. Materials and color. The buildings shall have exterior building materials and colors that are aesthetically pleasing and compatible with materials and colors that are used in adjoining neighborhoods. This includes the use of high-quality materials and colors that are low reflective, subtle, neutral, or earth tone. Certain types of colors shall be avoided such as
88
fluorescent or metallic although brighter colors in limited quantities as building trims and as accents may be considered at the discretion of the Building Official.
Allowed building materials include:
1. Brick
2. Natural stone
3. Split-face block / concrete masonry (CMU)
4. Natural wood and/or cement based artificial siding
5. High grade stucco
6. Glass
Construction materials such as tilt-up concrete, smooth-faced concrete block, prefabricated steel panels, and other similar materials shall be avoided unless the exterior surface is covered with an acceptable architectural treatment.
e. Entryways. The building design shall provide design elements which clearly indicate to customers where the entrances are located and which add aesthetically pleasing character to buildings by providing highly-visible customer entrances.
f. Screening of mechanical equipment. Mechanical equipment shall be screened to mitigate noise and views in all directions. If roof-mounted, the screen shall be designed to conform architecturally to the design of the building either with varying roof planes or with parapet walls. A wood fence or similar treatment is not acceptable.
g. Architectural unity. All buildings on the same site shall architecturally unify. This applies to new construction, additions and remodeling. Architectural unity means that buildings shall be related in architectural style, color scheme, and building materials.
h. Signage. Sign construction materials, colors, and finishes shall be consistent with the associated buildings. No billboards are allowed on the site.
6.85. Site design and relationship to surrounding community
a. Vehicular access. The use shall provide safety and protection to adjacent residential uses by having motor vehicles access only from an arterial, major road or highway.
b. Utilities. All new utilities shall be placed underground.
c. Environmental Standards
1. The project shall not cause erosion, flooding, sedimentation, or increase the rate of runoff from the site. Provision shall be made for attenuation of runoff pollutants. The applicant shall supply pre and post development runoff calculations, performed by a certified civil engineer, with application for site plan review.
2. The project shall be designed to minimize the destruction of wetlands, unique natural features, wildlife habitat, and rare or endangered species. Special effort shall be made to maintain wetlands, wetland buffer zones and corridors between wetlands and wooded uplands.
d. Buffers. The use shall provide visual and noise buffers as necessary to protect nearby residential uses. No other uses, such as, but not limited to, parking or storage, are permitted
89
within the landscape buffer area except pedestrian amenities. The requirements of Section 6.63 shall apply.
e. Outdoor sales. Areas for outdoor sales of products may be permitted if they are extensions of the sales floor into which patrons are allowed free access. Such areas shall be incorporated into the overall design of the building and the landscaping and shall be permanently defined and screened with walls and/or fences. Materials, colors and design of screening walls and/or fences shall conform to those used as predominant materials and colors on the building. If such areas are to be covered, then the covering shall be similar in materials and colors to those that are predominantly used on the building façade.
No product such as fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides, cement, etc, containing toxic chemicals shall be stored in any uncovered outside location where they might enter the storm water drainage system in the event of any spillage, breakage or tearing of container. Outdoor storage sheds and containers shall be kept behind the principal building and shall be screened to eliminate visibility from adjacent property or public right of way.
f. Parking. Parking areas shall be distributed around large buildings in order to shorten the distance to other buildings and public sidewalks, and to reduce the scale of large paved surfaces. No more than sixty (60) percent of parking area shall be located in front of the principal building. Landscaping shall be used to define parking areas, primary vehicular drives and pedestrian areas. One (1) parking space shall be provided for every three hundred (300) sq. ft. of gross enclosed floor area. No single parking area shall exceed 120 spaces unless divided into two or more sub-areas by a building, internal landscaped street, or landscaped pedestrian way. Decorative, commercial-quality, bicycle racks, cart return areas, benches and trash receptacles shall be required and shall be approved by the Building Official. Landscaped islands shall be placed at the ends of long rows of parking spaces. For out parcels, no more than 20 percent of the parking shall be located between the building front and the adjacent right-of-way.
g. Pedestrian flows. The project shall provide pedestrian accessibility, safety, and convenience to reduce traffic impacts and enable the development to project a friendly inviting image. Sidewalks at least six (6) feet wide shall be provided along all sides of the lot that abut a public street. Continuous internal walkways, no less than five (5) feet in width shall be provided from the public sidewalk or right-of-way to the principal customer entrance of all principal buildings on the site. All internal walkways shall be distinguished from driving surfaces through the use of durable, low maintenance surface materials such as pavers, bricks or scored concrete to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort, as well as the attractiveness of the walkways. Internal walkways remote from the building shall be a minimum of five (5) feet wide and provide a minimum of six (6) feet of landscaped area parallel to the walkway. Said landscaped area shall contain shade trees a maximum of thirty (30) feet on center. Where parking spaces abut internal walkways wheel stops shall be provided to prevent vehicular encroachment over the walkway or landscaped area.
Landscaped strips and islands may be constructed at or below the grade of the parking surface so as to accept surface water runoff. Where walkways and landscaped areas are not raised and curbed, they shall be defined by wheel stops or other protective devices.
Walkways shall also connect the store to transit stops on or off-site and to nearby residential neighborhoods. Walkways shall be provided along the full length of any
90
building where it adjoins a parking lot. Internal pedestrian walkways shall provide weather protection features such as awnings or arcades within 30 feet of all customer entrances. Alternative design solutions for these pedestrian-circulation requirements that meet and exceed the intent and purpose of this section and this ordinance may be approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustment.
h. Central features and community spaces. The project is to provide attractive and inviting pedestrian scale features, spaces, and amenities. Entrances and parking lot locations shall be functional and inviting with walkways conveniently tied to logical destinations. Transit stops and/or customer drop-off/pick-up points shall be provided and integrated into the design and should not conflict with traffic lanes or pedestrian paths. Shelters with seating shall be provided at transit stops. Special design features such as towers, arcades, porticos, light fixtures, planter walls, seating areas, and other architectural features that define circulation paths and outdoor spaces shall anchor pedestrian ways. Examples are outdoor plazas, patios, courtyards, and window shopping areas. Each development should have at least two of these areas.
i. Delivery, loading, and trash collection, removal or compaction. Delivery, loading, and trash operations shall be designed and located to mitigate visual and noise impacts to adjoining residential neighborhoods. If there is a residential use or residentially zoned property adjacent to the site, such operations shall not be permitted between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. For good cause shown, the Planning Commission may permit deliveries at additional times provided the applicant submits evidence that sound barriers between all areas for such operations effectively reduce emissions to a level of forty-five (45) dB or less, as measured at the lot line of any adjoining property.
All delivery, loading, and trash collection, removal or compaction areas that are not within an enclosed building must be screened or recessed so that they are not visible from public streets, public sidewalks, internal pedestrian walkways, or adjacent residential properties.
j. Outdoor lighting. The applicant must provide an outdoor lighting plan which provides information on how outdoor lighting will be accomplished to minimize impacts on adjacent properties or roadways. This can be accomplished by aiming the lights down and placing hoods on them. The light element should not protrude below the lower edge of the hood. To minimize any indirect overflow of light on adjacent residential properties, the height of any proposed parking lot light standard should be as short as possible and should stair step down to a lower height when close to residential uses or residentially zoned properties.
k. Landscaping. Each parking area shall be surrounded by a ten-foot wide landscaped area around its edge. Shade trees are also required in the parking areas, with the amount and placement to be determined through consultation with the City Horticulturist at the time of site plan review. In addition, if a lot contains over one hundred (100) parking spaces, an area of not less than twenty (20) feet wide across any side of the site visible from the public right-of-way or adjacent property must be landscaped and screened with berms, hedges, and/or walls at least six (6) feet in height. All requirements of Section 6.61 shall apply.
l. Multi-tenant structures. Where principal buildings contain additional, separate stores which occupy less than 30,000 square feet of gross floor area, with separate, exterior customer entrances:
91
1. The street level façade of such stores shall be transparent between the height of 3 feet and 7 feet above the grade of the sidewalk for no less than 60% of the horizontal length of the building facade for each such store.
2. No window shall consist of reflective glass.
3. Along each façade with multiple exterior customer entrances, there shall be a sidewalk a minimum of eight (8) feet wide connecting all entryways. At least sixty (60) percent of said facade shall include a canopy, arcade, or other architectural and functional overhang that extends from the facade to a minimum of six (6) feet over the sidewalk.
6.86. Maintenance of Vacant Buildings
The following conditions shall also apply to Property Owners of any vacant structure where gross enclosed floor space equals or exceeds 65,000 square feet, regardless of when the building was erected:
a. The Property Owner will maintain the exterior of the building so as to keep the appearance similar to that when the building was fully occupied.
b. The Property Owner will maintain the landscaped areas in accordance with landscape plans approved by the City and in the same condition as such areas were maintained when the store was open to include, but not limited to adequate water and weeding.
c. The Property Owner will maintain the parking area in the same condition as such area was maintained when the store was open.
d. The Property Owner will maintain the cleanliness of the entire site by removing at least weekly any trash, rubbish, or other debris deposited or accumulated on the site.
6.87 Approval
Compliance with these regulations shall initially be determined by the Building Official or Horticulturist. In the event of a dispute between the Building Official or Horticulturist and the applicant as to what constitutes compliance, the applicant shall have the right to appeal to the Board of Zoning Adjustment.

However, in deciding whether or not any issued building permit should be revoked, the Board of Adjustment is directed to consider the reasons behind the improper issuing of the building permit. If the holder of said permit is found not to have materially contributed to the mistake and is found to substantially without fault, and provided further that the holder of the building permit has in good faith substantially prejudiced his position in reliance on said building permit, then said permit should not be revoked even though it was issued in violation of this ordinance, except in most extreme circumstances a danger, present or future, to the public welfare and safety.

building lines have been established; and second, when the building or structure has been completed and ready for occupancy.
7.242. It shall be the duty of the holder of the permit to properly notify the Building Inspector as to the time when the construction will be ready for inspection. Failure to make proper notification of the time for such inspection shall automatically cancel the permit, requiring the issuance of a new permit before construction may proceed or occupancy may be permitted.

ARTICLE TWELVE
SPECIAL REVIEW PROCEDURES
The purpose of this Article is to insure adequate review of specific developmental schemes that have direct influence on neighboring or contiguous land use districts. This review is so intended to protect the private and public values and interest in residential and business districts.
Section 12.1. Planned Unit Developments
The intent of this section is to provide an opportunity for the best use of land, protection of valuable natural features in the community, and economical public services. The purpose of this provision is to encourage the unified development of tracts of land by permitting, within the confines of an overall density limitation, more creative and flexible concepts in site planning than would be possible through the strict application of requirements established in this Zoning Ordinance. When such feasibility is permitted, Planned Development project design and construction shall follow a carefully devised plan of development which shall be prepared in accordance with the standards, procedures and approvals herein prescribed.
12.11. The following classes of planned unit developments are established:
12.111. A (Fixed Dwelling) Planned Unit Developments
A group of two (2) or more fixed dwelling structures, together with other permitted uses, on a parcel of ground not less than ten (10) acres in area in single ownership, with not less than three hundred (300) feet of frontage on a public street which frontage shall serve as the principal means of access to the property.
A PUDs will be allowed in all districts.
l2.112. B (Mobile Home) Planned Unit Residential Developments
Within the scope of the general purpose of Planned Developments, the purpose of this class is to recognize the increasing demand for the mobile home development type of residential area, and to provide for the appropriate development of such areas. It is intended to provide locational requirements and development standards which will lead to the development of stable and desirable mobile home developments, compatible with other uses in the vicinity.
Plans may be submitted for any parcel of land of five (5) acres or more in single ownership, zoned appropriately, for a mobile home planned unit development.
B PUDs will be allowed in MH, MHR, and FAR Districts.
B PUDs may be either mobile home parks with rental spaces and/or mobile homes, or mobile home subdivisions with ownership lots.
12.113. C Commercial Planned Unit Developments
Within the scope of the general intent of the Planned Developments, the purpose of this class is to recognize that tracts of land of considerable size can be developed, redeveloped, or renewed as integrated and harmonious units for commercial uses. The provisions of this ordinance may be applied to: any shopping center, retail structure or group of structures including those contained under one roof, having a total planned floor area of more than 13,000 square feet; any light industrial park or distribution warehouse of fifteen (15) acres; or heavy industrial park or distribution warehouse of twenty (20) acres.
