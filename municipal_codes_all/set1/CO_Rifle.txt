SUPPLEMENTATION 
The Rifle, Colorado Municipal Code, originally published by Colorado Code Publishing Company, will be kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
Supplements to this Code provide periodic updating through the removal and replacement of pages. This inter-leaf supplementation system requires that each page which is to be removed and replaced is identified so that the updating may be accurately accomplished and historically maintained. 
Instructions for supplementation are provided for each supplement, identified by Supplement number, date and inclusive ordinance numbers. The Instructions for posting the removal and replacement of pages must be followed and accomplished in sequence, with the most recent supplementation posted last. 
When supplementation is completed and the removal and replacement of all pages are accomplished, the Instructions should be placed behind the Supplementation tab, ahead of this page, with the most recent Instruction sheet on top. Previous Instructions should not be removed, so that the user may refer to this tab section to verify whether the code book is fully updated with all supplements included. 
The maintenance of a Municipal Code with all supplementation is an important activity which deserves close attention so that the value of the code is maintained as a fully comprehensive compilation of the legislative ordinances of the municipality.

CITY OF RIFLE HOME RULE CHARTER

RIFLE HOME RULE CHARTER 
TABLE OF CONTENTS 
PREFATORY SYNOPSIS 
PREAMBLE 
PREFATORY SYNOPSIS 
    The Rifle Charter Convention was elected on the 26th day of March, 1963, under the authority and the method set out by Article XX of the Constitution of the State of Colorado. The twenty-one elected members have been charged with the responsibility of drawing a document to prescribe the form and substance of Home Rule Government for the City of Rifle. 
    The delegates to the convention have viewed their task as one of great responsibility. 
    Two objectives have been uppermost in the minds of the members of the charter convention: 
    First: That the Charter must reserve to the people of Rifle the absolute right and power of self-government under the home rule provisions of the State Constitution. 
    Second: That the Charter must insure the orderly and economical management of the new government of Rifle, guided and controlled by the people through their elected representatives. 
    To these ends, the Charter provides for a Council-Manager form of government for our City and provides for the appointment of a City Manager, who will serve at the exclusive pleasure of the Council, with powers and duties as provided by the Charter and by the Council. 
    Under the Charter, the City Council will be responsible to the people, will be legislative in function, and enact ordinances for the good government of the City. The Council will consist of seven members, elected from the City at large in such a manner as to achieve overlapping terms, thus providing for continuity of city government. 
    All ordinances now in effect will remain in effect unless superseded by the provisions of the Charter, or hereafter amended and repealed by the City Council. 
    To insure the greatest possible control of governmental process by the people, provision is made in the Charter for the direct democratic techniques of initiative, referendum, and recall. These methods provide the means whereby the people can, if they wish, directly control the legislative process and recall any elected official who proves himself unsatisfactory. 
    Modern budget-making and fiscal procedures are included to insure that the city government will always operate as economically as possible and with the maximum degree of financial responsibility. The Manager will be the principal budget-making officer, subject to approval of the budget by the Council. 
    The Charter may be amended when need arises in accordance with provisions of the State Constitution. However, the convention believes the Charter is so written that it will serve the needs of Rifle for many years to come and will provide a sound, economical governmental structure. 
    The aims for the city government of Rifle and the scope of this Charter are not confined to the present, but are set out in this document to last for many generations, subject to the right of the people to make necessary changes to meet the possible unforeseen requirements of the future. 
    The Charter is designed to meet the continuing needs of a growing City and have a high quality of government. 
    This Charter guarantees and vests the final voice of city government in the people of Rifle. 
PREAMBLE 
    We, the people of Rifle, Colorado, under authority granted by the Constitution of Colorado, do ordain and establish this Charter for the City Government of Rifle.

5.2 - PETITION REQUIREMENTS 
    An initiation or referendum petition shall be signed by qualified electors in a number not less than ten percent of the number of persons who were registered electors of the City, as of the date of the last regular City election, and all signatures on said petition shall be obtained within twenty-one days before the date of filing the petition with the Clerk. Any such petition shall be addressed to the Council and may be the aggregate of two or more petition papers identical as to content and simultaneously filed by one person. An initiation petition shall set forth in full the ordinance it proposes to initiate, and no petition shall propose to initiate more than one ordinance. A referendum petition shall identify the ordinance or part thereof or code section it proposes to have repealed and shall be filed with the Clerk no later than the effective date specified in Section 4.4(h). Each signer of a petition shall sign his name, the date and his place of residence by street and number, or by other customary designation. To each petition paper, there shall be attached a sworn affidavit by the circulator thereof stating the number of signers thereof, and that each signature thereon is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be, and that it was made in the presence of the affiant. Such petition shall be filed with the Clerk who shall within fifteen days, canvass the signatures thereon. If the petition does not contain a sufficient number of signatures of qualified electors of the City, or any other error or insufficiency shall be found in the petition, the Clerk shall notify forthwith by registered mail the person filing such petition and fifteen days from such notification shall be allowed for filing of supplemental or corrected petition papers. When a petition with sufficient signatures is filed within the time allowed by this section, the Clerk shall present the petition to the Council at its next regular meeting. 
(Regular Municipal Election, September 1997; Ord 33-97 §3) 
5.3 - COUNCIL PROCEDURE ON INITIATION AND REFERENDUM PETITIONS 
    Upon presentation to the Council of an initiation or referendum petition by the Clerk, the Council shall, within thirty days, either: 
(a)  Adopt the ordinance as submitted by an initiation petition, 
(b)  Repeal the ordinance, or part thereof, referred to by a referendum petition, or 
(c)  Determine to submit the proposal provided for in the petition to the electors. 
5.4 - SUBMISSION OF INITIATION AND REFERENDUM ORDINANCES TO ELECTORS

RIFLE MUNICIPAL CODE 
2005 
A Codification of the General Ordinances 
of the City of Rifle, Colorado, 
A Home Rule Municipality 
Beginning with Supp. No. 9, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 

> 
PREFACE 
The City of Rifle, a Home Rule City, has published its Municipal Code in a format which features the following: 
The Table of Contents is the table containing each chapter and article title, with reference to page location. Preceding each chapter is a chapter table of contents, also identifying each article by the subject name provided. 
The three-place section numbering system places the chapter number first, followed by the article number and section number, separated by hyphens. Each section may be cited by the chapter, article and section number which are in sequence within each chapter. 
The open chapter and page numbering system creates reserved chapter and page numbers for expansion or revision of the code without undue complication when changes are made to the code by supplementation. 
The Disposition of Ordinances Table identifies the source for the contents of the code. This table provides ordinance numbers in chronological order and location by section number for the present code contents. Thus, if there is interest in determining whether an ordinance, or a portion thereof, is contained within the code, the Disposition of Ordinances Table will provide that information. The Table of Up-to-Date Pages lists all of the current pages through the most recent supplementation. 
The Index provides references by common and legal terminology to the appropriate code sections. Cross references are provided with the Index when appropriate. 
Supplements to the code provide regular updating of the code to maintain it as a current compilation of all the legislation which has general and continuing effect. Without regular supplementation, the code would soon lose its usefulness as a complete source of the general law of the municipality. Supplementation is accomplished by the periodic publication of additions and amendments to the code.

(a)  Any person who violates or fails to comply with any provision of this Code or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, for which a different penalty is not specifically provided, shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), by incarceration not to exceed one (1) year, or by both such fine and incarceration, except as hereinafter provided in Section 1-4-30. In addition, such person shall pay all costs and expenses in the case, including attorney fees. 
(b)  Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. 
(2)  Sec. 1-4-30. Application of penalties to juveniles. (General Provisions - General Penalty) 
(a)  For the purposes of this Section, a minor offender is defined as any person accused of an offense contrary to this Code who, on the date of the alleged offense, was at least ten (10) years of age, but not yet eighteen (18) years of age. 
(b)  Except as to alleged violations of the Model Traffic Code, as adopted by reference in Chapter 8 of this Code, any minor offender convicted of or pleads guilty or nolo contendere to a violation of this Code shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation or count, unless otherwise provided by the specific section alleged to have been violated. Any voluntary plea of guilty or nolo contendere to the original charge or to a lesser or substituted charge shall subject the person so pleading to all fines and/or penalties applicable to the original charge. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prohibit incarceration in an appropriate facility, at the time of charging, of a juvenile violating any section of this Code. Any minor offender convicted or found liable for violating any provision of the Model Traffic Code as adopted in Chapter 8 of this Code may be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), by incarceration not to exceed ninety (90) days, or by both such fine and incarceration. 
(c)  Nothing contained in this Code shall be construed to abrogate, abolish or otherwise limit the power of the Municipal Court to incarcerate a minor offender for contempt of court, whether by failure to obey a summons, subpoena or other lawful order of the court, including an order to pay a fine, or by personal conduct before the court. In addition, the Municipal Court may incarcerate a minor offender for violation of probation conditions imposed by the court. The Municipal Court shall have authority to order a minor offender confined in a juvenile detention facility operated or contracted by the Department of Institutions. If a juvenile facility is not available, or is not located within the County or within forty (40) miles of the County Jail, the minor offender may be confined in an adult facility so long as he or she is separated from adult offenders as required by Section 19-2-204(4), C.R.S. Any confinement of a child for contempt of Municipal Court or for violation of probation conditions shall not exceed forty-eight (48) hours. 
(d)  Upon the request of the Municipal Court, the prosecuting attorney or the defendant, the Municipal Court Clerk shall issue a subpoena for the appearance, at any and all stages of the court's proceedings, of the parent, guardian or lawful custodian of any child under eighteen (18) years of age who is charged with an offense under this Code.

All calculated surcharge amounts resulting in dollars and cents shall be rounded to the nearest whole dollar. In the event a portion of the fine is suspended, the surcharge shall be computed based on the amount of the fine as suspended. The defendant shall pay such surcharge to the Court Clerk at the time the fine is paid, whether the defendant appears in court or pays the fine through the mail. The Clerk shall deposit the money so received in the fund, and all such surcharges collected shall be used exclusively for training City police officers in the performance of their duties. 
. . . .

(b)  In cases of indirect contempt, the alleged contemnor shall have all the rights, privileges, safeguards and protections of a defendant in a petty offense case, including but not limited to a formal written complaint, arraignment and trial by jury. 
(5)  Sec. 4-2-240. Motor vehicles and trailers. (Revenue & Finance - Retail Sales & Use Tax)

This civil penalty shall be assessed as follows: 
(1)  When the Finance Director determines on such information as is available that a person has caused a motor vehicle to be registered in violation of the provision of Section 42-6-137(2), C.R.S., the Finance Director shall provide such person with a penalty assessment. If the City Treasurer has also determined pursuant to this Article that sales or use taxes are due to the City on the purchase of such motor vehicle, the penalty assessment may be included in the notice of deficiency. 
(2)  Such person shall pay the penalty assessment within the same time period provided pursuant to this Article for any amount due upon a notice of deficiency, unless the person files a protest in the manner provided in the following Paragraph. 
(3)  If the taxpayer desires to protest a penalty assessment, such person shall file a written protest with the Finance Director within the same time period prescribed for protesting a notice of deficiency. The protest shall set forth the facts which show that a violation of Section 42-6-137(2), C.R.S., did not occur. The Finance Director shall issue a written decision affirming or withdrawing the penalty assessment within the same time period and in the same manner as a protest of notice of deficiency. If the decision affirms the civil penalty assessment, the person shall pay the penalty assessment within the same period as provided in this Article for payment of any amount due pursuant to a notice of deficiency. 
(4)  The person may seek judicial review of the City Treasurer's decision pursuant to Rule 106, C.R.C.P. Judicial review shall be unavailable if the person failed to file a timely protest. 
(5)  The Finance Director may enforce collection of unpaid penalty assessment notices in the same manner as for collection of unpaid taxes, penalties or interest.

(6)  Sec. 4-2-350. Tax overpayments and deficiencies. (Revenue & Finance - Retail Sales & Use Tax) 
(a)  An application for refund of tax moneys paid in error or by mistake shall be made within three (3) years after the date of purchase, storage, use or consumption of the goods for which the refund is claimed. If the Finance Director determines within three (3) years of the due date that a vendor overpaid sales tax, he or she shall process a refund or allow a credit against a future remittance from the same taxpayer. If the amount paid is less than the amount due, the difference, together with interest, shall be paid by the vendor within ten (10) days after receiving written notice and demand from the Finance Director. The Finance Director may extend that time for good cause. 
(b)  If any part of the deficiency is due to negligence or intentional disregard of regulations but without intent to defraud, there shall be added ten percent (10%) of the total amount of the deficiency, together with interest, from the person required to file the return. If any part of the deficiency is due to fraud with the intent to evade the tax, there shall be added fifty percent (50%) of the total amount of the deficiency; and, in such case, the whole amount of the tax unpaid, including the additions, shall become due and payable ten (10) days after written notice and demand by the City Treasurer. 
(c)  Interest on underpayment, nonpayment or extensions of time for payment of tax. If any amount of sales or use tax is not paid on time, interest shall be paid for the period from the due date to the date paid. Interest shall be paid upon notice and demand and shall be assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as the tax to which it is applicable. 
(d)  When interest is required or permitted to be charged under any provision of this Article, the annual rate of interest shall be that established by the Colorado State Commissioner of Banking pursuant to Section 39-21-110.5, C.R.S.

(3)  A licensee or employee who fails or refuses to renew his or her license within the period granted herein may be assessed a civil penalty of up to fifty dollars ($50.00) for each day beyond said period that said refusal or failure continues, but not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00) for each refusal or failure. 
(4)  A licensee and any agent, officer, servant or employee of a licensee who maintains a nuisance on the licensed premises or permits the licensed premises to be unsanitary or unsafe may be assessed a civil penalty of up to one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each day that the nuisance or unsafe or unsanitary condition continues.

(8)  Any person who aids or participates in a violation for which a civil penalty may be assessed under this Article shall be considered a principal in the violation and may be assessed a civil penalty of up to the maximum amount prescribed for that violation.

Such other lawful actions shall include but shall not be limited to an equitable action for injunctive relief or an action at law for damages.

Statements shall include any additional charges, tolls, fees and assessments related to refuse collection service, such as late payment penalties, duplicate bill fees and other charges.

Sec. 2-4-180. - Notice to defendant. 
(a)  Upon obtaining jurisdiction over a defendant, all written notices by the Municipal Court to the defendant shall be deemed to be effective if mailed to the last know address of the defendant, as shown in the Municipal Court's records. 
(b)  The address shown on the summons and complaint contained in the Municipal Court's records shall be considered the last known address of the defendant, unless the defendant provides the Municipal Court with a different address. (Prior code 2.12.175) 
Sec. 2-4-190. - Penalty assessment procedure. 
(a)  When a person is charged with an offense pursuant to this Code, the charging officer may either give the person a penalty assessment notice and release him or her upon its terms or take him or her before the Municipal Judge if a penalty assessment has been established for said offense pursuant to Court order or by ordinance. The choice of procedures shall be based upon the circumstances which reasonably persuade the officer that the alleged offender is likely or unlikely to comply with the terms of the penalty assessment notice. Such circumstances may include the officer accompanying the offender to a post office or mail box and witnessing the deposit in the mail of the notice with payment of the penalty attached. 
(b)  The penalty assessment notice shall be a summons and complaint containing identification of the alleged offender, specification of the offense and applicable fine or penalty, a requirement that the alleged offender pay the fine or penalty or appear to answer the charge at a specified time and place, and any other matter reasonably adopted to effectuate the purposes of this Section. A duplicate copy shall be sent to the Court Clerk. The provisions of this Section shall not apply unless a penalty assessment for the alleged offense has been authorized by the Municipal Court or by ordinance. 
(c)  If the person given a penalty assessment notice chooses to acknowledge his or her guilt, he or she may pay the specified penalty in person or by mail at the place and within the time specified in the notice. If he or she chooses not to acknowledge his or her guilt, he or she shall appear as required in the notice. Upon trial, if the alleged offender is found guilty or liable, the penalty imposed shall be that specified in the notice for the offense of which he or she was found guilty or liable; and customary court costs may be assessed against him or her in addition to the fine or penalty. 
(d)  Penalty assessments may be authorized for both criminal and noncriminal offenses by ordinance or by order of the Municipal Court. (Prior code 2.12.200) 
Sec. 2-4-200. - Suspensions, deferred judgments and prosecutions, and stays of execution. 
(a)  When the Municipal Court determines that the ends of justice will be served thereby, the Municipal Court shall have the power to suspend the imposition of any fine or incarceration, and shall have the power to stay execution of the sentence for such period, not to exceed twelve (12) months, upon such terms and conditions as deemed appropriate by the Municipal Court. 
(b)  In any case in which the defendant has entered a plea of guilty or no contest, the Municipal Court has the power, with the written consent of the defendant, his or her attorney of record and the prosecuting attorney, to continue the case for a period not to exceed one (1) year from the date of entry of such plea for the purpose of entering judgment and sentence upon such plea of guilty. During such time, the Municipal Court may place the defendant under the supervision of any appropriate human services agency or mental health professional. 
(c)  Prior to the entry of a plea of guilty to be followed by deferred judgment and sentence, the prosecuting attorney, in the course of plea discussions, is authorized to enter into a written stipulation, to be signed by the defendant, his or her attorney of record and the prosecuting attorney, under which the defendant obligates himself or herself to adhere to such stipulation. The conditions imposed in the stipulation shall be similar in all respects to conditions permitted as part of probation. Said stipulation shall only be effective upon consideration and approval by the Municipal Court. Upon full compliance with such conditions by the defendant, the plea of guilty previously entered shall be withdrawn and the action against the defendant dismissed with prejudice. Such stipulation shall specifically provide that, upon a breach by the defendant of any conditions regulating the conduct of the defendant, the Municipal Court shall enter judgment and impose sentence upon such guilty plea. 
(d)  When, as a condition of the deferred judgment, the Municipal Court orders the defendant to pay restitution, compensation to appointed counsel, fines, fees or costs, evidence of the failure to pay shall constitute prima facie evidence of a violation. Whether a breach of condition has occurred shall be determined by the Municipal Court without a jury upon application of the prosecuting attorney and upon notice of hearing thereon of not less than five (5) days to the defendant or his or her attorney of record. Application for entry of judgment and imposition of sentence may be made by the prosecuting attorney at any time within the term of the deferred judgment or within forty-five (45) days thereafter. The burden of proof at such hearing shall be by preponderance of the evidence, and the procedural safeguards required in a revocation of probation hearing shall apply. When a defendant signs a stipulation providing that judgment and sentence shall be deferred for a specific time, certain, he or she thereby waives all rights to a speedy trial. 
(e)  In any case, the Municipal Court may, prior to trial or entry of a plea of guilty and with the consent of the defendant and the prosecuting attorney, order the prosecution of the offense to be deferred for a period not to exceed one (1) year. During that time, the Municipal Court may place the defendant under the supervision of any appropriate human services agency or mental health professional and may require the defendant to undergo counseling or treatment for his or her mental condition, for alcohol or drug abuse or for both conditions. 
(f)  Upon defendant's satisfactory completion of and discharge from supervision, the charge against the defendant shall be dismissed with prejudice. If the conditions of supervision are violated, the defendant shall be tried for the offense for which he or she is charged. The violation of conditions of supervision shall be determined by a hearing before the Municipal Court. The burden in such hearing shall be upon the prosecuting attorney by a preponderance of the evidence to show that a violation has in fact occurred. However, if the alleged violation is a failure to pay court-ordered compensation to appointed counsel, probation fees, court costs, restitution or reparations, evidence of the failure to pay shall constitute prima facie evidence of a violation. The Municipal Judge at the hearing may temper the rules of evidence in the exercise of sound judicial discretion. 
(g)  Upon consenting to a deferred prosecution as provided in this Section, the defendant shall execute a written waiver of his or her right to a speedy trial. Consent to a deferred prosecution under this Section shall not be construed as an admission of guilt, nor shall such consent be admitted in evidence in trial for the offense for which he or she is charged. (Prior code 2.12.210; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 2-4-210. - Probation. 
(a)  When it appears to the satisfaction of the Municipal Court that the ends of justice and the best interests of the public, as well as the defendant, will be served thereby, the Municipal Court may grant the defendant probation for such period not to exceed twelve (12) months, and upon such terms and conditions as it deems best. In addition to imposing other conditions, the Municipal Court has the power to require the defendant to pay any fines and costs in one (1) or more installments, and require the defendant to serve a period of imprisonment not to exceed thirty (30) days. 
(b)  Conditions of probation shall be such as the Municipal Court, in its discretion, deems necessary to ensure that the defendant will lead a law-abiding life and to assist him or her to do so. The Municipal Court shall provide as explicit conditions of every sentence to probation that the defendant not commit another offense, except minor traffic offenses, during the period for which the probation remains subject to revocation, and that the defendant make restitution, if applicable. 
(c)  When granting probation, the Municipal Court may, as a condition of probation, require that the defendant: 
(1)  Work faithfully at a suitable employment or faithfully pursue a course of study or vocational training that will equip him or her for suitable employment. 
(2)  Undergo available medical, psychological or mental health treatment and counseling, and remain in a specified institution if required for that purpose. The Municipal Court may require the defendant to undergo an evaluation by a mental health professional or similar professional person and may require the defendant to comply with the recommendation of said mental health professional or other professional person. 
(3)  Undergo counseling or treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, or for both such conditions. 
(4)  Attend or reside in a facility established for the instruction, recreation or residence of persons on probation. 
(5)  Support his or her dependents and meet other family obligations. 
(6)  Make restitution to the victim of his or her conduct or to a member of the victim's immediate family for the actual damages which were sustained. The amount of such restitution shall be based on the actual, pecuniary damages sustained by the victim; the ability of the defendant to pay; and the defendant's obligation to support his or her dependents and to meet other family obligations. The Municipal Court shall fix the manner and time of performance. 
(7)  Pay reasonable costs of the court proceedings, costs related to probation or both. When the payment of costs of court or probation is a condition of probation, the Municipal Court shall fix the amounts thereof, which shall not exceed an amount which the defendant can or will be able to pay, and shall fix the manner of performance. 
(8)  Pay any fines or fees imposed by the Municipal Court. 
(9)  Refrain from possessing a firearm, destructive device or other dangerous weapon unless granted written permission by the Municipal Court. 
(10)  Refrain from the use of alcohol or any unlawful use of controlled substances or any other dangerous or abusable drug without a prescription. 
(11)  Report to a human services agency, mental health professional or other similar professional person at reasonable times as directed by the Municipal Court. 
(12)  Remain within the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court, unless granted permission to leave by the Court. 
(13)  Answer all reasonable inquiries by the Municipal Court and promptly notify the Court of any change in address or employment. 
(14)  Satisfy any other conditions reasonably related to his or her rehabilitation and the purposes of prohibition. 
(d)  The order of priority for any payments required of the defendant pursuant to a grant of probation shall be as follows: restitution or reparation; support of defendant and meeting other family responsibilities; costs of court proceedings or costs related to probation; and any fines or other fees imposed by the Municipal Court. 
(e)  When a defendant is granted probation, he or she shall be given a written statement explicitly setting forth the conditions on which he or she is being released. 
(f)  For good cause shown and after notice to the defendant, the prosecuting attorney and, after a hearing if the defendant requests it, the Municipal Judge may reduce or increase the term of probation, alter the conditions or impose new conditions. (Prior code 2.12.220; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 2-4-220. - Revocation of probation. 
(a)  If a police officer or prosecuting attorney has reason to believe that the conditions of probation have been violated by a probationer, he or she may cause a summons to be issued requiring the probationer to appear before the Municipal Court at a specified time and place to answer charges of the violation of the conditions of probation. The summons, unless accompanied by a copy of the complaint, shall contain a brief statement of the violation and the date and place thereof. Failure of the probationer to appear before the Municipal Court as required by the summons shall be deemed a violation of the conditions of probation. A complaint filed by a police officer or prosecuting attorney shall contain the name of the probationer, shall identify the violation charged and the condition of probation alleged to have been violated, including the date and approximate location thereof, and shall be signed by the police officer or prosecuting attorney. A copy thereof shall be given to the probationer a reasonable length of time before he or she appears before the Municipal Court. A summons and/or complaint alleging a violation of probation may be issued any time during the period of probation or within forty-five (45) days thereafter; provided, however, that the Municipal Court may, for good cause shown, extend the period for filing the summons and complaint. 
(b)  A warrant for the arrest of any probationer for violation of the conditions of probation may be issued by the Municipal Court upon the verified complaint of any person establishing, to the satisfaction of the Municipal Court, probable cause to believe that a condition of probation has been violated and that the arrest of the probationer is reasonably necessary. The warrant may be executed by any peace officer authorized to execute warrants in the county in which the probationer is found. 
(c)  At the first appearance of the probationer in Municipal Court or at the commencement of the hearing, whichever is first in time, the Court shall advise the probationer of the nature of the proceeding and his or her rights; except that there shall be no right to a trial by jury in proceedings for revocation of probation. The Municipal Court shall advise the probationer of the charges against him or her and any penalties therefor, and shall require the probationer to plead guilty or not guilty. 
(d)  At the hearing, the prosecution has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the violation of a condition of probation; except that the commission of a criminal offense must be established beyond a reasonable doubt unless the probationer has been convicted thereof in a criminal proceeding. When, during a revocation hearing, the alleged violation of a condition is the probationer's failure to pay court-ordered compensation to appointed counsel, probation fees, court costs, restitution or reparations, evidence of the failure to pay shall constitute prima facie evidence of a violation. The Municipal Court may, when it appears that the alleged violation of conditions of probation consists of an offense with which the probationer is charged in a criminal proceeding then pending, continue the probation revocation hearing until the termination of the criminal proceeding. Any evidence having probative value shall be received regardless of its admissibility under the exclusionary rules of evidence if the defendant is accorded a fair opportunity to rebut any such evidence, whether hearsay or otherwise. 
(e)  If the Municipal Court determines that a violation of a condition of probation has been committed and the term of probation has not expired, it shall, within five (5) days after the hearing, either revoke or continue the probation. If probation is revoked or has expired, the Municipal Court may impose any sentence or grant any probation which may originally have been imposed or granted. (Prior code 2.12.230) 
Sec. 2-4-230. - Restitution. 
(a)  In any case where the victim has suffered pecuniary loss and the defendant pleads guilty or no contest, or is found guilty, the Municipal Court may, at its discretion, require a restitution hearing and, when found to be appropriate at such hearing, the Municipal Court shall order restitution in an amount determined at the restitution hearing as a condition of any sentence imposed. The restitution hearing, if required, shall be set by the Municipal Court at the time the defendant is found guilty or enters a plea of guilty or no contest, or when the defendant's plea bargain is accepted by the Municipal Court. 
(b)  For purposes of this Section, a victim shall be the party immediately and directly aggrieved by a defendant who is convicted of a criminal act. 
(c)  For purposes of this Section, the amount of restitution shall be based on the actual, pecuniary damages sustained by the victim, the ability of the defendant to pay and the defendant's obligations to support such defendant's dependents and to meet other family obligations. 
(d)  For purposes of this Section, compensable losses for which restitution may be ordered include but are not limited to the following: 
(1)  Reasonable medical and hospital expenses and expenses incurred for dentures, eyeglasses, hearing aids or other prosthetic or medically necessary devices. 
(2)  Loss of earnings. 
(3)  Outpatient care. 
(4)  Property damage. 
(5)  Mental health consulting. 
(6)  Payment of the deductible amount on an insurance policy. 
(e)  At the restitution hearing, the Municipal Court may consider any competent evidence establishing the monetary loss sustained by the victim. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to any restitution hearing. The standard of proof at such hearings shall be a preponderance of the evidence. The issue to be decided by the Municipal Court is the amount of reasonable restitution that should be paid by the defendant. Once the amount of restitution is established, the Municipal Court shall order such restitution be paid by the defendant to the victim as part of any sentence imposed by the Municipal Court. (Ord. 22 §2, 2005) 
Sec. 2-4-240. - Fees and costs.

(2)  If any private person complainant, in an action before the Municipal Court, requests dismissal of the prosecution of said action, willfully absents himself or herself from trial or fails to appear at trial, and said action is dismissed, the Court shall give judgment against said private person complainant for all applicable fees and costs.

The defendant shall pay such surcharge to the Court Clerk at the time the fine is paid, whether the defendant appears in Court or pays the fine through the mail. The Clerk shall deposit the money so received in the fund, and all such surcharges collected shall be used exclusively for training City police officers in the performance of their duties. 
(d)  Jury fee. At the time he or she demands a jury trial, the defendant shall pay a jury fee as set forth in Appendix A to this Code to the Court Clerk. If the defendant is subsequently found not guilty, or the charges against him or her are dismissed, the jury fee shall be returned.

Mileage fees shall be paid by the City. This Subsection shall not apply to an officer of the court who attends in his or her official capacity, including clerks, sheriffs, bailiffs and police officers. 
(g)  Deferred judgment or deferred prosecution fee. In all actions in which a defendant is granted a deferred judgment and sentence or a deferred prosecution, the defendant shall be assessed a fee in the amount set forth in Appendix A to this Code to defray the costs of preparing applicable court documents and of monitoring compliance with the terms of the deferred judgment and sentence. Nothing contained in this Article shall prevent the Court from assessing additional fees in the event the defendant is required to undergo counseling, treatment or supervision by a human services agency, mental health professional or similar professional.

(i)  Bench warrant fee. In all actions in which a bench warrant is issued for the arrest of a defendant for failure to appear or failure to pay fines and costs as ordered by the Municipal Court, the Municipal Court shall assess against said defendant a fee in the amount set forth in Appendix A to this Code in addition to all other fees and costs due and owing.

In the event a portion of the fine is suspended, the surcharge shall be computed based on the amount of the fine as suspended. The defendant shall pay such surcharge to the Court Clerk at the time the fine is paid, whether the defendant appears in court or pays the fine through the mail. The Court Clerk shall deposit the money so received in a separate fund, and all such surcharges collected shall be used exclusively for YouthZone in the performance of its duties in the City. 
(l)  Certification fee. The Court Clerk shall charge a five-dollar fee per certification of any document.

The estimated amount of use tax assessed shall be calculated multiplying the fifty percent (50%) figure by the current use tax percentage rate; provided, however, that nothing herein shall modify Section 4-2-210 pertaining to use taxes on manufactured homes and mobile homes. 
(g)  Any person or entity paying the use tax who disagrees with the amount of the estimated tax as calculated herein shall have the right, upon completion of the project, to dispute the use tax assessment through presenting a final itemized cost breakdown, with invoices of purchases of construction and building materials, to the Finance Director, and must prove that the assessed tax and amount deposited with the Finance Director at building permit issuance is inconsistent with the amount of use tax deposited with the City. The decision of the Finance Director shall be final and appealable to a court of competent jurisdiction. Any dispute and request for the Finance Director to review a final itemized cost breakdown and invoices must be made within thirty (30) days of final inspection, or the amount assessed and deposited upon the issuance of the building permit shall be conclusively determined to be the use tax due, and the deposit shall be retained by the City; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prohibit the City from performing an audit pursuant to this Article to determine if the amount of use tax deposited with the City upon the issuance of the building permit is consistent with the amount of actual use tax due to the City. 
(h)  Fraudulent misuse of the use tax certificate shall be a crime punishable in accordance with Section 4-2-470(c) of this Article.

The Finance Director shall issue a written decision affirming or withdrawing the penalty assessment within the same time period and in the same manner as a protest of notice of deficiency. If the decision affirms the civil penalty assessment, the person shall pay the penalty assessment within the same period as provided in this Article for payment of any amount due pursuant to a notice of deficiency. 
(4)  The person may seek judicial review of the City Treasurer's decision pursuant to Rule 106, C.R.C.P. Judicial review shall be unavailable if the person failed to file a timely protest.

Editor's note- Ord. 12 §2, adopted May 18, 2016, shall be effective June 1, 2016. 
Sec. 4-2-360. - Taxpayers' remedies. 
(a)  Any notice of assessment may be protested by the taxpayer to whom it is issued. When the City asserts that sales or use taxes are due in an amount greater than the amount paid by a taxpayer, the City shall mail a deficiency notice to the taxpayer by certified mail. The deficiency notice shall state the additional sales and use taxes due. The deficiency notice shall contain notification, in clear and conspicuous type, that the taxpayer has the right to elect a state hearing on the City's denial of such taxpayer's claim for a refund of sales or use tax paid. As used in this Section, state hearing means a hearing before the Executive Director of the Department of Revenue or delegate thereof as provided in Section 29-2-106.1(3), C.R.S. 
(1)  Protests must be submitted in writing to the Finance Director on or before the payment date of such notice of assessment and must identify the amount of tax disputed and the basis for the contention that the tax is not due. 
(2)  When a timely protest is made, no further enforcement action will be instituted by the City and no further interest will accrue for the portion of the assessment being protested unless the taxpayer fails to pursue the protest in a timely manner. 
(b)  Any denial of a claim for refund may be protested by the taxpayer who submitted the claim. Such protest must be submitted in writing to the Finance Director within thirty (30) days of the Finance Director's denial and shall identify the amount of the denial contested and the basis for the contention that the refund is due. 
(c)  Any timely protest entitles a taxpayer to a hearing under the provisions of this Article. 
(1)  If, in the opinion of the Finance Director, the issues involved in such protest are not a matter of interpretation or may be resolved administratively, the Finance Director may recommend an informal meeting with the taxpayer. 
(2)  Participation in such an informal meeting does not prevent either the taxpayer or the City from holding a hearing if the dispute cannot be resolved by such meeting. 
(3)  The City shall commence a hearing within ninety (90) days after the City's receipt of the taxpayer's written protest; except that the City may extend such period if the delay is requested by the taxpayer. The Finance Director shall notify the taxpayer in writing of the time and place of such hearing which, in any case, must be held within one hundred eight (180) days of the taxpayer's written request. 
(4)  Every hearing shall be held before the Finance Director. 
(5)  The taxpayer may assert any facts, make any arguments and file any briefs and affidavits which, in the opinion of the taxpayer, are pertinent to the protest. The filing of briefs shall not be required. 
(6)  Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the Finance Director shall issue a findings of fact, conclusions and decision, which may modify or abate in full the tax, penalties and interest protested at the hearing, approve a refund or uphold the assessment. 
(7)  After such hearing, the taxpayer shall not be entitled to a second hearing on the same notice of assessment or denial of refund. 
(8)  Unless the decision of the Finance Director is appealed as provided in this Article, the remaining tax due, if any, shall be paid on or before thirty (30) days after the date of the findings of fact, conclusions and decision. 
(d)  The taxpayer shall request a state hearing within thirty (30) days after the taxpayer's exhaustion of local remedies. The taxpayer shall have no right to such hearing if he or she has not exhausted local remedies or if he or she fails to request such hearing within the time period provided for in this Section. For purposes of this Subsection, exhaustion of local remedies means: the taxpayer has timely requested in writing a hearing before the City and the City held such hearing and issued a final decision thereon. 
(e)  If a taxpayer has exhausted his or her local remedies as provided above, the taxpayer may request a state hearing on such deficiency notice or claim for refund, and such request shall be made and such hearing conducted in the same manner as set forth in Subsections 9-2-106.1(3) through (7), C.R.S. 
(f)  If the deficiency notice or claim for refund involves only the City, in lieu of requesting a state hearing, the taxpayer may appeal such deficiency notice or denial of a claim for refund to the district court of the County as provided in Section 9-2-106.1(8), C.R.S., provided that the taxpayer complies with the procedures set forth. If the City reasonably finds that the collection of sales or use tax will be jeopardized by delay, the City may utilize the procedures set forth in Section 39-21-111, C.R.S. 
(Prior code 3.04.450)

(3)  Liens. No notice of lien shall be issued more than three (3) years after the due date of the tax due. If the limitation period is extended, a notice of lien may be filed on or before thirty (30) days from the date of the notice of assessment issued for such extended period.

a.  The taxpayer and the Finance Director may agree in writing to extend the period.

Audit period is the thirty-six-month reporting period preceding the date of the notice of audit or, if a City building permit is required, the period between the issuance of such building permit thirty (30) days following the performance of the final inspection by the City. 
(8)  Performance of an audit does not constitute a statute of limitations or preclude additional audits of the same period within the parameters of this Section. 
(Prior code 3.04.460; Ord. 15 §4, 2004; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 4-2-380. - Coordinated audit procedure. 
(a)  Any taxpayer licensed in the City pursuant to this Code and holding a similar sales tax license in at least four (4) other Colorado municipalities that administer their own sales tax collection may request a coordinated audit as provided herein. 
(b)  Within fourteen (14) days of receipt of notice of an intended audit by any municipality that administers its own sales tax collection, the taxpayer may provide to the Finance Director, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a written request for a coordinated audit indicating the municipality from which the notice of intended audit was received and the name of the official who issued such notice. Such request shall include a list of those Colorado municipalities utilizing local collection of their sales tax in which the taxpayer holds a current sales tax license and a declaration that the taxpayer will sign a waiver of any passage-of-time based limitation upon the City's right to recover tax owed by the vendor for the audit period. 
(c)  Except as provided in Subsection (g) below, any taxpayer who submits a complete request for a coordinated audit and promptly signs a waiver of the time limitations provided by Section 4-2-370 above may be audited by the City during the twelve (12) months after such request is submitted only through a coordinated audit involving all municipalities electing to participate in such an audit. 
(d)  If the City desires to participate in the audit of a taxpayer who submits a complete request for a coordinated audit pursuant to Subsection (b) above, the Finance Director shall so notify the finance director of the municipality whose notice of audit prompted the taxpayer's request within ten (10) days after receipt of the taxpayer's request for a coordinated audit. The Finance Director shall then cooperate with other participating municipalities in the development of arrangements for the coordinated audit, including arrangement of the time during which the coordinated audit will be conducted, the period of time to be covered by the audit and a coordinated notice to the taxpayer of those records most likely to be required for completion of the coordinated audit. 
(e)  If the taxpayer's request for a coordinated audit was in response to a notice of audit issued by the City, the Finance Director shall facilitate arrangements between the City and other municipalities participating in the coordinated audit unless and until an official from another participating municipality agrees to assume this responsibility. The Finance Director shall cooperate with other participating municipalities to, whenever practicable, minimize the number of auditors that will be present on the taxpayer's premises to conduct the coordinated audit on behalf of the participating municipalities. Information obtained by or on behalf of those municipalities participating in the coordinated audit may be shared only among such participating municipalities. 
(f)  If the taxpayer's request for a coordinated audit was in response to a notice of audit issued by the City, the Finance Director shall, once arrangements for the coordinated audit between the City and other participating municipalities are completed, provide written notice to the taxpayer of which municipalities will be participating, the period to be audited and the records most likely to be required by participating municipalities for completion of the coordinated audit. The Finance Director shall also propose a schedule for the coordinated audit. 
(g)  The coordinated audit procedure set forth in this Section shall not apply: 
(1)  When the proposed audit is a jeopardy audit; 
(2)  To audits for which a notice of audit was given prior to the effective date of the initial ordinance codified in this Section; 
(3)  When a taxpayer refuses to promptly sign a waiver of the time limitations provided in Section 4-2-370 above; or 
(4)  When a taxpayer fails to provide a timely and complete request for a coordinated audit as provided in Subsection (b) above. 
(Prior code 3.04.470; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 4-2-390. - Inter-city claims for recovery. 
    The intent of this Section is to streamline and standardize procedures related to situations where tax has been remitted to the incorrect municipality. It is not intended to reduce or eliminate the responsibilities of the taxpayer or vendor to correctly pay, collect and remit sales and use taxes to the City. 
(1)  As used herein, claim for recovery means a claim for reimbursement of sales and use taxes paid to the wrong taxing jurisdiction. 
(2)  When it is determined by the Finance Director that sales and use tax owed to the City has been reported and paid to another municipality, the City shall promptly notify the vendor that taxes are being improperly collected and remitted and that, as of the date of the notice, the vendor must cease improper tax collections and remittances. 
(3)  The City may make a written claim for recovery directly to the municipality that received tax and/or penalty and interest owed to the City or, in the alternative, may institute procedures for collection of the tax from the taxpayer or vendor. The decision to make a claim for recovery lies in the sole discretion of the City. Any claim for recovery shall include a properly executed release of claim from the taxpayer and/or vendor releasing its claim to the taxes paid to the wrong municipality; evidence to substantiate the claim; and a request that the municipality approve or deny in whole or in part the claim within ninety (90) days of its receipt. The municipality to which the City submits a claim for recovery may, for good cause, request an extension of time to investigate the claim, and approval of such extension by the City shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(4)  Within ninety (90) days after receipt of a claim for recovery, the City shall verify to its satisfaction whether or not all or a portion of the tax claimed was improperly received, and shall notify the municipality submitting the claim in writing that the claim is either approved or denied in whole or in part, including the reasons for the decision. If the claim is approved in whole or in part, the City shall remit the undisputed amount to the municipality submitting the claim within thirty (30) days of approval. If a claim is submitted jointly by a municipality and a vendor or taxpayer, the check shall be made to the parties jointly. Denial of a claim for recovery may only be made for good cause. 
(5)  The City may deny a claim on the grounds that it has previously paid a claim for recovery arising out of an audit of the same taxpayer. 
(6)  The period subject to a claim for recovery shall be limited to the thirty-six-month period prior to the date the municipality that was wrongly paid the tax receives the claim for recovery. 
(Prior code 3.04.480; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 4-2-400. - Lien for tax due. 
(a)  If any tax due is not paid by the payment date of a notice of assessment, the Finance Director may issue a notice of lien on the real and personal property of the taxpayer. Such lien shall specify the name of the taxpayer, the tax due, the date of accrual thereof, and the location of the property, and shall be certified by the Finance Director. The City shall assess any additional charges as established in Appendix A to this Code for processing and preparation of any notice of lien provided to a retail taxpayer as set forth herein. Any such additional charges shall be included in and be a part of the lien. The Finance Director may, at any time before, after, or concurrently, have a summons and complaint issued consistent with Sections 1-4-20 and 4-2-470. 
(b)  The notice of lien shall be filed in the office of the Clerk and Recorder of any county in Colorado in which the real or personal property of the taxpayer is located. Such filing shall create a lien on such property in that county and constitute a notice thereof. 
(c)  The attachment and priority of such lien shall be as follows: 
(1)  Such lien shall be a first and prior lien upon the goods and business fixtures owned or used by any taxpayer, including those used under lease, installment sale or other contract agreement, and shall take precedence on all such property over all other liens or claims of whatsoever kind or nature. 
(2)  Such lien on the real and tangible personal property of the taxpayer that is not goods, stock in trade and business fixtures shall be a first and prior lien except as to preexisting claims or liens of a mortgagee, pledgee, judgment creditor or purchaser whose rights have attached and been perfected prior to the filing of the notice of lien. 
(3)  The personal property of an owner who has made a lease to a taxpayer shall be exempt from the lien created in this Subsection if such property can reasonably be identified from the lease description and if the lessee is given no right to become the owner of the property leased. This exemption shall be effective from the date of the execution of the lease if the lease is recorded with the County Clerk and Recorder of the county where the property is located or based. 
(4)  Automotive vehicles which are properly registered in the State, showing the lessor as owner thereof, shall be exempt from such lien except that such lien shall apply to the extent that the lessee has an earned reserve, allowance for depreciation not to exceed the fair market value or similar interest which is or may be credited to the lessee. 
(5)  Where a lessor and lessee are blood relatives or relatives by law or have twenty-five percent (25%) or more common ownership, a lease between such lessee and such lessor shall not be considered as for purposes of this Section. 
(d)  If a notice of lien is filed against real property, the Finance Director may direct the City Attorney to file a civil action to enforce such lien. The court may determine the interest in the property of each party, decree a sale of the real property and distribute the proceeds according to such findings. The procedure for the action and the manner of sale, the period for and manner of redemption from the sale, and the execution of the deed of conveyance shall be in accordance with the law and practices relating to foreclosures of mortgages upon real property. In any such action, the court may appoint a receiver of the real property involved in such action if equity so requires.

(b)  Enforcement of a jeopardy assessment and demand for payment may be stayed if the taxpayer gives security for payment which is satisfactory to the City Manager.

Sec. 4-3-40. - Methods and procedures for source selection. 
(a)  Sole source. Procurements may be made without competition when the Purchasing Agent reasonably determines, after conducting a good faith review of available sources, that there is only one (1) viable source within the relevant supply area for the required supply, service or construction item. The Purchasing Agent shall conduct negotiations, as appropriate, as to price, delivery and terms. A record of sole-source procurements shall be maintained for one (1) year from the date of purchase. 
(b)  Emergency procurements. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Article, the Purchasing Agent may make or authorize others to make emergency procurement of supplies, service or construction items in a maximum amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), when there exists a threat to public health, safety or welfare, and when the purchase cannot reasonably be delayed: 
(1)  Until one (1) of the following events occurs: 
a.  A special meeting of the City Council is convened; or 
b.  A quorum can be reached where a special meeting call has failed to achieve a quorum; and 
(2)  Until compliance with this Article can be accomplished. 
The Purchasing Agent shall attempt, where circumstances permit, to conduct a telephone poll of the Mayor and City Council prior to emergency purchases. The Purchasing Agent shall determine the procurement process for emergency purchases, provided that competition shall be encouraged to the extent practicable under the circumstances. The Purchasing Agent shall report all emergency purchases to the City Council at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
(c)  Open market. Open market purchases involve an informal evaluation of price, quality, convenience and service from any source, and the exercise of sound decision-making by the Purchasing Agent based on such information. 
(d)  Comparative pricing. For purchases based on comparative pricing, the Purchasing Agent shall solicit quotes from no less than three (3) vendors/suppliers, unless it is impracticable under the circumstances to obtain three (3) quotes. Quotes may be solicited by telephone, fax or in writing, in the discretion of the Purchasing Agent. 
(e)  Requests for proposals (RFPs). RFPs must be in writing, shall be distributed to a minimum of three (3) firms or individuals, and the Purchasing Agent shall reserve the right to reject any and all proposals. 
(f)  Competitive sealed bidding. Where competitive sealed bidding is required by Section 4-3-50 below, the following procedures shall apply: 
(1)  Notice to bidders. An invitation for bids will be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the City a minimum of two (2) times, at least ten (10) days prior to the date set for the opening of sealed bids. For bonded bids, notice shall also be published one (1) time in the appropriate publication, at least ten (10) days prior to the date for bid opening. The notice shall state: a general description of the materials and/or services to be procured; the place where bid blanks and specifications may be obtained; the closing date for acceptance of bids; the time and place for opening bids; the need for bonding, if applicable; and the reservation by the Purchasing Agent of the right to reject any and all bids. 
(2)  Bid requirements. Each bid submitted to the City shall meet the following conditions: 
a.  A signed, written bid, enclosed in a sealed envelope, and filed with the City by the deadline stated in the invitation for bids. 
b.  Only one (1) bid will be accepted per bidder. 
c.  Where bonded bids are required by Section 4-3-50 below, the bid shall be accompanied by a certified check or bid bond equal to five percent (5%) of the bid, to be forfeited to the City if a bid is accepted and the bidder fails to sign a contract within fifteen (15) days of acceptance. 
(3)  Pre-bid qualification. Competitive sealed bidding may be limited to prequalified bidders if the Purchasing Agent determines in his or her sole discretion, after conducting a good faith review of potential bidders, that it is in the best interests of the City to allow a limited number of persons to bid on a particular procurement, because special qualifications are needed. 
(4)  Withdrawal/correction of bids. Bids may be withdrawn up to twenty-four (24) hours prior to expiration of the deadline for submitting bids. An otherwise low bidder is permitted to correct a material mistake in his or her bid, including price, when the intended bid is obvious from the bid document or is otherwise supported by proof that has evidentiary value. A low bidder is not permitted to correct a bid for mistakes or errors in judgment. 
(5)  Waiver of informalities in bids. The Purchasing Agent may waive informalities in a bid if: 
a.  The item is only a matter of form or is an immaterial variation from the exact requirements of the invitation for bids; 
b.  The item being waived has trivial or no effect on price, quality, quantity, delivery or performance; and 
c.  Such a waiver would not affect the relative standing of bidders or otherwise prejudice other bidders. 
(6)  Bid opening procedure. At the time and place specified in the notice for bids, the Purchasing Agent shall open the sealed bids in public. The Purchasing Agent will announce the names of those who have bid and the amounts of the bids, and shall state whether any bids submitted have been withdrawn. As the bids are opened, such details as are appropriate shall be read and copied on the bid tally record, which will be open for public inspection. The person recording bids shall sign the tally sheet. 
(7)  Bid evaluation; award. The Purchasing Agent shall perform a review and analysis of all tabulated bids. Evaluation criteria include a combination of price, quantity and/or quality offered, and capacity to fulfill all requirements of the contract. For bonded competitive bids, unless all bids are rejected, the award shall be made to the lowest qualified bidder, as defined in Section 4-3-20 above. All awards shall be made by the awarding authority (City Council or the Purchasing Agent) by written notice to the bidder. Alternate bids may be awarded whenever it is deemed necessary by the Purchasing Agent. Other than for bonded competitive bids, the City need not award a bid to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder, but rather the bid shall be awarded to the bidder who, in the sole discretion of the awarding authority, provides the best overall value to the City based on the evaluation criteria described in this Paragraph. 
(8)  Rejection of bids. The Purchasing Agent may reject all or any part of a bid (unless the bid expressly excludes the ability to partially accept the bid) when it is determined to be in the best interests of the City, or if the vendor or contractor is in default on the payment of taxes, license fees or other sums due to the City. 
(9)  Nonresponsive vendor. Any vendor/ bidder who fails to comply with the terms of an awarded contract, quote or purchase order, or the required specifications contained in the bid, may be declared a nonresponsive vendor/bidder by the Purchasing Agent. Any nonresponsive vendor/bidder may be removed by the Purchasing Agent and/or the awarding authority from all vendor and bid lists compiled by the City for a period not to exceed three (3) years. 
(10)  Bonding; conditions. For a contract awarded based on a bonded competitive bid, the individual or company contracting with the City shall be required at the time the contract is executed to deliver to the City a contractor's performance bond or a labor and material payment bond in the amount of one hundred percent (100%) of the contract price, with a good and sufficient surety, for approval by the Purchasing Agent. Such contractor shall properly perform work required by the contract on behalf of the City, and shall promptly pay all amounts lawfully due to all persons supplying or furnishing labor or materials, used or performed in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract. Further, the contractor shall indemnify and hold the City harmless for all payments or liabilities arising from the execution of the terms of the contract.

(Ord. 18 §13, 2002) 
Sec. 5-1-545. - Service availability. 
(a)  New construction. Subject to the provisions of Subsection (b) below, the Grantee shall provide cable service within one hundred twenty (120) days of request for cable service in newly constructed areas, subject to weather conditions and permitting restrictions of the City. For purposes of this Section, a request shall be deemed made on the date of signing a service agreement, receipt of funds by the Grantee or receipt of a written request by the Grantee. The Grantee shall provide such service: 
(1)  With no line extension charge except as may apply under Subsection (b); and 
(2)  For a standard installation (which shall consist of a one-hundred-twenty-five-foot aerial cable drop) at a nondiscriminatory standard installation charge, with additional charges for a nonstandard installation, computed according to a nondiscriminatory methodology for such installation. 
(b)  Required extensions of service. The cable system, as constructed as of the effective date of this franchise, complies with the material provisions hereof. Whenever the Grantee shall receive a request for cable service from potential customers in a contiguous unserved area where there are at least fifty (50) residences within one (1) cable mile from the portion of the Grantee's trunk or distribution cable which is to be extended, the Grantee shall extend its cable system to such customers at no cost to said customers for the cable system extension, other than the installation or connection fees charged to all customers, provided that such extension is technically feasible. 
(c)  Customer charges for extensions of service. No customer shall be refused cable service arbitrarily. However, for unusual circumstances, such as a customer's request to locate the cable drop underground, the existence of more than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet of distance from distribution cable to connection of cable service to customers, or a density of less than fifty (50) residences within one (1) cable mile of the Grantee's trunk or distribution cable which is to be extended, cable service may be made available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of material, labor and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne by the Grantee and customers in the area in which cable service may be expanded, the Grantee will contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences per one (1) cable mile of its trunk or distribution cable and whose denominator equals fifty (50). Customers who request service hereunder will bear the remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro rata basis. The Grantee may require that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential customers be paid in advance. 
(Ord. 18 §14.1, 2002) 
Sec. 5-1-550. - Connection of facilities.

In addition, the Grantee shall provide, at no cost to the building owner, one (1) outlet of basic cable service to all future administrative buildings owned and occupied by the City, fire stations, police stations, schools and public libraries if such future buildings are passed by the cable system. The Grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to such future buildings where a nonstandard installation is required unless the Grantor or the building owner or occupant agrees to pay the incremental cost of the nonstandard installation. The cable service provided shall not be used for commercial purposes, nor shall such outlets be located in areas open to the public. Outlets of basic cable service provided in accordance with this Section may be used to distribute cable service throughout such buildings at the building owner's cost. The Grantee shall provide such free service outlet, provided that: (a) such distribution can be accomplished without causing cable system disruption; and (b) general technical standards can be maintained. The Grantor shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the Grantee's cable system that in any manner results in inappropriate use thereof, or any loss or damage to the cable system.

ARTICLE VI - Oil and Gas Exploration and Production 

Sec. 6-6-10. - Scope. 
    Unless otherwise stated in this Article, this Article shall apply to any and all exploration, development or production of oil and/or gas within the City limits, notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary as stated in Chapter 16 of this Code pertaining to zoning. The provisions of these regulations shall apply to the construction, alteration, repair, erection, location and maintenance of any gas and/or oil well or related structures within the City limits. 
(Prior code 5.24.010; Ord. 40 §2, 2006) 
Sec. 6-6-20. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this Article is to provide for exploration and development of oil and gas within the City, to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City, to provide for sound environmental and safety practices for oil and gas operations within the City, and to prevent damage to City streets and bridges. It is recognized that under state law the surface and mineral estates are separate and distinct interests in land and that one may be severed from the other. Owners of subsurface mineral interests have certain legal rights and privileges, including the right to use that portion of the surface estate reasonably necessary to extract and develop their subsurface mineral rights. The State has a recognized interest in fostering the efficient development, production and utilization of oil and gas resources, and particularly in the prevention of waste and protection of the correlative rights of mineral interest owners and producers to a fair and equitable share of production profits. Similarly, owners of the surface estate have certain legal rights and privileges, including the right to be accommodated by the mineral lessee, which includes the right to require the lessee to use reasonably available alternatives, if the lessee's operation would impair or preclude uses by the surface estate owner. Municipal governments have a statutory and judicially recognized authority and responsibility to regulate land use within their jurisdiction. These regulations are intended to be an exercise of that land use authority of the City in a manner that upholds the balance between municipal and state interests. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as giving the City authority to enforce state or federal laws, rules or regulations. 
(Prior code 5.24.020; Ord. 40 §2, 2006)

In any prosecution of any of the provisions governing unattended vehicles, proof that the particular vehicle described in the penalty assessment notice was left unattended in violation of any such law or regulation, together with proof that the defendant named in the penalty assessment notice was, at the time of violation, the registered owner of such vehicle, shall constitute in evidence a prima facie rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of such vehicle was the person who left the vehicle unattended at the place where, and for the time during which, such violation occurred. 
(13)  If the alleged violator is cited for a noncriminal traffic offense, he shall be privileged to answer the complaint made against him in the manner provided in the Colorado Municipal Court Rules of Procedure.

(d)  The Police Department, upon receipt of an ownership report from the Department of Motor Vehicles, shall determine, from all available information and after reasonable inquiries, whether or not the abandoned or inoperable vehicle has been reported stolen and, if so reported, the Police Department shall take such actions as it deems appropriate in accordance with established procedure.

The burden of proof shall be on the Police Department to establish probable cause for the impoundment. 
(b)  Probable cause to impound means such a state of facts as would lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe there was sufficient violation of this Article to grant legal authority for the removal of the vehicle. 
(c)  The Municipal Judge shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The person demanding the hearing shall have the burden of establishing that such person has the right to the possession of the vehicle. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Municipal Judge shall prepare a written decision. A copy of such decision shall be provided to the person demanding the hearing and the registered owner of the vehicle (if not the person requesting the hearing). The Municipal Judge's decision shall in no way affect any criminal proceeding in connection with the impound in question, and any criminal charges in such proceeding may only be challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction. The decision of the Municipal Judge shall be final. 
(d)  The Municipal Judge shall only determine that there was or was not probable cause to impound the vehicle. If the Municipal Judge finds that there was no probable cause, the vehicle shall be released to its owner and all towing and storage fees shall be paid by the City.

CHAPTER 10 - General Offenses 
ARTICLE I - General Provisions 

Sec. 10-1-10. - Authority. 
    The City adopts this Chapter relating to public peace, safety and morals in accordance with the powers granted it in Section 31-15-401, C.R.S., and the City Charter. 
(Prior code 13.02.010; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 10-1-20. - Purpose. 
    This Chapter shall be construed in such a manner as to promote maximum fulfillment of its general purposes, namely: 
(1)  To define offenses, to define adequately the act and mental state which constitute each offense, to place limitations upon the condemnation of conduct as criminal when it is without fault and to give fair warning to all persons concerning the nature of the conduct prohibited and the penalties authorized upon conviction. 
(2)  To forbid the commission of offenses, and to prevent their occurrence through the deterrent influence of the sentences authorized; and to provide for the rehabilitation of those convicted, and their punishment when required in the interest of public protection. 
(Prior code 13.02.020) 
Sec. 10-1-30. - Applicability. 
    This Article shall be applicable to all offenses defined in this Chapter, as well as any other criminal offenses prosecuted in Municipal Court. 
(Prior code 13.04.010) 
Sec. 10-1-40. - Penalties. 
(a)  All municipal misdemeanor offenses are divided into three (3) categories of municipal offenses. The classification and maximum penalties for each offense are as follows: 
Class Maximum Fine Maximum
Imprisonment A $2,000.00 One Year B $1,000.00 Six Months C $1,000.00 Ten Days  
(b)  If an offense carries a specific penalty, that penalty shall apply. 
(c)  Any offense not otherwise classified which does not carry a specific penalty is denominated as a Class A municipal offense. 
(Prior code 13.02.030; Ord. 18 §8, 2016 ; Ord. 1 §2, 2017 ) 
Sec. 10-1-50. - Definitions. 
    The following definitions are applicable to the determination of culpability requirements for offenses defined in this Chapter, as well as any other criminal offenses prosecuted in Municipal Court: 
    Act means a bodily movement, and includes words and possession of property. 
    Conduct means an act or omission and its accompanying state of mind or, where relevant, a series of acts or omissions. 
    Criminal negligence. A person acts with criminal negligence when, through a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise, he or she fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a result will occur or that a circumstance exists. 
    Culpable mental state means intentionally, with intent, knowingly, willfully, recklessly or with criminal negligence, as these terms are defined in this Section. 
    Intentionally or with intent . All criminal offenses in which the mental culpability requirement is expressed as intentionally or with intent are declared to be specific intent offenses. A person acts intentionally or with intent when his or her conscious objective is to cause the specific result proscribed by the section defining the offenses. It is immaterial to the issue of specific intent whether or not the result actually occurred. 
    Knowingly or willfully . All criminal offenses in which the mental culpability requirement is expressed as knowingly or willfully are declared to be general intent crimes. A person acts knowingly or willfully with respect to conduct or to a circumstance described by a section in this Chapter defining an offense when he or she is aware that his or her conduct is of such nature or that such circumstance exists. A person acts knowingly or willfully with respect to a result of his or her conduct when he or she is aware that his or her conduct is practically certain to cause the result. 
    Omission means a failure to perform an act as to which a duty of performance is imposed by law. 
    Recklessly . A person acts recklessly when he or she consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a result will occur or that a circumstance exists. 
    Voluntary act means an act performed consciously as a result of effort or determination, and includes the possession of property if the actor was aware of his or her physical possession or control thereof for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate it. 
(Prior code 13.04.020) 
Sec. 10-1-52. - Requirements for criminal liability. 
    The minimum requirement for criminal liability is the performance by a person of conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act which he or she is physically capable of performing. If that conduct is all that is required for commission of a particular offense or if an offense or some material element thereof does not require a culpable mental state on the part of the actor, the offense is one of "strict liability." If a culpable mental state on the part of the actor is required with respect to any material element of an offense, the offense is one of "mental culpability." (Ord. 7 §12, 2010) 
Sec. 10-1-54. - Construction of sections with respect to culpability requirements. 
(a)  When the commission of an offense, or some element of an offense, requires a particular culpable mental state, that mental state is ordinarily designated by use of the terms "intentionally," "with intent," "knowingly," "willfully," "recklessly" or "with criminal negligence." 
(b)  Although no culpable mental state is expressly designated in a section defining an offense, a culpable mental state may nevertheless be required for the commission of that offense, or with respect to some or all of the material elements thereof, if the proscribed conduct necessarily involves such a culpable mental state. 
(c)  If a section provides that criminal negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense, that element also is established if a person acts recklessly, knowingly or intentionally. If recklessness suffices to establish an element, that element also is established if a person acts knowingly or intentionally. If acting knowingly suffices to establish an element, that element also is established if a person acts intentionally. 
(d)  When a section defining an offense prescribes as an element thereof a specified culpable mental state, that mental state is deemed to apply to every element of the offense unless an intent to limit its application clearly appears. 
(Ord. 7 §12, 2010) 
Sec. 10-1-56. - Liability based upon behavior. 
    A person is guilty of an offense if it is committed by the behavior of another person for which he or she is legally accountable as provided in this Chapter. 
(Ord. 7 §12, 2010) 
Sec. 10-1-58. - Behavior of another. 
(a)  A person is legally accountable for the behavior of another person if: 
(1)  He or she is made accountable for the conduct of that person by the law defining the offense or by specific provision of this Code; or 
(2)  He or she acts with the culpable mental state sufficient for the commission of the offense in question and he or she causes an innocent person to engage in such behavior. 
(b)  As used in Subsection (a) above, innocent person includes any person who is not guilty of the offense in question, despite his or her behavior, because of duress, legal incapacity or exemption or unawareness of the criminal nature of the conduct in question or of the defendant's criminal purpose or any other factor precluding the mental state sufficient for the commission of the offense in question. 
(Ord. 7 §12, 2010) 
Sec. 10-1-60. - Criminal attempt. 
(a)  A person commits criminal attempt if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of an offense, he or she engages in conduct constituting a substantial step toward the commission of the offense. A substantial step is any conduct, whether act, omission or possession, which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor's purpose to complete the commission of the offense.

Sec. 13-3-610. - License required. 
    No wastewater hauler shall dispose of wastewater in the City's public wastewater system, whether from a source inside or outside the corporate limits of the City, without first obtaining a wastewater hauler license from the City. A license shall be obtained for each hauling vehicle used by the wastewater hauler, and such license shall be carried in the licensed vehicle at all times the licensee attempts to dispose wastewater in the City pursuant to this Article. 
( Ord. 6 §2, 2016 ) 
Sec. 13-3-620. - Issuance of license. 
    The wastewater hauler's license shall be issued by the City upon written application and completion of the following minimum requirements: 
(1)  The City shall inspect the trucks, hoses, valves, and associated equipment of the applicant for a wastewater hauler's license and determine if it meets the minimum qualifications for complying with the conditions of this chapter. Vehicles with a rated capacity in excess of four thousand (4,000) gallons will be approved only upon special authorization of the City. 
(2)  An application shall require the payment of a fee for each vehicle used by the applicant as set forth in Appendix A to this Code and the posting of a bond with reasonable surety in the penal sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for the faithful compliance with the provisions of this Article, including prompt payment of fees, fines, and damages. 
(3)  Applicants shall provide proof of general liability insurance in an aggregate amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00).

( Ord. 6 §2, 2016 ) 
Sec. 13-3-630. - Enforcement. 
(a)  The City may deny a wastewater hauler license or renewal of a license when the applicant makes a material misstatement of fact in a license application or submits an incomplete application, fails to pay fees or costs established in this Code, or has previously violated any terms and conditions of this Code. 
(b)  The City may revoke a licensee's license for a known or suspected violation by a licensee of any of the terms and conditions governing wastewater disposal established in this Article or Code, including a failure to provide sufficient or true information to the City under Section 13-3-650. Licenses may also be revoked for known or suspected deficiencies in a licensee's equipment, or abuse of the license and the privileges granted thereunder. 
(c)  No licensee shall be deemed to have acquired property rights in or to its wastewater hauler's license. 
(d)  All enforcement rights and remedies of the City provided in this Article or otherwise are cumulative and not exclusive of any other enforcement rights or remedies available to the City. The City's exercise of an enforcement right or remedy shall not preclude or prevent the City for exercising any other enforcement right or remedy. Nothing herein shall restrict the City from calling the bond required in Section 13-3-620 above for any violation of this Article. 
( Ord. 6 §2, 2016 ) 
Sec. 13-3-640. - Disposal of hauled wastewater. 
(a)  Licensees shall dispose of hauled wastewater only during normal operation hours of the City's facilities offering access to the public wastewater system, unless a written or verbal request is directed to and granted by the City at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the date the work is to be performed. Any overtime hours necessitated by a licensee's request to dispose wastewater after regular business hours shall be billed to the licensee with a fifteen percent (15%) surcharge in addition to the normal fees set forth at Section 13-3-690. 
(b)  Licensees shall dispose of hauled wastewater permitted in this Article only at a location designated by the City. Licensees shall maintain the designated location(s) in a clean and orderly condition to avoid noxious odors and unsanitary conditions. 
(c)  A licensee shall obtain per load approval from the City prior to disposing of any industrial/commercial wastewater. Industrial/commercial wastewater includes wastes generated by an industrial or commercial operation, or which otherwise meets the definition of industrial waste set forth at Section 13-3-10 of this Code. 
( Ord. 6 §2, 2016 ) 
Sec. 13-3-650. - Identification of wastewater. 
(a)  A licensee must document on a form issued by the City the nature and origin of each load of wastewater it desires to dispose of within the City and the desired site (if the City has designated more than one (1)) and method of disposal. A licensee shall provide at minimum for each load: 
(1)  The name and license number or other City designation for the licensee;

ARTICLE IV - Water and Wastewater Systems Improvement Fee 

Sec. 13-4-10. - Fee payment required. 
    Any person desiring to connect and tap onto the City water system, wastewater system or both shall be required to pay a water system improvement fee, a wastewater system improvement fee or both, in accordance with the provisions of this Article. Notwithstanding the payment of fees pursuant to the provisions of this Article, tap connections to the City water or wastewater system shall at all times be subject to availability. System improvement fees shall be nonrefundable, except as provided in Section 13-1-260 of this Chapter. 
(Prior code 10.10.010) 
Sec. 13-4-20. - Payment due date. 
(a)  Except as provided in Subsection (b) below, all system improvement fees due pursuant to this Article shall be paid at the time of the application for a building permit or, if no building permit is required, prior to City approval of the application for a connection permit. 
(b)  To assist with the economic viability of new developments in the City, nonresidential users owing system improvement fees as calculated in Section 13-4-60 of this Article may opt to pay such fees in the form of a system improvement fee surcharge as set forth herein. The system improvement fee surcharge shall replace the system improvement fee payment described in Section 13-4-10 above and shall be payable in thirty-six (36) equal, interest-free monthly installments. Monthly payments for the surcharge will commence upon application for a building permit or, if no building permit is required, prior to the change in use set forth in Section 13-4-40 below. The system improvement fee surcharge shall be billed on the statement for water and wastewater service charges set forth in Section 13-1-410 of this Chapter. Capacity in the City's water and wastewater system shall not be perpetually reserved and appurtenant to the premises served until full payment of the system improvement fees is made. All provisions of this Code which apply to charges for water and wastewater service set forth at Sections 13-1-420 through 13-1-440 of this Chapter apply to the system improvement fee surcharge. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13-1-280 of this Chapter, failure to remit payments for the system improvement fee surcharge for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months shall result in the total abandonment of the water and wastewater EQRs subject to the system improvement fee surcharge which will eliminate any lien on the premises served for the unpaid system improvement fees; provided, however, that all other fees and charges, including interest, late charges and/or delinquency fees, shall remain due and owing and subject to all collection procedures of this Code.

    EQR value means the number of EQRs associated with a particular use or class of use, calculated according to the EQR Schedule contained in Section 13-4-60 below or based on actual metered water use pursuant to Section 13-4-110, at the City's discretion. 
    Equivalent Residential Unit (EQR), as used in this Article, means a standard of measurement used by the City to calculate water and sewer fees based on the volume of water used and/or consumed and sewage produced by a single-family residential unit housing a statistical average of three and one-half (3.5) persons and having not more than five thousand (5,000) square feet of irrigated lawn or garden; which is equivalent to three hundred fifty (350) gallons of water per day. 
    Kitchen means any room used to cook, heat or prepare food, as may be evidenced by the use or existence of any of the following items: sink, refrigerator, place for food storage, stove, oven, microwave oven or hot plate. The City Manager reserves the right, in his or her discretion, to designate a given room within a residence as a kitchen; provided, however, that the existence of a stove, oven or microwave oven within a room also containing a sink and refrigerator shall conclusively establish said room as a kitchen. 
    Mobile home shall have the same meaning as set forth in Sections 16-1-220 and 18-1-90 of this Code.

Sec. 13-4-110. - Review of service levels and fee. 
    For purposes of computing and recomputing the number of EQR units attributable to a particular use and the assessment and collection of water and wastewater system improvement fees and service charges in connection therewith, the City shall have the following authority: 
(1)  At any time, the City may review actual water usage to determine if such actual usage is greater than that implied by the number of EQR units assessed to the user at the time application for water and/or sewer services was accepted. For this purpose, three hundred fifty (350) gallons per day equals one (1) EQR. Winter water use records may be utilized to review actual sewer usage, and water use records from any time of the year, at the City's sole discretion, may be utilized to review actual water usage. If the City finds greater actual water and/or sewer usage than that implied by the applicable EQR value, the user shall be assessed a greater number of EQR units to reflect the actual sewer usage. Any time the City determines to evaluate or reevaluate the appropriate EQR value assessed to a particular user, it shall provide written notice to the user at the user's last known address. 
(2)  Upon any recalculation and increase in the EQR value attributable to a user pursuant to the terms of this Section, the user shall pay additional water and/or wastewater system improvement fees for each additional EQR unit assessed to its use at the rates set forth in this Article prior to the City's issuance of any necessary permit or within thirty (30) days of the increased assessment of EQR units, whichever occurs first. The user's monthly service fee will henceforth be based upon the revised EQR value. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the general provisions of this Article or the particular provisions of this Section, nothing herein is intended automatically to modify, revise or amend the terms of any prior individualized assessment or agreement memorialized by a writing or reflected in the minutes, resolutions or ordinances of the City Council, nor shall it prevent such modification, revision or amendment at the sole discretion of the City Council.

(a)  Purpose. The City hereby establishes review standards and procedures concerning requests for water and sewer service by high-volume users of such service, to ensure that adequate water and sewer service is provided to all residential, commercial and industrial users and entities requesting service. The City seeks to minimize service capacity shortages by providing adequate capital construction and planning, design and construction lead time for expansion and enhancement of water and sewer facilities. City Council review of requests for high volume users will enhance the equitable distribution of the existing plant capacity among all entities seeking service. 
(b)  Definition. For purposes of this Section, a high volume use request is defined as follows: 
(1)  Any request for one (1) or more water taps by a residential, commercial or industrial user or entity, such tap being two (2) inches in diameter or larger, exclusive of fire flow requirements. 
(2)  Any single request or combination of requests for water taps by a residential, commercial or industrial user or entity totaling five million three hundred fifty thousand (5,350,000) gallons per year based upon the projected demand of such user or entity using generally accepted engineering standards. 
(3)  Any single request or combination of requests for one (1) or more sewer taps by a residential, commercial or industrial user or development entity exceeding ten percent (10%) of the total capacity or twenty percent (20%) of the remaining capacity of the receiving sewer plant, based upon the projected demand of such user or entity using generally accepted engineering standards. For purposes of this Paragraph (3), capacity shall mean either hydraulic capacity or organic capacity as contained in the permits for the receiving waste water plant issued by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. 
(4)  For the purpose of determining what constitutes a combination of requests, as that phrase is used in Paragraphs (2) and (3) above, the reasonably foreseeable cumulative demand of any project, subdivision, planned unit development or other land use proposal for residential, commercial or industrial development, or any combination of such development, over the next succeeding ten-year period, shall be considered the combination of requests for water or sewer service. 
(c)  City Council review of high volume use requests. Before water or sewer service will be extended by the for a high volume use request, the user or entity shall make a written application to the City and pay an application fee as set forth in Appendix A to this Code, on such forms as may be prepared by the City for such purpose. The application shall include all information requested by the City as necessary to properly evaluate the application. Upon receipt of any high volume use request for water or sewer service and determination that such application is complete, the Public Works Director shall notify the applicant that the high volume use request is to be added to the agenda of the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting; provided, however, that such high volume use request must be made a minimum of fourteen (14) days prior to the City Council meeting. The City Council shall review the high volume use request at the scheduled City Council meeting and any continuation of such meeting that may be necessary to properly evaluate the application, and shall provide a written determination of acceptance or rejection of the request at the next regular Council meeting following such review. 
(d)  Review of the high volume use request shall be limited to consideration of the following factors: 
(1)  Community impact on employment, including jobs gained, jobs lost and relative wage change; 
(2)  Potential increases or decreases in sales tax and property tax revenues; 
(3)  Community impact on transportation; 
(4)  Impact on public agencies, including but not limited to the Fire District and the City School District; 
(5)  Timing, phasing, density and location of project development if the applicant seeks a high volume use request for the purposes of project development; 
(6)  Location of the applicant, inside or outside the incorporated areas of the City; 
(7)  Incremental impacts on water and sewer plants, infrastructure and remaining capacity, including evaluation of peak hourly, daily, seasonal and annual demands; and 
(8)  The status of planning for infrastructure upgrades, including available financing for such improvements. 
(e)  The City may approve, approve with conditions or deny the request. Approval may be contingent upon conditions imposed by the City Council for the purposes of promoting an equitable distribution of water and sewer service for all potential users and providing for the orderly and efficient expansion of the City's water and sewer infrastructure. Such conditions may include, by way of example and not by way of limitation: Limitations on the number of water or sewer taps available to the user or entity in any given year of a phased project; contributions in aid of capital construction or other financial participation in infrastructure upgrades; deferral of the actual extension of water or sewer service pending completion of required permitting for or construction of additional plant capacity; or mutually agreeable periods of operation or use to minimize impacts on infrastructure periods of peak loading.

    Equivalent residential unit ("EQR") as used in this Article means a number related to the volume of water consumptively used by a single-family residential unit housing a statistical average of three and one-half (3.5) persons and having not more than five thousand (5,000) square feet of irrigated lawn or garden. The water consumption for each EQR is three-tenths (0.3) acre-feet per year if wastewater is returned to the Colorado River system by the City's municipal wastewater treatment facilities or any other wastewater treatment facilities equal in efficiency and similar in return flow patterns to the City's wastewater treatment facilities. For deliveries to demand utilizing wastewater treatment facilities which are one hundred percent (100%) consumptive in nature without material effluent return flows to the Colorado River, the water consumption for each EQR is seventy-five one-hundredths (.75) acre-foot per year. For deliveries to water uses not utilizing the City's municipal wastewater treatment facilities, it is assumed that no return flows are generated to the Colorado River system; this presumption may be rebutted by licensed professional engineer's analysis of actual return flow efficiency of the wastewater system to be utilized. If wastewater efficiencies are less than those of City sewer facilities but greater than a system which is totally consumptive, the water consumption per EQR shall be modified by the appropriate fraction. The consumptive use of all other uses shall be calculated using the same ration of annual consumptive use to EQR value of a single-family residence (0.3 acre-foot of c.u. to 1.0 EQR) as assigned herein and in the EQR Schedule in Section 13-4-60. 
    EQR Schedule means the City EQR Schedule contained in Section 13-4-60 of this Chapter, as the same may be amended from time to time. 
    Extensions of service means any extension of the municipal water utility for which a tapping charge is assessed. 
    Historical use affidavit means a document which sets forth the following information concerning the water rights proposed for dedication: 
a.  The names and addresses of the owners of the water rights proposed for dedication; 
b.  A legal description of the land to be annexed or provided with municipal water service; 
c.  The total number of acres to be annexed or provided with municipal water service; 
d.  The total number of acres presently being irrigated and/or intended to remain in irrigation; 
e.  A copy of all decrees concerning all water rights appurtenant to the property and/or all water rights proposed for dedication; 
f.  A copy of any legal decree or judgment which affects the title of those water rights entered since the owner received title to the water rights appurtenant to the property and/or proposed for dedication; 
g.  A copy of the documents by which the owner received title to the water rights appurtenant to the property and/or proposed for dedication; 
h.  A copy of all diversion records of the water rights proposed for dedication; and 
i.  The owner's statement as to the historic use of the water rights appurtenant to the property and/or proposed for dedication. 
    Lease means any grant for permissive use which results in the creation of a landlord-tenant relationship. 
    Plat means an accurately surveyed map or chart of a piece of land subdivided into lots with streets, alleys, roads and other such avenues of transportation delineated thereon and drawn to a scale. 
    Replat means to make a change in the original plat. 
    Subdivide means to separate a tract of land into two (2) or more lots, tracts, parcels, sites, separate interests in common, condominium interests or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of transfer of ownership, for building or other development, or for street use by reference to such subdivision or a recorded plat thereof. 
    Sufficient legal priority means that the water rights proposed for dedication may reasonably be expected to provide a dependable water supply throughout the season of use in the amount for which they are decreed. In making this determination, factors to be considered shall include, but not by way of limitation, the adjudication date and appropriation date of the water rights, the decreed use, the historic use of the water under the decree, the physical flow available and the administration practices of the office of the State Engineer. 
    Transfer of water rights means the conveyance of legal title to water rights to the City, in addition to referring to all actions required under state law to be brought in the water court to ensure that the dedication requirement is fulfilled. Such action may include, but not by way of limitation, a change in the type, place or time of use; a change in the point of diversion; a change from a fixed point of diversion to alternate or supplemental points of diversion; a change from alternate or supplemental points of diversion to a fixed point of diversion; a change in the means of diversion; a change in the place of storage; a change from direct application to storage and subsequent application; a change from storage and subsequent application to direct application; a change from a fixed place of storage to alternate places of storage; a change from alternate places of storage; or any combination of such changes. Transfer of water rights includes transfer of conditional as well as absolute water rights. 
    Water right means a decreed right to use in accordance with its priority a certain portion of the waters of the State by reason of the appropriation of the same. 
(Prior code 10.20.030; Ord. 29 §50, 2004; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 13-6-30. - Basic dedication requirement. 
(a)  A dedication or transfer of direct flow and/or storage water rights to the City shall be required prior to the approval of the annexation of any land to the City, prior to all extensions of municipally treated water service outside the City limits as they existed on the effective date of this Article as originally codified, and prior to the subdivision or replatting of any land now located within the City, if such subdivision or replatting requires a change of zone district. 
(b)  The dedication requirement shall be calculated in accordance with Subsection (c) below on forms provided by the City Manager. Such forms shall be accompanied by a historical use affidavit. For those persons whose compliance with Subsection (c) results in a total EQR value greater than thirty (30) EQRs, no historical use affidavit shall be required; however, an engineering analysis, acceptable to the City, of the historic use of the water rights proposed for dedication shall be required. 
(c)  The basic dedication requirement shall be three-tenths (0.3) acre-foot per year of historic consumptive use of a water right of sufficient legal priority for each EQR calculated under the EQR Schedule. For water service to uses not connected to or utilizing the City's municipal wastewater treatment facilities, the basic dedication requirement shall be seventy-five hundredths (0.75) acre-foot per year of historic consumptive use of a water right of sufficient legal priority for each EQR calculated under the EQR Schedule. For uses not calculated under the EQR Schedule, the basic requirement shall be the quantity of water to be required ultimately in the satisfaction of those uses contemplated by the new user, as calculated by the Public Works Manager. If a party required to dedicate water pursuant to this Article can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that his or her actual use will be less than that calculated by reference to the EQR Schedule, he or she shall be required to dedicate only the lesser amount, it being the intent of this Article that the quantity of water dedicated be that quantity of water required ultimately in the satisfaction of the use contemplated by the party. 
(d)  The basic requirement shall be satisfied by the person seeking approval of annexation, subdivision, replatting or the extension of municipally treated water service, whether or not that person will be the ultimate user. 
(e)  Sufficient water rights shall be dedicated so as to enable the City to divert a quantity of water at any point of diversion it may determine, which will allow for the total consumption by the City of the quantities set forth in Subsection (b) above. 
(f)  For all customers utilizing a raw water irrigation system meeting the requirements of Article VII of this Chapter, the basic dedication requirement shall be reduced by seventy-five percent (75%) of the total amount calculated pursuant to the EQR Schedule, which reduction shall be applicable whether the customer dedicates water rights to the City or pays a cash amount equal to the fair market value of the water rights necessary to satisfy the basic dedication requirement pursuant to Paragraph 13-6-60(b)(1) below; provided, however, that if raw water irrigation is discontinued, the customer shall be responsible for seventy-five percent (75%) of the basic dedication requirement in effect at that time. 
(Prior code 10.20.040; Ord. 29 §51, 2004; Ord. 4 §1, 2005; Ord. 10 §3, 2009; Ord. 19 §2, 2009) 
Sec. 13-6-40. - Dedication of water rights for open space. 
    The owner of any property proposed to be annexed or subdivided, who dedicates property to the City pursuant to Section 16-1-90 of this Code to be used for open space, park, aesthetic, recreation or irrigation purposes, shall also comply with the provisions of this Article for the property to be dedicated. 
(Prior code 10.20.050) 
Sec. 13-6-50. - Exceptions. 
(a)  The City Council may substitute or waive any conditions or requirements deemed necessary to meet the purposes of this Article. 
(b)  This Article does not apply to the extension of new municipal treated water service or raw water service for which the basic dedication requirement has been previously complied with by any person. 
(Prior code 10.20.060) 
Sec. 13-6-60. - Procedure. 
(a)  In accordance with the basic requirements set forth in Section 13-6-30 above, the City Manager shall determine, after consultation with a person skilled in the knowledge of water rights, whether the water rights proposed for dedication pursuant to the provisions of this Article will be of sufficient priority under the laws of the State to ensure the City's ability to meet the service demands of the new user. This determination will be aided by an historic use affidavit or engineering report which shall be provided by the new user. 
(b)  The City shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to accept or reject any water rights proposed for dedication pursuant to the provisions of this Article which the City Manager has determined do not have sufficient legal priority. If the City Manager determines that the proposed water rights fail to satisfy the basic dedication requirement, the following alternatives, or combination thereof, may be used to otherwise satisfy the basic dedication requirement: 
(1)  The person required to comply with the basic dedication requirement may pay to the City a cash amount equal to the fair market value of the water rights necessary to satisfy the basic dedication requirement. 
(2)  The City Manager may, in his or her discretion, negotiate with the new user to establish other terms or conditions which shall constitute compliance with the basic dedication requirement of this Article. 
(c)  The new user shall dedicate the water rights determined by the City by filing with the City Manager an offer thereof. It is the intent of this Article that no water service shall be extended to a new user until the agreed-to water rights have been dedicated to the City; however, if there are matters pending resolution in the water court concerning the water rights to be dedicated or if there is other delay beyond the control of the new user, the City Manager shall have the discretion to approve the extension of such water service prior to the dedication of water rights to the City by the new user or person seeking approval of annexation, subdivision or replatting, new extension of municipal treated water service or extension of raw water service which will thereafter be used for domestic purposes. 
(d)  All costs and expenses attendant to the conveyance and transfer of water rights dedicated to the City shall be borne by the new user; however, in no event shall a new user be responsible for any expenses or costs of transfer in excess of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each cubic foot per second of water, or fraction thereof, to be dedicated. 
(e)  Any decision made by the City Manager under the delegation of powers contained within this Article shall be submitted by him or her to the City Council at its next regular meeting, and the decision shall not become final until the same has been ratified by the City Council. Any interested parties shall have the opportunity to be heard with respect to the decision. 
(Prior code 10.20.070; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 13-6-70. - Agricultural and open space property lease. 
    If the owner of the property proposed to be annexed or subdivided desires to retain the land or any portion thereof in agricultural production or as open space prior to development, he or she shall be permitted to lease back, on an annual basis and for irrigation, aesthetic and recreational purposes only, the water rights transferred pursuant to this Article. The terms of the lease shall be negotiated with the City Manager. 
(Prior code 10.20.080) 
Sec. 13-6-80. - Option to purchase. 
(a)  Time. Any person required to comply with the basic dedication requirement shall also grant to the City the option to purchase any and all water rights which are appurtenant to the land to be annexed but which are in excess of the basic dedication requirement. The option may be exercised by the City at any time for a period of one (1) year following the date of the grant to the City with regard to any or all of the water rights subject to the grant. 
(b)  Price. 
(1)  The option price shall be that price agreed upon by the parties. If the parties do not agree upon an option price within thirty (30) days after notice of the City's intent to exercise its option is received by the owner, appraisal at the City's expense will establish the price that reflects the fair market value of the water rights. 
(2)  The appraisal shall be conducted by one (1) appraiser appointed by the City, one (1) appraiser appointed by the owner of the water rights, and a third appraiser who shall be appointed by both parties. The average of the three (3) appraisals shall be the option price. 
(c)  Right of first refusal. 
(1)  Grant of right. In addition to the grant of the option to purchase by the new user, there shall be a grant to the City by the user of a right of first refusal regarding the water rights subject to said option to purchase. If the City for any reason should choose not to exercise its option to purchase, it shall retain the right of first refusal in the event the water rights are sold independently of the land, for a period of ten (10) years following annexation, final approval, replatting or extension of water service to a subdivision. 
(2)  Notice period. If the owner of the water rights subject to the right of first refusal wishes to sell the water rights to a third party, he or she shall give to the City at least ninety (90) days' notice of his or her intention to effect a sale of the water rights by delivering to the City a bona fide written offer to purchase made by a third party. 
(3)  Exercise of right. During the ninety-day notice period provided for in this Subsection, the City shall enjoy its right of first refusal entitling it to purchase the water rights proposed for sale. If, within ninety (90) days following notice by the owner of his or her intention to sell his or her water rights, the City chooses to exercise its right of purchase, the City shall pay to the owner the fair market price of the water rights prevailing at the time of the offer, which price shall be at least equal to the amount tendered to the owner in a bona fide offer by the third party. In the event the City determines not to exercise its right to purchase the water rights offered for sale, the owner shall be free to sell the water rights to a third party; provided, however, that any such sale to a third party shall be for a price which is at least equal to that price which was tendered to and refused by the City.

For every annexation, subdivision or residential development, the City Council shall require the dedication of certain sites for parks and recreational use, and may require the reservation of sites for school and other public purposes. Land dedicated may include the one-hundred-year floodplain, national and state historical or natural features, and proposed public areas set aside in state, regional, county or city comprehensive plans. Land dedicated shall not include sites for private schools, sites for service organizations which are not open to the general public and sites unsuitable for public use due to steep slopes, rock formations, adverse topography, utility easements or other features which may be harmful to the health and safety of the citizens. These requirements shall not apply in cases where satisfactory dedication arrangements were made and approved by the City Council at the time of annexation or previous subdivision of the same property. 
(b)  Method and amount of land dedicated. 
(1)  The subdivider shall convey to the City by means of a final plat dedication, or shall deed land to be used for public recreation at locations designated by the City, in the following manner: 
a.  The subdivider shall dedicate to the City land in the ratio of eight and ninety-sixth hundredths (8.96) acres for every one thousand (1,000) residents of the proposed subdivision or development; 
b.  For the purpose of the foregoing requirement, the number of residents attributable to each subdivision shall be: 
1.  Single-family dwellings, three and one-half (3.5) residents per unit. 
2.  Two-family dwellings, three (3.0) residents per unit. 
3.  Multi-family dwellings, two and one-half (2.5) residents per unit. 
4.  For planned unit developments or where the number of units is known because of a proposed master plan, the number of units proposed shall govern. 
(2)  Commercial and industrial developments within the City are exempt from the requirements of this Section, and there shall be no parkland dedication requirement imposed on such development. 
(3)  A minimum of eighty percent (80%) of the land dedicated shall lend itself to utilization for public recreation purposes which includes, but is not limited to, the following: trails, play fields, tennis courts, picnic sites and boating areas. 
(c)  Reservation of land for schools and other public agencies. 
(1)  If requested by a public agency, the City Council may require a subdivider or developer to reserve land areas sufficient for development of school or other public agency facilities. A public agency includes the State or any political subdivision thereof. 
(2)  Land reserved shall, by the nature of its natural topography, soil condition and connecting utilities, lend itself to development of the desired facility. 
(3)  Land reserved shall be purchased by the public agency at its fair market value as determined below, according to the following schedule: 
a.  Within ninety (90) days following approval of the final plat, the requesting agency and the subdivider or developer shall enter into an option agreement for a period of no greater than one (1) year, with a renewal provision for one (1) additional year. 
b.  When the option is signed, the public agency shall deposit with an escrow agent an amount which shall be determined by the public agency and the developer to equal the actual costs and expenses, plus ten percent (10%), of the costs of replatting the subdivision if the option is not exercised. In the event the public agency and developer cannot agree upon the estimated expenses, the City Manager shall make the determination. In the event the option is extended for an additional year, the public agency shall deposit an additional ten percent (10%) of the estimated costs and expenses with the escrow agent. 
c.  For the purpose of this Section, the fair market value of the land reserved shall be the value of the raw, undeveloped land, plus a proportionate share, as they benefit the reserved land, of the actual cost of the improvements required by the subdivider or developer. 
d.  In the event the public agency and the subdivider or developer cannot agree as to the fair market value, the parties shall submit the matter to binding arbitration under such rules and regulations as the City Council may, by resolution, prescribe. 
(d)  Cash payment in lieu of dedication. 
(1)  At the option of the City Council, the subdivider or developer may be required, on or before final passage of the ordinance approving the subdivision, to pay to the City in cash or to transfer other property in lieu of land dedication. The amount of cash payment shall be as determined by this Section for the fee. If the City Council determines to accept other property instead of, or as a partial payment toward, the cash payment required hereunder, the City Council shall determine the value of the other property. 
(2)  Payment in lieu of land dedication shall be made prior to final approval of the ordinance approving the subdivision, and such payment shall be placed in a recreation fund to be established and maintained by the City for the acquisition of land and for the improvement of parks, playgrounds, trails and recreation areas in the City, and may benefit the residents of the City in general, as well as those of the proposed subdivision. 
(3)  The fee which may be accepted in lieu of land dedication shall be established each year as of January 1 by the City Council upon a recommendation from the Planning Commission.

Fees shall be based on the average cost of vacant undeveloped residential land within the corporate limits of the City. 
(4)  In extraordinary circumstances, the City Council may authorize the deferral of the payment of cash in lieu of dedication as required by this Section. In such event, the owner of the property shall agree with the City, in such form as shall be acceptable to the City Council, to pay such sums at the time of the issuance of any building permit upon the property. Notice shall be given of such deferred payment by the recording of a first mortgage or other security instrument with the County Clerk and Recorder. In no event, however, shall the deferral of any dedication fee required by this Section extend for a period of greater than five (5) years from the date it would otherwise be payable. The developer shall agree to pay the higher of the dedication fee calculated in accordance with this Section at the time originally owed or at the time actually paid.

(c)  Traffic and road impact study. To determine the amount of off-site street impact fees to be assessed for all nonresidential units and uses, a traffic and road impact study shall be prepared at the applicant's expense by a registered professional engineer. The impact study shall address traffic counts, weight loads, size of vehicles and timing of the impact, among other items which may be required by the City Manager. The City Manager shall review the results of each traffic and road impact study in a timely manner and make a determination as to the amount of off-site traffic impact fees necessary to offset the proposed development impacts. The applicant will be required to pay such fees according to the terms established in subsections (a) and (b), above. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the City Manager may appeal the same in writing to the City Council, by filing a written demand therefor, within fifteen (15) days after the City Manager provides notice of the amount of off-site street impact fees to be assessed.

Division 6 - Planned Unit Developments 

Sec. 16-3-610. - Intent of PUD regulations. 
    Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) are intended to promote the most beneficial and creative development of land areas in the City. PUDs permit greater flexibility in many aspects of development, including but not limited to the mixture of land uses, open space, setbacks, parking and streets. In exchange for the flexibility afforded by the PUD process, PUDs shall have innovative and exceptional design that improves upon the standards of conventional zoning. PUDs shall provide benefits to the City such as high quality project design, transportation amenities, community facilities, open space, affordable housing or other benefits. PUDs shall conform to the City Comprehensive Plan, as may be amended, and other approved plans of the City. (Prior code 17.03.510; Ord. 4 §1, 2005; Ord. 36 §3, 2007) 
Sec. 16-3-620. - Permitted locations. 
    A PUD may be permitted in any zoning district in the City subject to the review of the Planning Commission and approval of the City Council. (Prior code 17.03.520) 
Sec. 16-3-630. - Review process. 
    PUDs shall be reviewed by the City staff, Planning Commission and City Council pursuant to the provisions of Article V of this Chapter. PUD approval or conditional approval is granted only in conjunction with approval or conditional approval of subdivision preliminary plans and final plats. 
(1)  Preapplication conference. Applicants shall meet with City staff prior to submittal of any PUD application per the requirements of Section 16-5-120 of this Chapter. 
(2)  Concept plan/sketch plan review. The applicant shall submit a PUD concept plan and subdivision sketch plan concurrently for review by the Planning Commission as provided in Article V of this Chapter. Submittal requirements are the same as for sketch plans as specified in Article VI of this Chapter. 
(3)  Preliminary development plan and PUD rezoning. PUD preliminary development plans are reviewed by the Planning Commission and City Council pursuant to the provisions for the review of subdivision preliminary plans and rezoning as specified in Article V. A three-dimensional image of the PUD, created using Sketchup or a similar program, is required at the preliminary plan stage in order to represent the bulk and massing of the project to the City. 
(4)  Final development plan. PUD final development plans are reviewed by the Planning Commission and the City Council in conjunction with the review of the final plat associated with the PUD. (Prior code 17.03.530; Ord. 4 §1, 2005; Ord. 36 §4, 2007) 
Sec. 16-3-640. - Review criteria. 
(a)  General. PUDs shall be reviewed against the Planning Commission and City Council review criteria specified in Article V of this Chapter. 
Additionally, the review criteria for PUDs are divided into eleven (11) themes, each including criteria by which the City will evaluate PUDs. Some criteria are mandatory, while other criteria are encouraged. In order to be approved by the City, a PUD shall incorporate enough of the encouraged criteria to justify the flexibility afforded by the PUD process. Each PUD will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in order to balance flexibility with benefits to the City. Themes (b)(1) through (b)(6) describe benefits that the City may receive from a PUD. Themes (b)(7) through (b)(11) describe areas of flexibility that the City may consider depending on the benefits provided by the PUD. The themes are intended to be interrelated so that individual criteria often reference and are dependent upon other criteria. 
(b)  Review criteria themes: 
City benefits: 
(1)  Project design and land use. 
(2)  Architecture and design. 
(3)  Perimeter criteria. 
(4)  Affordable housing. 
(5)  Energy efficiency measures. 
(6)  Parks and open space. 
Areas of Flexibility: 
(7)  Streets. 
(8)  Setbacks. 
(9)  Off-street parking. 
(10)  Lot size. 
(11)  Signage. 
(c)  Description of review criteria: 
(1)  Project design and land use. 

An interconnected neighborhood that connects different uses is preferred to cul-de-sacs and separated uses. 
a.  The PUD should integrate a variety of housing types and commercial uses through an interconnected street network oriented towards pedestrian activity. Traditional neighborhood design is favored over conventional design. Smaller projects or projects with specific site constraints may only have a single land use or fewer street connections but must still meet as many criteria as possible. 
b.  Adjacent land uses shall be compatible with one (1) another and with adjacent developments. 
c.  Mixed-use buildings (residential dwellings above compatible commercial or office uses) are encouraged. 
d.  Commercial "strip" development that separates buildings from the street with large parking lots is discouraged. Commercial development oriented towards pedestrians and adjacent neighborhoods is encouraged. In a residential PUD, commercial uses will be evaluated based on the architectural and design criteria and the economic benefit to the to the City. 

This picture illustrates how a large retail center can avoid being a "strip" center. Parking is behind the building, office uses are on the second floor and windows make the building transparent. 
(2)  Architectural and design criteria. PUD architecture and building design shall demonstrate the cohesive planning of the development and present a clearly identifiable design feature throughout, while also demonstrating creativity in the design of individual lots. A successful PUD will include a diversity of building styles and types that create an attractive living environment, as promoted by the following criteria: 
a.  The same exterior building elevation shall not repeat itself within three hundred twenty (320) feet of street frontage, or four (4) consecutive building lots. 
b.  A variety of building materials should be utilized, including colors that vary but are selected for compatibility. 
c.  Buildings should be "articulated" by breaking up flat surfaces with balconies, stepbacks, projections and other three-dimensional details that create shadow lines. 
d.  If garages are accessed from the street, garages shall be set back a minimum of five (5) feet behind the front of the house, so that the garage is not the dominant visual feature of the structure. 
e.  The rear of a building shall not front on a local or collector street. The preferred building orientation is for building entrances to front the street. It is also acceptable for the side of a building to front a street if it is a corner lot. The intent of this requirement is to encourage a livable streetscape that avoids "dead streets" and integrates adjacent neighborhoods. This requirement is applicable to every street except those that have pre-existing conditions that make houses facing the street undesirable or impossible. 
f.  Commercial and multi-family residential building design should be oriented towards pedestrians, as provided for by the following criteria: 
1.  Place parking on the side or rear of buildings rather than the front of buildings. 
2.  Build up to the sidewalk and include an entrance from the sidewalk. 
3.  For commercial uses, make the building front "permeable" through windows and doors. 
4.  The design of commercial, multi-family, or mixed use buildings will be evaluated based on the building's relationship to the streetscape - the mass and bulk of the building should be at an appropriate ratio to the width of the street. 

(3)  Perimeter criteria. The PUD shall take into account the use and character of adjacent neighborhoods to ensure that the PUD is compatible with its surroundings. The perimeter streets and boundaries of the PUD shall conform to the following standards: 
a.  If the use, character or intensity of the PUD is not compatible with adjacent neighborhoods, the nuisance shall be minimized through appropriate setbacks, landscaping and screening. 

The tendency of PUDs is often to isolate themselves from their surroundings, which can result in dead streets. 
b.  If the PUD is compatible with surrounding neighborhoods (or with what is likely to be developed in the future), the neighborhoods shall be integrated to the maximum extent possible in order to prevent isolated neighborhoods and "dead streets" between developments. Perimeter streets shall serve as the "glue" between adjacent developments. This is provided for by the following criteria: 
1.  Buildings shall front on the perimeter streets of the PUD so that they face out of the development unless the condition of adjacent properties is undesirable or the circumstances of the site dictate otherwise. 
2.  Stub-outs on streets shall allow for future connections to undeveloped parcels. 
3.  Frequent intersections with perimeter roads shall connect the interior street network with the exterior street network. If an adjacent development includes a stub-out or intersecting road, the PUD shall continue the street into the development. 
4.  When appropriate, higher intensity uses such as townhomes, condos, parks, community facilities and commercial uses shall be located on perimeter streets to keep traffic off of minor streets and to amenitize perimeter streets. 
5.  Landscaping, street trees and sidewalks shall be included on perimeter streets. 
6.  Consideration of appropriate uses, setbacks and character of perimeter streets shall account for expected traffic volume. 
(4)  Affordable housing. PUDs shall seek to adopt strategies to increase the supply of affordable housing. Affordable housing is a benefit to the City that can be exchanged for flexibility in other areas. Examples of affordable housing strategies include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a.  Deed restrictions on the price of housing. With this strategy, the price of certain housing units remains affordable to residents who make a set percentage of the median income (often fifty percent [50%] or eighty percent [80%]). Developers should work with a local housing authority to determine the appropriate pricing structure. 
b.  Owner-occupancy requirements. This strategy places deed restrictions on whom may own the housing. By limiting ownership to residents who derive ninety percent (90%) of their income from the City, speculation is prevented and housing costs are kept down. 
c.  Partnerships with essential workforce providers. Developers may partner with the school system, the hospital or other essential employers to provide deed-restricted employee housing. 
d.  Cash contributions to the County Housing Authority. These funds shall be used specifically for City housing. 
e.  Size restrictions. Developers can provide more affordable housing by building smaller units that cost less. 
(5)  Energy efficiency measures. PUDs shall seek to adopt energy efficiency measures that decrease the amount of water, energy or waste that households or businesses generate, and builders are encouraged to look to the LEED and Energy Star systems for guidance on green building strategies. Some of the key energy saving measures of LEED and Energy Star include: 
a.  Building design and orientation. Buildings should be oriented to face within twenty percent (20%) of due south for maximum solar exposure and designed for day-lighting that reduces the need for electricity. Trees should be placed strategically to maximize energy savings. Recycling bins can be built into homes. 
b.  Water conservation. Grey water systems, rainfall capture for lawn-watering, xeriscaping and low-use toilets and faucets are among strategies that can conserve water. 
c.  Construction techniques. Energy needs can be reduced through the use of proper insulation, reduction of leaks, light-colored roofs, green roofs and energy-efficient windows and doors. Energy Star-rated appliances, efficient heating and cooling systems and compact fluorescent lamps can be installed. 
d.  Building materials. Using local or recycled materials can cut down on energy use. Construction waste should be recycled. 
e.  Renewable energy sources. Buildings can incorporate solar or geothermal power systems or be designed so that these systems may be included in the future. 
(6)  Parks and open space criteria. Parks and open space shall be integrated within the PUD. Multi-family and higher density environments necessitate a variety of common open space and recreational opportunities. While there is no specific requirement for open space as a minimum percentage of total project area, as a general rule, required total acreage may be offset by the high quality of a particular open space plan. 
a.  All housing shall be within a one-quarter-mile, five-minute walk of at least a half-acre park. 
b.  Open space and parks shall be useful to residents and incorporate both passive and active recreational opportunities. 
c.  Environmentally sensitive areas must be preserved. 
d.  The PUD shall include trails and bike paths that connect to destinations outside the development whenever possible. 
(7)  Setbacks. 
a.  Setbacks within a PUD are flexible to an extent. Setbacks interior to a privately owned area (side setbacks, rear setbacks and setbacks from private driveways) shall meet all fire and building codes of the City. Exterior setbacks (those that front a public right-of-way) shall meet the following minimum standards: 
1.  Single family units: fifteen-foot front yard setbacks. 
2.  Multi-family dwellings or townhouses: ten-foot front yard setbacks. 
3.  Commercial or mixed-use buildings: Zero (0) setbacks may be approved if an analysis of the architecture and design of the building and the relationship between the building's mass and bulk and the width of the street warrants it. 
4.  In exceptional circumstances, the City may authorize even smaller setbacks than those provided above if warranted by the benefits provided by the PUD. 
b.  In order for a PUD to include setbacks that are smaller than those of the underlying conventional zoning district, the PUD development plan shall ensure that smaller setbacks will contribute to, and be accompanied by, the following benefits: 
1.  Sufficient parks and open space (see Subsection (c)(6)), such that public recreational opportunities offset the loss of private yard space. 
2.  A greater diversity of housing types and mixed use. 
3.  An attractive streetscape and pleasant pedestrian environment (see street criteria and architectural and design criteria). 
4.  Affordable housing. 
c.  Reduced setbacks shall also avoid creating substantial negative impacts, such as: 
1.  Difficulties in the provision of public utilities and services. 
2.  Unnecessary traffic congestion. 
3.  Nuisances to property owners. 
4.  Unsafe building design (must meet all City fire and building codes). 
(8)  Streets. The maximum street width in PUDs shall be the street standards described in the Public Works Manual-thirty-six (36) feet for local and collector residential streets and forty (40) feet for commercial collector streets. PUDs may include narrower streets if certain criteria are met in order to prevent traffic congestion and provide emergency service access. The following street standards apply to all streets in PUDs. When more stringent criteria for narrower streets are required, those are also stated. 
_____

a.  An interconnected street network in the form of a grid-like pattern that eliminates cul-de-sacs is encouraged in order to provide emergency vehicles with at least two (2) access points to each structure, improve pedestrian access and create multiple routes from origins to destinations. This requirement is mandatory for narrower streets to ensure adequate emergency service. 
b.  Sidewalks must be at least five (5) feet to eight (8) feet in width and on both sides of the street. 
c.  Landscaping strips with street trees shall separate streets from the sidewalks. 
d.  Blocks must be no longer than six hundred forty (640) feet without being broken up by an intersection. For narrower streets, blocks should be in the three hundred (300) feet to four hundred (400) feet range in length. 
e.  Bulb-outs and pedestrian crossings shall be included to promote pedestrian activity. 
f.  The design of streets and parking shall allow for adequate fire lanes. For narrower streets, a parking enforcement plan and other measures to provide adequate fire lanes must be included to ensure that emergency access is preserved. 
g.  On-street bike lanes are encouraged on collector streets. 
(9)  Off-street parking: 
a.  Except for the following circumstances, parking shall comply with the requirements of Article VII of this Chapter: 
1.  When the probable number of cars owned by occupants of dwellings in the PUD is fewer than the accepted City average (e.g., elderly housing); 
2.  For nonresidential uses; or 
3.  When joint use of common parking areas is proposed with varying time periods of use. 
b.  Whenever the number of off-street parking spaces is reduced because of the nature of the occupancy, the developer shall provide the City with adequate assurances that the nature of the occupancy will not change. 
c.  The City Council shall have discretion to grant parking reductions up to twenty percent (20%), provided that no parking reductions shall be granted for developments requiring three (3) or fewer parking spaces. 
(10)  Lot size. A PUD may receive flexibility with the lot size requirements of the underlying zone district, which are six thousand (6,000) feet for residential zones. 
(11)  Signage. A PUD may receive flexibility with the City's sign code regulations. (Prior code 17.03.540; Ord. 36 §5, 2007) 
Sec. 16-3-650. - Effect of designation. 
(a)  Approval of a PUD shall have the effect of overlaying the existing zoning and thereby adding to and modifying the existing zoning regulations. If there is conflict between the provisions of the existing zoning description and the PUD, the regulation of the underlying zone shall apply unless specifically addressed in the provisions of the approved PUD. 
(b)  When a PUD is approved by the City Council, the zoning designation for that lot, tract or parcel on the official zoning map shall include the suffix "PUD". An approved site for a PUD that is zoned LDR would then have the designation "LDR-PUD." (Prior code 17.03.550) 
Sec. 16-3-660. - Application submittal requirements. 
    Applications for approval of PUDs shall comply with the submittal requirements specified in Article VI of this Chapter. (Prior code 17.03.560) 
Sec. 16-3-670. - Maintenance of open space areas, recreational areas, walkways or private streets. 
(a)  It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to provide an acceptable program for the continuing maintenance of open space and recreational areas with a PUD. Such provisions shall comply with the Colorado Common Interest Ownership Act, which is contained in Article 33.3, Title 38, C.R.S. The property owner shall provide the City with copies of the declaration which creates the common interest community, or a draft outline thereof. The declaration shall become effective prior to the final approval of the PUD. At a minimum, the common interest community shall define the responsibility for continuing maintenance of open space areas including, but not limited to the following: 
(1)  The landowners within the PUD may provide for and establish a corporation, duly incorporated in accordance with the laws of the State, for the ownership and maintenance of all common open space areas, walkways, recreational areas and private streets within the development. 
(2)  The landowners shall be jointly responsible for the maintenance of the open space areas, recreational areas, walkways or private streets. 
(3)  An open space and recreational agreement may be drafted which provide assurances that all such areas will be accessible to all residents of a residential PUD and that the areas will be maintained by the existing or future property owners. The form of the agreements shall be subject to the approval of the City. 
(b)  All proposals for the maintenance of the common open space areas, walkways and private streets shall be subject to approval of the City Council. In the event that said open spaces are not properly maintained, the City may file a lien against properties within the PUD to pay for maintenance costs per state statutes. (Prior code 17.03.580; Ord. 4 §1, 2005; Ord. 36 §2, 2007) 
Sec. 16-3-680. - Conflicts with other provisions of code. 
    Where there are conflicts between the provisions of this Article and other provisions of this Code, the provisions of this Article shall control. (Prior code 17.03.599; Ord. 36 §2, 2007) 
Division 7 - Adult Entertainment Uses and Establishments 

Sec. 16-3-810. - Purpose. 
    The purpose and intent of this Article is to regulate sexually oriented businesses, to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the City, thereby helping to reduce and eliminate the adverse secondary effects from such sexually oriented businesses. The provisions of this Article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this Article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment or the Colorado Constitution, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market; neither is it the intent or effect of this Article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. (Prior code 17.03.600) 
Sec. 16-3-820. - Location of establishment. 
(a)  No adult entertainment establishment shall be located within five hundred (500) feet of the exterior boundary of any residential zone district, church, public or private school, child care center, public community center, park, fairground, recreation center, alcoholic beverage establishment located in the City at which alcoholic beverages are offered for sale for consumption on the premises, or area designated as an urban renewal project area pursuant to Section 31-25-107, C.R.S. Further, no adult entertainment use shall be located within two hundred (200) feet of any arterial or major collector roadways. 
(b)  No adult entertainment use shall be located within one thousand (1,000) feet of any other adult entertainment use, whether such adult entertainment use is within or without the City. 
(c)  The method of measurement for the one-thousand-foot restriction shall be computed by direct measurement from the exterior boundary of any area identified in Subsection (a) above, or from the nearest property line of the property upon which an adult entertainment business or establishment or other adult entertainment use is conducted, to the nearest property line of the property whereon the building in which an adult entertainment use is to occur. (Prior code 17.03.600; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-3-830. - Nonconforming use. 
(a)  Any adult entertainment establishment operating at the effective date of the initial ordinance codified herein in violation of any relevant provision of Chapter 6 or 18 of this Code shall be deemed a nonconforming use. An adult entertainment establishment which is deemed a nonconforming use shall be permitted to continue operating for an amortization period of six (6) months. Such nonconforming adult entertainment use shall not be increased, enlarged, extended or altered, except that the use may be changed to a conforming use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adult entertainment establishment deemed a nonconforming use shall apply for a license provided for by Chapter 6, Article III of this Code within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the ordinance codified herein, or be subject to the relevant penalty provisions set forth herein and in Chapter 6, Article III. 
(b)  An adult entertainment establishment lawfully operating as a conforming use pursuant to the receipt of zoning approval and obtaining a license is not rendered a nonconforming use by the location, subsequent to the grant or renewal of an adult entertainment establishment license, of any uses identified in Section 16-3-820(a) above, within the specific distance requirements noted therein. (Prior code 17.03.600; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-3-840. - Business regulations. 
(a)  No licensee, manager or employee mingling with the patrons of a sexually oriented business or serving food or drinks shall be nude or in a state of nudity. It is a defense to prosecution for a violation of this Section that an employee of a sexually oriented business exposed any specified anatomical area during the employee's bona fide use of a rest room, or during the employee's bona fide use of a dressing room which is accessible only to employees. Further, no licensee or employee shall encourage or knowingly permit any person on the premises to engage in specified sexual activities, which conduct involving specified sexual activities is unlawful and shall be subject to criminal penalties as set forth in Section 6-3-510 of this Code. 
(b)  Advertisements, displays or other promotional material depicting adult entertainment uses shall not be shown or exhibited to be visible to the public from pedestrian sidewalks or walkways, or from other public or semi-public areas. 
(c)  Only one (1) adult entertainment establishment use shall be permitted per building; or, in other words, no building, premises, structure or other facility that contains any sexually oriented business shall contain any other kind of sexually oriented business therein. 
(d)  All building openings, entries and windows shall be located, covered or screened in such a manner as to prevent a viewing to the interior from any public or semi-public area; for new construction, the building shall also be oriented so as to minimize any possibility of viewing the interior from public or semi-public areas. (Prior code 17.03.600; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-3-850. - Age limitations. 
    No one under twenty-one (21) years of age shall be admitted to any adult entertainment establishment where live nude entertainment and performances are featured, which live nude entertainment is characterized by the exposure of specified anatomical areas. Further, no one under eighteen (18) years of age shall be admitted to any adult entertainment establishment of any kind. The foregoing minimum age limitations also apply to any employees, agents, servants or independent contractors working on the premises during the hours when adult entertainment is being presented. (Prior code 17.03.600) 
Sec. 16-3-860. - Hours of operation. 
    It shall be unlawful for an adult entertainment establishment and/or a sexually oriented business to be open for business, or for the licensee or any employee of a licensee to allow patrons upon licensed premises or to permit any employee to engage in a performance, solicit a performance, make a sale, solicit a sale, provide a service or solicit a service, between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. of any particular day. Further, it shall be unlawful and a person commits a misdemeanor if, working as an employee of a sexually oriented business, regardless of whether a license has been issued for said business under this Code, engages in a performance, solicits a performance, makes a sale, solicits a sale, provides a service or solicits a service between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. of any particular day. (Prior code 17.03.600) 
Sec. 16-3-870. - Unlawful acts. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for an adult entertainment establishment and/or a sexually oriented business or for the licensee or any employee of a licensee thereto, regardless of whether a license has been issued for said business under this Code, to knowingly allow any patron upon the premises to engage in a specified sexual activity while on said premises. It shall also be unlawful for any licensee or employee of an adult entertainment establishment, regardless of whether a license has been issued for said business under this Code, to engage in a specified sexual activity while on the premises of said adult entertainment establishment. The foregoing conditions contained in this Subsection are promulgated pursuant to the terms of this Code contained in this Division, this Code and Sections 18-7-208 and 18-7-301, C.R.S. 
(b)  This Division shall not apply to those areas of an adult motel that are private rooms. (Prior code 17.03.600) 
Sec. 16-3-880. - Violations; penalties. 
(a)  Any person or entity who operates or causes to be operated an adult entertainment establishment who violates any provision contained in this Division or does not have a valid license is subject to a suit for injunction and is subject to civil and criminal penalties as set forth in Sections 6-3-490 and 6-3-510 of this Code. 
(b)  Except for the amortization period set forth in Section 16-3-830 above, each day of operation in violation of any provision of this Division shall constitute a separate offense. 
(c)  Any adult entertainment establishment which engages in repeated or continuing violations of these regulations shall constitute a public nuisance. For purposes of these regulations, repeated violations shall mean three (3) or more violations of any provision set forth herein within one (1) year dating from the time of a new violation, and a continuing violation shall mean a violation of any provision set forth herein lasting for three (3) or more consecutive days. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other remedies at law or equity, the City Attorney may bring an action in the District Court for the County for an injunction against the operation of such establishments in a manner which violates any of the provisions set forth herein. (Prior code 17.03.600) 
ARTICLE IV - Subdivisions 
Division 1 - General Provisions 

Sec. 16-4-10. - Types of subdivisions. 
(a)  For purposes of these regulations, the term subdivision applies to any division of land into two (2) or more separate parcels, lots, sites, tracts, separate interests or interests in common, including any parcel of land which is to be used for condominiums or any other multiple-dwelling units with separately conveyed interests, but excepting any division of land which results from a conveyance or other transfer of land to the City, which conveyance is accepted by the City. All subdivisions of land located within the City are regulated by the provisions of this Chapter. 
(b)  Major subdivisions are subdivisions that result in the creation of more than four (4) parcels, lots, sites, tracts or interests out of the property as it existed prior to any subdivision. 
(c)  The division of lots or parcels of previously subdivided land is a resubdivision. Resubdivisions are reviewed as major subdivisions. 
(d)  The division of previously unsubdivided land into four (4) or fewer separate parcels, lots, sites, tracts or interests is a minor subdivision. 
(e)  The creation or abolition of condominium units or of a planned community as defined in Section 38-33.3-103(22), C.R.S., constitutes the creation of separate interests and is considered a subdivision action. 
(f)  The correction of technical errors, the adjustment of two (2) or more lot lines and the dissolution of two (2) or more lot lines on subdivision plats is accomplished by the preparation and processing of an amended plat, provided that the corrections, lot line adjustments or lot line dissolutions do not affect more than twenty (20) lots in the subdivision, and provided further that the subdivision improvements agreement is in full force and effect and is not affected by the amended plat. Such actions affecting more than twenty (20) lots or affecting the subdivision improvements agreement, or in a subdivision with an expired subdivision improvements agreement, shall be reviewed as resubdivisions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, a single lot line between two (2) conforming lots may be relocated or eliminated through the preparation and processing of a lot line adjustment/dissolution application which conforms to the requirements of Sections 16-4-60 and 16-5-140 of this Chapter. With the approval of the Planning Commission, more than a single lot line may be relocated or eliminated through the preparation and processing of a lot line adjustment/dissolution application which conforms to the requirements of Sections 16-4-60 and 16-5-140. (Prior code 17.04.110) 
Sec. 16-4-20. - Major subdivisions. 
(a)  The design and development of major subdivisions shall conform in every respect to the criteria and procedures of this Chapter, the requirements of the Public Works Manual and any other applicable requirements of the City. Major subdivisions will be reviewed in accordance with Article V of this Chapter. The review process for major subdivisions consists of separate reviews of sketch, preliminary and final plans which are reviewed sequentially; that is, the application for a preliminary plan may be submitted only upon completion of the sketch plan review process, and final plans are reviewed after the completion of the preliminary plan review process. Sketch and preliminary plans are reviewed by the Planning Commission although the decision of the Planning Commission may be appealed to the City Council. Final plans are typically reviewed only by the City Council, although the Planning Commission may, as a condition of approval of a preliminary plan, require that the final plan be submitted to the Planning Commission for review. Prior to submitting any application for approval of a major subdivision, the applicant shall meet with the Planning Department staff for a preapplication conference per Section 16-5-120 of this Chapter. 
(b)  The purpose of the major subdivision review is to evaluate the design of the proposed subdivision and to ensure that future residents or occupants of the subdivided property can be safely, efficiently and adequately served by public facilities, services and utilities and that the residential and nonresidential land uses conform to all land use regulations of the City. The major subdivision review process does not establish types of land uses which are determined by the zoning regulations of this Chapter. (Prior code 17.04.120; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-4-30. - Minor subdivisions. 
(a)  The design and development of minor subdivisions shall conform in every respect to the criteria and procedures of this Chapter, the requirements of the Public Works Manual and any other applicable requirements of the City. Minor subdivisions will be reviewed in accordance with Article V of this Chapter. 
(b)  The purpose of the minor subdivision review is to evaluate the design of the proposed subdivision and to ensure that future residents or occupants of the subdivided property can be safely, efficiently and adequately served by public facilities, services and utilities and that the residential and nonresidential land uses conform to all land use regulations of the City. The minor subdivision review process does not establish types of land uses which are determined by the zoning regulations. (Prior code 17.04.130; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-4-40. - Resubdivisions. 
    Resubdivisions are reviewed in the same manner as a major subdivision with the same purposes. To the extent that submittal information, otherwise required in Article VI of this Chapter, was submitted as part of the original subdivision proposal and is adequate by current standards, the applicant for approval of a resubdivision does not need to submit the information again and may reference such submittal information in the resubdivision application. The Planning Director or his or her designee and the Public Works Director or his or her designee will determine the technical adequacy of previously submitted information. (Prior code 17.04.140; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-4-50. - Amended plats. 
(a)  Amended plats do not create additional lots or interests in property but are subdivision actions to the extent that lot lines may be adjusted or relocated by the amended plat process or more than one (1) lot combined for building purposes. Amended plats are also used to correct errors on a subdivision plat. The amended plat process is limited to amendments that affect less than twenty (20) lots within a subdivision. Amendments affecting more than twenty (20) lots or amendments within a subdivision with an expired subdivision improvements agreement or which affect existing subdivision improvements agreements shall be considered resubdivisions. Amended plats are reviewed by the Public Works Director, Planning Department staff and appropriate review agencies prior to approval or denial of the amended plat by the Public Works Department, Planning and Development Department and appropriate review agencies prior to approval or denial of the amended plat by the Planning Director pursuant to the requirements of Section 16-5-130 of this Chapter. 
(b)  The first purpose of the amended plat review is to ensure the technical accuracy of the amended plat. The second purpose of the amended plat review is to maintain the record of associated real estate activities. (Prior code 17.04.150; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-4-60. - Single lot line adjustment or dissolution. 
    The lot line adjustment/dissolution application process is limited to the relocation or elimination of a single lot line between two (2) conforming lots. These applications are reviewed by the Public Works Department, Planning and Development Department and appropriate review agencies prior to approval or denial of the amended plat by the Planning Director pursuant to the requirements of Section 16-5-140 of this Chapter. (Prior code 17.04.160; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Division 2 - Miscellaneous Subdivision Provisions 

Sec. 16-4-110. - Land dedication and fees in lieu of dedication. 
    As further specified in Section 16-1-90 of this Chapter, for every subdivision the City Council shall require the dedication of certain sites for park and recreation use, and may require reservation of sites for school and other public purposes. Land dedications may include the one-hundred-year floodplain, national and state historic or natural features, and proposed public areas set aside in state, regional, county or City comprehensive plans.

Sec. 16-4-150. - Subdivisions and planned unit developments. 
(a)  A PUD is an overlay of the existing zone district that adds to and modifies the existing zoning regulations. PUDs are intended to allow more creativity in the development of land. PUD zoning and subdivision elements are unified in a PUD development plan. The review process for a PUD development plan entails the concurrent review of subdivision preliminary and final plans and, to that extent, the review process addresses both zoning and subdivision aspects simultaneously. 
(b)  The Planning Commission may recommend approval of a subdivision which departs from the usual design or regularly platted lots and blocks as a part of a PUD in accordance with the provisions of this Code. (Prior code 17.04.230; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-4-160. - Mobile home subdivision. 
    A subdivision may be designated as a mobile home subdivision upon approval of a conditional use application.

Sec. 16-4-170. - Subdivision improvements agreement. 
    A developer will be required to provide a subdivision improvements agreement acceptable to the City which addresses specific issues of the development, including but not limited to start of development, phasing of development, date of completion, infrastructure construction, common interest community, security for completion, expiration dates, one-year secured warranty, land dedication and landscaping. A sample of this agreement is available at the Planning Department. (Prior code 17.04.240) 
Sec. 16-4-180. - Avigation easement. 
    If the proposed subdivision lies partially or completely within the area in which an avigation easement is required pursuant to Ordinance No. 26, 1999, the Developer shall be required to execute and record the appropriate avigation easement prior to final plat recordation. A sample copy of the avigation easements, along with a map depicting where they are required, is available for review at the Planning Department. (Prior code 17.04.245) 
Division 3 - Modification or Vacation of Previously Approved Subdivisions 

Sec. 16-4-210. - Legislative declaration. 
    The City Council finds and determines that many subdivisions within the City, which have been previously approved or were approved by the County before being annexed into the City, have not been developed, and some such subdivisions were recorded prior to the current subdivision regulations, master plans, zoning regulations, building codes, state and local health regulations, designated matters of state interest and other applicable laws and regulations. The public health, safety and welfare require the City to periodically review such abandoned or uncompleted subdivisions, and it is the purpose of this Division to provide a mechanism for the review of undeveloped or nonconforming subdivisions to bring such subdivisions, or any parts thereof, into compliance with current regulations and provisions of law; and if such modifications are not feasible, to vacate undeveloped and nonconforming subdivisions, or any part thereof, to prohibit sales of lots therein, and to vacate lands within the subdivision which were dedicated to the public use. (Prior code 17.04.310) 
Sec. 16-4-220. - Definition. 
    As used in this Article, unless the context otherwise requires, subdivision is defined in Section 31-23-201(2), C.R.S. (Prior code 17.04.320) 
Sec. 16-4-230. - Review of subdivisions. 
    The Planning Commission, at the request of the City Manager, upon its own motion, or at the direction of the City Council, may initiate review of any subdivision within the City. This review will follow the procedures set forth in this Article, and shall be for the purpose of determining whether or not the subdivision is undeveloped or abandoned or no longer complies with regulations. (Prior code 17.04.330) 
Sec. 16-4-240. - Undeveloped or abandoned subdivisions. 
    For the purposes of this Article, lands described in the plat of any subdivision, or any part thereof, under review shall be considered to be undeveloped or abandoned if any one (1) or more of the following conditions are found by the Planning Commission to exist on such lands: 
(1)  The time limit for the completion of public improvements or subdivision approval as contained in any subdivision improvements agreement, amendment thereof or extension thereto, has expired or lapsed. 
(2)  Roadways which were intended to provide access into and travel within the subdivision have not been or are not being constructed to meet specifications at the time of the review. 
(3)  Facilities for the supply of domestic or industrial water to lots created by the subdivision have not been or are not being constructed or permits therefor have not been issued for installation on the lands. 
(4)  Sanitary sewerage and, if required, storm drainage facilities, or other public improvements required by the subdivision improvements agreement, have not been or are not being constructed. 
(5)  Buildings have not been or are not being constructed within the subdivision, and no permits have been issued for the construction of buildings upon the lands. 
(6)  No substantial amounts of money have been spent by the developer or others within three (3) years prior to the review in reliance upon the approval of the subdivision. 
(7)  No vested rights have accrued to the subdivision under the provisions of Chapter Article XI of this Chapter, or such vested rights have expired. 
(8)  The subdivision contains partially completed public improvements which, in their unfinished state, constitute a hazard or danger to the members of the public. 
(9)  No individual lots or parcels have been sold within the subdivision. (Prior code 17.04.340) 
Sec. 16-4-250. - Hearing to determine status. 
    If the Planning Commission makes an initial determination that a subdivision, or any part thereof, is undeveloped, abandoned or nonconforming, the Planning Commission shall hold a hearing to determine whether or not the subdivision, or any part thereof, should be modified, re-platted or vacated, or all or part of the lands within the subdivision dedicated to public use should be vacated. Notice of the hearing shall be given as required in Section 16-1-50 of this Chapter; in addition, notice shall be given to the holders of any security interest, mortgage, deed of trust or lien of record against the property. The City shall also attempt to give notice to any utility or other entity using rights-of-way or easements which appear on the plat of the subdivision. A copy of the public notice shall also be recorded with the County Clerk and Recorder. The failure to give adequate notice of the hearing shall not be grounds to invalidate any Planning Commission action under the provisions of this Chapter. (Prior code 17.04.350) 
Sec. 16-4-260. - Modification or vacation of subdivision plats. 
(a)  At the time of the hearing conducted pursuant to Section 16-4-250 above, the Planning Commission shall hear evidence and testimony from any interested person regarding the status of the subdivision and, if the Planning Commission determines the subdivision is undeveloped, abandoned or nonconforming, shall determine the most appropriate means to bring the subdivision into compliance with law. 
(b)  If the Planning Commission determines, following the hearing, that a subdivision, or any part of a subdivision, cannot be modified in accordance with the subdivision regulations, master plans, ordinances, codes and other state and local regulations, it may recommend that the subdivision be vacated. 
(c)  The findings and conclusions of the Planning Commission shall be transmitted in written form to the City Council, which shall consider the matter at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
(d)  Any action taken by the City Council to carry out the provisions of this Article shall be by ordinance. In the event the subdivision is a planned unit development and the plan must be released, removed or modified, the ordinance shall contain the findings of fact required by Section 24-67-106(3), C.R.S. 
(e)  The vacation of any subdivision, or any part thereof, and of all or any part of the lands within the subdivision dedicated for public use, shall be conducted according to the applicable law and this Article. In no event shall the City Council vacate any easement, right-of-way or roadway if doing so would jeopardize the rights of the public or any public utility. The vacation of lands dedicated for park land purposes, which have not been used for such purposes since subdivision approval, shall not be considered a sale or conveyance as defined in Section 13.2 of the Charter. 
(f)  If the ordinance vacates the subdivision approval, a certified copy of the ordinance shall be filed and recorded by the City Clerk with the same offices as required for subdivision approval, including the County Clerk and Recorder. 
(g)  The adoption and recording of an ordinance vacating a subdivision or any part thereof shall operate to nullify the force and effect of the recording of the subdivision plat, and no lots, blocks or parcels within the vacated subdivision may thereafter be sold or conveyed. 
(h)  The modification or vacation of a subdivision shall not affect title to the land within the vacated portion, except for title to lands dedicated to the City according to the original subdivision plat, which property shall vest according to the provisions of Section 43-2-302, C.R.S., and the terms of the ordinance vacating the subdivision. 
(i)  Nothing contained within this Article shall prohibit the voluntary application by the owner of an interest in lands within an undeveloped, abandoned or nonconforming subdivision to seek voluntary vacation of all or part of said subdivision. In the event a petition to vacate a subdivision is presented to the Planning Commission, signed by the owners of record of the property and the holders of all valid security interest, the additional notice requirements set forth in this Article shall not apply. 
(j)  If all or any part of a subdivision is vacated as provided herein, the Planning Commission shall then consider whether the zone district or districts shall be modified accordingly, in the manner provided by law. 
(k)  If all or any part of the subdivision is vacated as provided herein, the Planning Commission shall also consider what effect shall be given any cash paid by the original developer in lieu of land dedication, water rights dedication or any other fees required at the time of original subdivision approval. In the event the Planning Commission finds it would be appropriate to allow these fees to remain as a credit against the real property, the Planning Commission shall so state in its recommendation to the City Council. In no event, however, shall any such cash or other consideration paid remain a credit for a period of greater than twenty (20) years from the date of original subdivision approval. 
(l)  If all or any part of the subdivision is vacated or modified as provided herein, the Planning Commission shall also recommend to the City Council as to the disposition of any security given for the completion of public improvements, including any mortgages on the subject property, and shall recommend as to what action should be taken with respect to the subdivision improvements agreement and whether it should be released as against all of the property, a portion of the property or only that portion of the property which has been successfully developed. (Prior code 17.04.360) 
ARTICLE V - Review Procedures 
Division 1 - General Provisions 

Sec. 16-5-10. - Compliance. 
    Any land use activity, as defined in this Chapter, and located within the City, shall be subject to the provisions of these regulations and any other applicable regulations of the City. Any property owner desiring to establish a land use requiring approval of the City must obtain such approval prior to the establishment of the land use. Property owners are required to comply with all provisions of these regulations. (Prior code 17.05.110) 
Sec. 16-5-20. - General procedures and purpose. 
(a)  There are four (4) types of reviews of land use applications. Not every review process is utilized for every application. The first level of review is the staff review which is undertaken for every application. The staff review is the only review required for amended subdivision plats which do not create new lots. The second type of review is the Planning Commission review which encompasses applications for rezoning, conditional uses, subdivisions, planned unit developments and text amendments. The third category of review is the City Council review. The City Council reviews rezoning and text amendment applications as well as appeals of Planning Commission decisions. The fourth classification of review is the Board of Adjustment review. The Board of Adjustment reviews applications for zoning variances and interpretation of the land use regulations. The duties of the Board of Adjustment are hereby transferred to the Planning Commission. 
(b)  The purpose of this Article is to prescribe the procedures for the review of land use applications by the City staff, the Planning Commission, the City Council and the Board of Adjustment. (Prior code 17.05.120) 
Sec. 16-5-30. - Submittal of applications. 
    Except as otherwise specified in other sections of these regulations, any owner of real property located within the City may apply for the various land uses regulated by this Chapter as such land use applications affect the property owned by the applicant. A representative of the property owner who presents applications must also present written authorization from the property owner indicating that the applicant is authorized to represent the property owner. The Planning Commission or City Council may also initiate applications for amendments to the zoning map (rezoning) or amendments to the text of these regulations. (Prior code 17.05.130; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-5-40. - Submittal of development applications. 
(a)  Any property owner desiring to establish a land use pursuant to this Chapter shall first submit a development application form, which shall contain: the name of the property owner, the name of the applicant if different, the legal description of the real property and a list of all land use reviews desired by the property owner as required by this Code, including but not limited to pre-annexation agreements, annexations, subdivisions (including minor and major subdivision sketch plans, subdivision preliminary plans, subdivision combined sketch/preliminary plans, minor and major subdivision final plans and condominiumizations), amended plats, planned unit developments (including preliminary PUD development plans, PUD site plans and final PUD development plans), site specific development plans/vested rights, site plans, conditional use permits, lot line adjustments or dissolutions, plat vacations, variances, zone text amendments, zoning, and rezoning, with the land uses desired by the property owner indicated. The property owner shall pay the amount set forth in Appendix A to this Code, upon submittal of the development application form. A development application shall be appurtenant to the property and shall be transferable with the property. 
(b)  Upon payment of the required fee, the completed development application form shall be deemed a development application as defined in this Chapter, which development application shall include all phases of the project and every subsequent stage of review required by this Code. A property owner who submitted a development application form shall have one (1) year from the date of submittal in which to commence the additional steps, or the initial step if applicable, for the land use reviews indicated on the development application form. 
(c)  Any applicant with a land use review application filed pursuant to this Chapter pending before the City as of August 23, 2000 shall be considered to have submitted a development application, as defined in this Chapter, which development application shall include all phases of the project and every subsequent stage of review required by this Code. 
(d)  Sketch plan, preliminary plan and final plan are steps or phases in the subdivision process. A valid development application, as defined herein, for any of these steps or phases shall be construed as a valid development application for all subsequent phases for the entire subdivision process through its conclusion to final plan approval. The subdivision process is also an integral part of the PUD process (See Sections 16-6-190 and 16-6-200 of this Chapter). Therefore, a valid development application for planned unit development shall also be considered a valid development application for purposes of all steps and phases of the subdivision process for the property within such PUD. 
(e)  Nothing in this Section shall be construed as creating any entitlement to the approval of a particular land use review application, and all such applications shall be processed and reviewed to all relevant provisions of this Code and shall be subject to approval or denial by the City without regard to this Section, which approval or denial shall be based solely on the provisions of this Code. (Prior code 17.05.140; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-5-50. - Applications of public utilities for major public facilities. 
(a)  The purpose of this Section is to provide procedures necessary to implement the provisions of Section 29-20-108, C.R.S., which purports to require local government action on applications of public utilities for major public facilities within ninety (90) days after submission of a land use application if no preliminary approval is required, or within one hundred twenty (120) days if preliminary approval is required. By the passage of the initial ordinance codified herein, the City Council intends only to provide the procedures necessary to implement the provisions of that legislation. The City Council finds and determines that land use and development is a matter of particularly local concern, and the findings to the contrary contained in Section 29-20-108, C.R.S., are in error and entitled to no weight or consideration. Nothing contained in this Section shall constitute an admission by the City that the Colorado Legislature acted within the scope of its constitutional authority in the passage of the above-referenced legislation, nor shall it be construed as an admission that this legislation applies to a home rule municipality. 
(b)  The City shall take final action approving, with or without modification, or denying the application of a public utility providing electric or natural gas service that relates to the location, construction or improvement of major electrical or natural gas facilities, as defined in Section 29-20-108(3), C.R.S., within ninety (90) days after submission of a land use application if no preliminary approval is required, or within one hundred twenty (120) days if preliminary approval is required. Public hearings, public meetings and staff reviews shall be scheduled accordingly. Special meetings shall be convened if necessary to comply with this provision. The applicant may agree to waive the time limits set forth in this Section. (Prior code 17.05.150) 
Division 2 - City Staff Review

(Prior code 17.05.210) 
Sec. 16-5-120. - Preapplication conference. 
    Applicants for all land use applications are required to meet with the Planning Department staff to review the proposed development or rezoning prior to submittal of an application. The purpose of the preapplication conference is to familiarize the applicant with the City's requirements, procedures, policies and Comprehensive Plan before substantial commitments of time and money are made in the preparation of plans, surveys, engineering reports or other studies. The applicant is responsible for scheduling the preapplication conference with the Planning staff. An applicant for land use activities other than major subdivisions, PUDs or rezoning may also schedule a preapplication conference if the applicant wishes to discuss City requirements and policies prior to submittal of an application. The Planning Department staff has the discretion to waive the preapplication conference. (Prior code 17.05.220; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-5-130. - Amended or corrected subdivision plats.

The applicant shall also submit electronic drawings compatible with the City's GIS system prior to approval of the application. The drawings shall be tied to the current City GIS coordinate system, which has been established in UTM Zone 13. The files may be submitted via e-mail, 31/2" floppy diskette, FTP or ZIP disk. The file must be submitted in one (1) of the following formats: compatible CAD drawing (DWG or DXF), compatible shape file, or compatible ESRI file format (e00 or PC ArcInfo coverage). 
(c)  The Planning Department staff will determine if the application is complete. Incomplete applications will not be accepted for review. If the application is complete, the Planning Department staff will refer the application to relevant City departments, as well as utility companies serving the property.

Input from neighbors will be heavily considered by the Board of Adjustment. 
(3)  Cost or inconvenience to the applicant of strict or literal compliance with a regulation shall not be a reason for granting a variance, nor will special privileges be granted. In granting a variance, the Board of Adjustment may impose conditions deemed necessary to protect affected property owners and to protect the intent of this Chapter. 
(4)  The Board of Adjustment may grant a variance based on the following: 
a.  Either of the following criteria exists: 
1.  Minor additions or structural or cosmetic changes to existing structures, the result of which will be in harmony with the land use and existing structures in the neighborhood; or 
2.  A practical difficulty has been demonstrated, based on: 
a)  Size, shape or dimensions of a site; 
b)  Location of existing structures; 
c)  Topographic or physical conditions on the site or in the immediate vicinity; or 
d)  Other physical limitations such as street locations or traffic conditions in the immediate vicinity. 
b.  Such relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of the Comprehensive Plan or this Chapter. 
c.  The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare. 
d.  The proposed variance will not adversely affect adjacent properties or the surrounding neighborhoods. 
e.  Compatibility with adjacent land development and land uses is assured. 
(5)  In granting a variance, the Board of Adjustment may impose conditions deemed necessary to protect affected property owners and to protect the intent of this Chapter. (Prior code 17.05.550; Ord. 4 §1, 2005)

(Ord. 11 §2, 2004) 
Sec. 16-7-40. - Off-Street Parking Schedule "C". 
    Schedule "C" uses have widely varying parking and loading demand characteristics, making it difficult to specify a single parking or loading standard. Upon receiving a development application for a use subject to "Schedule C" standards, the Planning and Development Director shall apply the off-street parking and loading standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or establish a minimum off-street parking requirement on the basis of a parking and loading study prepared by the applicant. The study must include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) or other acceptable estimates as approved by the Planning Director, and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity and location. The study must document the source of data used to develop the recommendations. (Ord. 11 §2, 2004) 
Sec. 16-7-50. - Off-street loading schedule.

Type B: Twelve-foot minimum width, thirty-five-foot minimum length and fourteen-foot minimum vertical clearance. 
(Ord. 11 §2, 2004) 
Sec. 16-7-60. - Rules for computing requirements. 
    The following rules apply when computing off-street parking requirements. 
(1)  Combination of uses. Unless otherwise approved, lots containing more than one (1) use must provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses. 
(2)  Fractions. When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any fraction of one-half (.5) or less shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number and any fraction greater than one-half (.5) shall be rounded to the next highest whole number. 
(3)  Area measurements. Unless otherwise specified, all square-footage-based parking and loading standards must be computed on the basis of gross floor area. 
(4)  Occupancy- or capacity-based standards. For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on employees, students, residents or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift, the maximum enrollment or the maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever is applicable and whichever results in the greater number of spaces. 
(5)  Unlisted uses. Upon receiving a development application for a use not specifically listed in an off-street parking schedule, the Planning and Development Director shall apply the off-street parking standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or establish a minimum off-street parking requirement based on the requirements that apply to Schedule "C" uses. (Ord. 11 §2, 2004) 
Sec. 16-7-70. - Location. 
    Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article, required off-street parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the principal use (See Off-Street Parking Alternatives, Section 16-7-90 below). (Ord. 11 §2, 2004) 
Sec. 16-7-80. - Setbacks. 
(a)  In a commercial or industrial zone district, required off-street parking spaces may occupy any part of the property, except within required landscape areas or site distance triangles. 
(b)  Off-street parking or storage of vehicles, travel trailers or motor homes shall not be permitted within any front or street side setback area, provided that off-street parking may be permitted within that portion of any setback used for driveway access to required off-street parking areas for single-family residences and duplex units. Storage of mobile homes is not permitted unless related to an approved mobile home sale facility. (Ord. 11 §2, 2004) 
Sec. 16-7-90. - Off-street parking alternatives. 
    The Planning Director shall be authorized to approve alternatives to providing the number of off-street parking spaces required by Schedule "A" in accordance with this Section. 
(1)  Off-site parking. The Planning Director may approve the location of required off-street parking spaces on a separate lot from which the principal use is located if the off-street parking complies with all of the following: 
a.  Ineligible activities. Off-site parking may not be used to satisfy the off-street parking standards for residential uses (except guest parking), restaurants, convenience stores or other convenience-oriented uses. Required parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities may not be located off-site. 
b.  Location. No off-street parking space may be located more than six hundred (600) feet from the primary entrance of the use served (measured along the shortest legal pedestrian route) unless remote parking shuttle bus service is provided. Off-site parking spaces may not be separated from the use served by a street right-of-way with a width of more than one hundred (100) feet. Off-site parking spaces may not be separated from the use served unless there is an improved pedestrian path offering access or a shuttle bus serves the parking area. 
c.  Zoning classification. Off-site parking areas require the same or a more intensive zoning classification than required for the use served. 
d.  Off-site parking agreement. In the event that an off-site parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a written agreement between the record owners will be required. The agreement must guarantee the use of the off-site parking area for at least ten (10) years. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to the Planning Director for recordation in the form established by the City Attorney. Recordation of the agreement must take place before issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. An off-site parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided, in accordance with Schedule "A" (Section 16-7-20 above). No use shall be continued if the parking is removed unless substitute parking facilities are provided, and the Planning Director shall be notified at least sixty (60) days prior to the termination of a lease for off-site parking. 
(2)  Shared parking. The Planning Director may approve shared parking facilities for developments or uses with different operating hours or different peak business periods if the shared parking complies with the following: 
a.  Location. Shared parking spaces must be located within six hundred (600) feet of the primary entrance of all uses served, unless remote parking shuttle bus service is provided. 
b.  Zoning classification. Shared parking areas require the same or a more intensive zoning classification than required for the use served. 
c.  Shared parking study. Those wishing to use shared parking as a means of satisfying off-street parking requirements must submit to the Planning Director a shared parking analysis that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. It must address, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that will share off-street parking spaces. 
d.  Shared parking agreement. A shared parking plan will be enforced through written agreement among all owners of record. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to the Planning Director for recordation in a form approved by the City Attorney. Recordation of the agreement must take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. A shared parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces would be provided, in accordance with Schedule A.

(4)  In passing upon such applications, the Board of Adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors and standards specified in other sections of this Article, and: 
a.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
b.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
c.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
d.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
e.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
f.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
g.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
h.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
i.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
j.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and, 
k.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(5)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that items set forth above have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(6)  Upon consideration of these factors and the purposes of this Article, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Article. 
(7)  The Public Works Director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(b)  Conditions for variances. 
(1)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(2)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(4)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(5)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

(Ord. 7 §11, 2013) 
Sec. 16-12-240. - Standards for Critical Facilities. 
(a)  A Critical Facility is a structure or related infrastructure, but not the land on which it is situated, as specified in Rule 6 of the Rules and Regulations for Regulatory Floodplains in Colorado, that, if flooded, may result in significant hazards to public health and safety or interrupt essential services and operations for the community at any time before, during and after a flood. 
(1)  Critical Facilities are classified under the following categories: (i) essential services; (ii) hazardous materials; (iii) at-risk populations; and (iv) vital to restoring normal services. 
a.  Essential services facilities include public safety, emergency response, emergency medical, designated emergency shelters, communications, public utility plant facilities and transportation lifelines. These facilities consist of: 
1.  Public safety (police stations, fire and rescue stations, emergency vehicle and equipment storage and emergency operation centers); 
2.  Emergency medical (hospitals, ambulance service centers, urgent care centers having emergency treatment functions and non-ambulatory surgical structures, but excluding clinics, doctors offices and nonurgent care medical structures that do not provide these functions); 
3.  Designated emergency shelters; 
4.  Communications (main hubs for telephone, broadcasting equipment for cable systems, satellite dish systems, cellular systems, television, radio and other emergency warning systems, but excluding towers, poles, lines, cables and conduits); 
5.  Public utility plant facilities for generation and distribution (hubs, treatment plants, substations and pumping stations for water, power and gas, but not including towers, poles, power lines, buried pipelines, transmission lines, distribution lines and service lines); and 
6.  Air transportation lifelines (airports [municipal and larger], helicopter pads and structures serving emergency functions and associated infrastructure [aviation control towers, air traffic control centers and emergency equipment aircraft hangars]). 
Specific exemptions to this category include wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), nonpotable water treatment and distribution systems and hydroelectric power generating plants and related appurtenances. 
Public utility plant facilities may be exempted if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same utility or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract) and connected, the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with the provisions of this Article and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant systems will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the City on an as-needed basis upon request. 
b.  Hazardous materials facilities include facilities that produce or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials. These facilities may include: 
1.  Chemical and pharmaceutical plants (chemical plant, pharmaceutical manufacturing); 
2.  Laboratories containing highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials; 
3.  Refineries; 
4.  Hazardous waste storage and disposal sites; and 
5.  Aboveground gasoline or propane storage or sales centers. 
Facilities shall be determined to be Critical Facilities if they produce or store materials in excess of threshold limits. If the owner of a facility is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to keep a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) on file for any chemicals stored or used in the workplace, AND the chemical is stored in quantities equal to or greater than the Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ) for that chemical, then that facility shall be considered to be a critical facility. The TPQ for these chemicals is either five hundred (500) pounds or the TPQ listed (whichever is lower) for the three hundred fifty-six (356) chemicals listed under 40 C.F.R. § 302 (2010), also known as Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS); or ten thousand (10,000) pounds for any other chemical. This threshold is consistent with the requirements for reportable chemicals established by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. OSHA requirements for MSDS can be found in 29 C.F.R § 1910 (2010). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation "Designation, Reportable Quantities, and Notification," 40 C.F.R. § 302 (2010) and OSHA regulation "Occupational Safety and Health Standards," 29 C.F.R. § 1910 (2010) are incorporated herein by reference and include the regulations in existence at the time of the promulgation of this Article, but exclude later amendments to or editions of the regulations. 
1.  Finished consumer products within retail centers and households containing hazardous materials intended for household use and agricultural products intended for agricultural use. 
2.  Buildings and other structures containing hazardous materials for which it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local authority having jurisdiction by hazard assessment and certification by a qualified professional (as determined by the local jurisdiction having land use authority) that a release of the subject hazardous material does not pose a major threat to the public. 
3.  Pharmaceutical sales, use, storage and distribution centers that do not manufacture pharmaceutical products. Chemical and pharmaceutical plants (chemical plant, pharmaceutical manufacturing). 
These exemptions shall not apply to buildings or other structures that also function as Critical Facilities under another category outlined in this Article. 
c.  At-risk population facilities include medical care, congregate care and schools. These facilities may consist of: 
1.  Elder care (nursing homes); 
2.  Congregate care serving twelve (12) or more individuals (daycare and assisted living); 
3.  Public and private schools (preschools, K-12 schools), before-school and after-school care serving twelve (12) or more children. 
d.  Facilities vital to restoring normal services, including government operations. These facilities consist of: 
1.  Essential government operations (public records, courts, jails, building permitting and inspection services, community administration and management, maintenance and equipment centers); 
2.  Essential structures for public colleges and universities (dormitories, offices and classrooms only). 
These facilities may be exempted if it is demonstrated to the City that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same entity or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract), the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with this Article, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant facilities will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the City on an as-needed basis upon request. 
(2)  Protection of Critical Facilities. All new and substantially improved Critical Facilities and new additions to critical facilities located within the Special Flood Hazard Area shall be regulated to a higher standard than structures not determined to be Critical Facilities. For the purposes of this Article, protection shall include one (1) of the following: 
a.  Location outside the Special Flood Hazard Area; or 
b.  Elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, to at least two (2) feet above the Base Flood Elevation. 
(3)  Ingress and egress of new critical facilities. New Critical Facilities shall, when practicable as determined by the City, have continuous noninundated access (ingress and egress for evacuation and emergency services) during a 100-year flood event. (Ord. 7 §12, 2013)

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. 20 §2, adopted Jan. 7, 2015, repealed the former Art. XIII, §§ 16-13-10-16-13-170, and enacted a new Art. XIII as set out herein. The former article pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. 27 §1, 2004; Ord. 4 §1, 2005; Ord. 10 §§2, 3, 2011. 

Sec. 16-13-10. - General provisions. 
    Landscaping shall refer to any combination of living plants such as trees, shrubs, plants, vegetative ground cover and turf grasses, and may include natural nonliving elements such as rock, stone and bark, as well as structural features, including but not limited to walks, fences, benches, works of art, reflective pools and fountains. 
( Ord. 20 §2, 2014) 
Sec. 16-13-20. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose and intent of this Article is to protect the health and welfare of the citizens of Rifle through the regulation of landscaping of new multi-family, commercial, public/civic, light industrial and industrial developments. Installed landscapes should enhance property values, promote quality development, contribute to the visual character of new developments, and promote water conservation through xeriscaping. Xeriscape principles are as follows: 
(1)  Design. Identify zones of different water requirements and group plants together that have similar water needs; 
(2)  Appropriate Use of Turf. Limit high-irrigation turf and plantings to appropriate high-use areas with high visibility and functional needs; 
(3)  Low-Water-Using Plants. Choose low-water-demanding plants and turf where practicable; 
(4)  Irrigation. Design, operate and maintain an efficient irrigation system; 
(5)  Soil Preparation. Incorporate soil amendments before planting; 
(6)  Mulch. Add mulch to planting beds to a minimum depth of three (3) inches; 
(7)  Maintenance. Provide regular and attentive maintenance. 
( Ord. 20 §2, 2014) 
Sec. 16-13-30. - Scope and applicability. 
(a)  The provisions of this Article shall apply to all new construction of multi-family housing, commercial development, public/civic, light industrial and industrial development. 
(b)  Existing or nonconforming landscapes. Landscapes installed prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Article, and not in compliance herewith, shall be regarded as nonconforming landscapes that may continue as long as the landscapes are properly maintained in conformance with the other ordinances of the City. If uses or buildings regulated by this Article are reconstructed, remodeled or added to where the alteration will affect more than fifty percent (50%) of the building's gross floor area, or where more than fifty percent (50%) of the building's lot will be impacted, landscaping shall be updated to meet all applicable code requirements in effect at that time. 
( Ord. 20 §2, 2014) 
Sec. 16-13-40. - Definitions. 
    Whenever the following words or phrases are used in this Article, they shall have the following meanings: 
    Annual means a plant that lives only one (1) year or growing season. 
    Bunch grass means those types of grasses that grow in clumps and do not spread to form a continuous sod mat and do not require regular mowing, as do turf grasses. Included are most of the native or prairie grasses such as bluestems, fescues, grammas, wheat grasses, etc. 
    Coniferous means those evergreen plants whose foliage is needle-like, scale-like or awl-like and are cone-bearing. 
    Deciduous means a plant with foliage that is shed annually. 
    Evergreen means a plant with foliage that persists and is green year-round and may or may not be coniferous. 
    Groundcover means low-growing perennial and/or evergreen plants, other than turf grass, which grow and spread in such a manner as to provide continuous plant coverage. Such plants are typically shorter than eighteen (18) inches and may include herbs, ivies, ornamental grasses, perennials, spreading evergreens, succulents, vines and wildflowers. Annuals, mulches and stone are not considered groundcovers. 
    Hedge means a continuous, living, landscape barrier consisting of closely planted shrubs maintained at a height of greater than two (2) feet. Trees of any kind, other than upright junipers, shall not be pruned, sheared, trimmed or otherwise treated as hedges, but may be planted, as approved, to form wind-rows, visual screens or sound barriers. 
    Landscaping means aesthetic improvements using natural and manmade materials as defined below (landscaping materials). Landscaping areas may also include, by way of example but not by way of limitation, the following: basketball courts, pools, tennis courts, playgrounds or similar recreational areas or uses. 
    Landscaping materials means, but is not limited to, trees, shrubs, vines, and plants of all descriptions (excluding weeds and other unkempt vegetation) and other materials and treatments such as stone, mulches and other nonliving landscape materials. 
    Living plant material coverage means the covering of raw ground or bare soil with living landscape materials at a growth size of two-thirds (2/3) maturity, such as shrubs, groundcovers, perennials, vines and all plants of all descriptions (excluding weeds or other unkempt vegetation). Living plant material shall be distributed throughout the entire landscape treatment area so as to avoid over-massing of plant materials or creating disproportionately large areas containing no living plant material. 
    Mulch means nonliving matter, such as bark chips, chipped wood products, pole shavings, stone and any approved like materials customarily used in landscapes for the purpose of retaining soil moisture, retarding weed growth and stabilizing soils. 
    Nonliving landscaping materials means, but shall not be specifically limited to, manmade or artificial materials used for decorative or ornamental purposes such as fountains, monuments, statues, planting containers and trestles and frames; but excluding artificial plants, shrubs, bushes, trees and flowers. 
    Ornamental grass means those types of grasses that grow in clumps, and do not spread to form a continuous mat, as do turf grasses. Bunch grasses and other taller, more decorative types of grasses may be considered ornamental when grown as accents in conjunction with other plants in larger bed-plantings. 
    Ornamental tree means a tree, typically fifteen (15) to twenty (20) feet tall at maturity, that is planted for its decorative value, perhaps in screening applications rather than for shading purposes. They are usually deciduous but may include short growing conifers such as upright junipers, pinion pine and bristlecone pine. 
    Perennial means those types of herbaceous flowering plants which live for several years and "die back" annually to grow again the next season without having to be replaced or replanted. 
    Planting bed means any landscape area covered with a non-turf surface such as rocks, gravel, mulch, or like material, into which trees, shrubs, and ornamental grasses are planted. 
    Shade tree means a tree, over fifteen (15) to twenty (20) feet tall at maturity, that is deciduous and planted for its wider canopy, higher bottom branch scaffold and shading value and does not include conifers or evergreens of any kind. 
    Shrub means a long-lived deciduous, evergreen or coniferous woody plant, typically multi-stemmed and having a mature height of between three (3) and fifteen (15) feet, and does not include perennials. 
    Stone means any rock material that may fall under further sub-classification, such as river rock, cobble, flagstone, boulders and others. Any stone material used in landscape applications must be at least three-fourths (3/4) inch in diameter or cross-section. Squeegee and road-base are not acceptable materials within the definition of "stone." 
    Street tree means trees strategically planted, usually in parkway strips, medians or along streets, to enhance the visual quality of a street. 
    Tree means a long-lived deciduous, evergreen or coniferous woody plant, typically single-stemmed and having a mature height of fifteen (15) feet or more. 
    Turf grass means those types of grasses that do not grow in clumps but, rather, spread naturally to form a continuous sod mat. Such are the grasses customarily used in lawn applications, typically available in sod form, being tolerant of foot traffic, and presenting a finished, maintained appearance with proper care. 
    Weeds means plants included in the Garfield County Vegetation Management Program Noxious Weed List. 
    Xeriscape means water conservation through creative landscape design that reduces water consumption, landscape maintenance and the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Principles associated with xeriscaping include appropriate planning and design, soil improvements, efficient irrigation, practical turf areas, appropriate plant selection, uses of mulches and maintenance. 
( Ord. 20 §2, 2014) 
Sec. 16-13-50. - Submittal requirements.

(10)  Planting and installation details as necessary to ensure conformance with all required standards. 
(11)  Guarantee from the developer that all plant materials will be warranted for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the time of installation. If any of the material should fail to survive during that period, it will be replaced during the next appropriate planting season with materials similar in type and size to those outlined on the approved landscape plans. If a material fails because it is an inappropriate selection for the site where installed, such material shall be replaced with a more appropriate plant for that site and shall be of approximately the same size as the material specified on landscape plans for that location. 
( Ord. 20 §2, 2014) 
Sec. 16-13-60. - Certificate of occupancy. 
(a)  No final inspection shall be completed or certificate of occupancy (C.O.) issued, except as stated in Subsection (b) below, for any multi-family, commercial, public/civic, light industrial or industrial property that is required to provide landscaping in conformance with these regulations unless all landscaping on the property has been installed and has been accepted in writing as correct by the commercial nursery, licensed landscape contractor or landscape architect that developed the approved landscape plans for such property. 
(b)  Final inspections may be completed and C.O.s issued by the Director of Planning and Development prior to the installation or completion of the landscaping when weather conditions or other circumstances, such as the winter season, place an unreasonable burden or hardship on the developer or builder. Such burden or hardship must be documented in writing by a commercial nursery or licensed landscape contractor stating that it would be impractical or unwise to install landscape materials due to conditions such as those outlined above. All landscape improvements allowed under a delayed installment must be completed within one (1) year of the date of issuance of the C.O. Additional time may granted by the Director of Planning and Development when conditions or circumstances such as those previously described herein prevent completion. 
(c)  In those instances where a C.O. is granted prior to the installation of landscaping, the developer or builder shall be required to provide a surety, such as a cash escrow or letter of credit, for one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the estimated cost of materials and labor for the installation of the landscaping. The surety shall be in a form and amount approved by the Director of Planning and Development to guarantee that, by an agreed-upon date, the required landscaping is installed according to the approved landscape plan, or the surety will be subject to forfeiture to the City. The City then may apply the surety funds towards installation of landscaping on the subject property, or seek other enforcement remedies. 
(d)  In those instances where a C.O. is granted prior to the installation of landscaping, the developer or builder must meet all of the City's sediment and erosion control requirements by an agreed-upon date as established by the Department of Public Works. 
(e)  All landscaping material and labor estimates presented by developers in connection with the issuance of a C.O. prior to landscape installation shall be prepared by a commercial nursery, licensed landscape contractor or landscape architect, and such estimate shall be signed and dated by the person who prepared it. The Director of Planning and Development must approve the estimate before submittal of any surety.

Sec. 16-13-80. - General landscape requirements. 
(a)  Landscape treatment area. Commercial, industrial, civic, and multi-family uses shall have landscape treatment areas that include all areas of the site not covered by structures, bodies of water, driveways, sidewalks, plazas, hardscape recreation areas, parking lots, or ditches. 
(b)  Specific landscape treatment areas are further addressed in: 
(1)  Right-of-way landscaping (Sec. 16-13-90); 
(2)  Parking lot landscaping (Sec. 16-13-100). 

Typical components of a landscape treatment area.
(c)  All landscape treatment areas shall meet the following standards: 
(1)  Turf. A maximum of fifty percent (50%) of the total landscape treatment area may be covered with turf. Native grasses may be used as a non-turf alternative. If kept in a healthy and weed-free state native grasses may grow to a mature height of above eight (8) inches without being considered a weed. 
(2)  Planting beds . Any area of the site covered by rock, gravel, or mulch is defined as a planting bed. The following standards are intended to provide a diversity of landscape materials within planting beds. 
a.  Planting beds shall have a minimum of one (1) planting (tree, shrub, or ornamental grass) per twenty-five (25) square feet of planting bed area. 
b.  The maximum usage of any one (1) plant species is fifty percent (50%) of total plantings. 
c.  Ornamental grasses shall be no more than forty percent (40%) of the total number of plantings. 
d.  At least fifty percent (50%) of plantings shall meet low-water use (xeric) criteria. See Appendix C plant list. 
e.  River cobble as a planting bed ground cover shall not cover more than fifty percent (50%) of the total landscape treatment area, and is not permitted in street buffers for commercial zones, to preserve public safety. Pea gravel, organic mulch, or other similar materials are preferred alternatives. 
f.  At least ten percent (10%) of plants shall be of a flowering variety. Flowering plants should be used along right-of-ways or in foundation landscaping areas. See Appendix C plant list. 
(3)  Trees . See tree requirements for right-of-ways (Sec. 16-13-90) and parking lots (Sec. 16-13-100). 
a.  Trees in unspecified landscape areas. Landscape treatment areas not within defined right-of-way, parking lot, or foundation areas shall provide trees at a ratio of one (1) tree per four hundred (400) square feet. Exception: In areas away from public use and view, and where it is appropriate for the site to retain a natural character, the Planning Director may approve use of unirrigated native grasses in place of tree requirements. 
b.  Quaking aspen trees shall be permitted but shall not count towards required trees. 
(4)  Airport Road landscape buffer. The minimum landscape buffer along Airport Road shall be fifteen (15) feet in Commercial zones and twenty (20) feet in Light Industrial zones.

    Prior to the issuance of any building permit for construction of a structure within Knollridge Development Area No. 2, the applicant therefor shall demonstrate compliance with the following conditions: 
(1)  26th Street improvements. Lots 1, 4 and 5 border 26th Street and shall share in the cost of constructing that part of 26th Street extending from 24th Street to the western boundary of Knollridge Development Area No. 3, as hereinafter provided. 
a.  One-half (1/2) the cost of extending 26th Street to Development Area No. 3 shall be shared among Lots 1, 4 and 5. Such one-half share shall be further allocated among those lots on a front-foot basis. Each lot shall pay its allocable share at the time of building permit application for that lot as follows: 
1.  The share allocable to such lot shall be paid under the cost recovery method, if that portion of 26th Street extending to Development Area No. 3 has been constructed. 
2.  If 26th Street has not yet been constructed at the time of the building permit application, the lot shall prepay its share of the cost recovery obligation based upon the then-current cost of constructing 26th Street, as estimated by the Public Works Director. Such prepayment shall be held in an interest-bearing account and, for bookkeeping purposes, shall be separately accounted for by the City. 
b.  Payment pursuant to Subparagraph a.1 or 2 above shall satisfy that lot's obligation to contribute to the construction of 26th Street. 
c.  Once 26th Street, or parts thereof, are actually constructed, the City may distribute prepaid funds, together with interest attributable thereto, in the manner of a cost recovery to the parties who actually construct 26th Street. 
(2)  Parking and access. 
a.  The Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, Restrictions and Liens of Woodridge Townhomes Association (the "Woodridge Declaration") recorded in the Office of the Clerk and Recorder in Book 594 at Page 765 as Reception No. 325670, declares the parking lot a common facility and common element for the benefit of Lots 1-8. Lots 1-6 remain unimproved and, although submitted to the Woodridge Declaration, these lots have not yet been subdivided, platted or developed and shall therefore be required to comply with the Zoning Code (including density requirements) as in effect at the time of building permit application. 
b.  Lot 1 and Lot 5 shall each provide the City with a copy of a written agreement affording such lot, at a minimum, pedestrian access to the parking lot across one (1) or more of the other lots. If any lot proposes a plan that requires access off 26th Street, the building permit applicant for that lot shall be required by the City to complete the construction of 26th Street as necessary to serve such lot, subject to appropriate cost recovery arrangements. 
c.  The operation and maintenance of the parking lot is governed by the Woodridge Declaration, and the owners of any units developed on Lots 1-6 shall be members, along with the owners of the existing units on Lots 7 and 8, in a common association as contemplated and required by the Woodridge Declaration, unless otherwise agreed by all parties in interest, in which latter event, the provisions set forth in Paragraph (3) below shall apply. 
(3)  Association documents. The applicant shall demonstrate to the City that the multi-family structures to be constructed shall be part of and included within an existing homeowners' association, or shall submit for approval by the City new association documents to govern the multi-family structures to be constructed on any lot. Only one (1) association shall be permitted upon each lot; provided, however, that all associations must have entered into an agreement regarding the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of all common areas utilized jointly by the members of such associations, including but not limited to parking areas and parking lot access. 
(4)  Agreement regarding parking lot construction. At the time of the first building permit application for Lot 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, the building permit applicant shall enter into an agreement with the City guaranteeing the construction or improvement of the parking lot, subject to cost recovery from the other unimproved lots, in proportion to the number of units permitted on each lot under the then-existing zoning. All cost recovery charges shall be due and payable at the time of the first building permit application for each lot and the cost sharing formula shall remain in effect for a period of fifteen (15) years from the effective date of the initial ordinance codified herein. 
(5)  Timing of parking lot improvements. Performance of any obligations with respect to parking lot or parking lot access improvements shall be completed at or, if construction is guaranteed to the satisfaction of City staff, immediately following, construction of the units for which the building permit is authorized. 
(6)  Payment of fees. The applicant shall pay to the City at the time of issuance of any building permit the fees set forth in Section 16-15-160 below. 
(7)  Effect on existing structures. Nothing herein shall be deemed to impose any financial obligation on the owners of the existing units located within Development Area 2, commonly known as the Woodridge Townhomes, to construct parking lots or access drives; provided that such units shall reasonably participate in parking lot and access maintenance and repair as set forth in the recorded instruments affecting such units, or as otherwise agreed in writing by the affected lot owners. (Prior code 17.16.120; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-15-140. - Knollridge Development Area No. 3. 
    Prior to the issuance of any building permit for construction of a structure within Knollridge Development Area No. 3, the applicant therefor shall demonstrate compliance with the following conditions: 
(1)  The execution of a subdivision improvements agreement in the standard form then required by the City of developers, to secure the cost of the completion of 26th Street and Howard Avenue as adjacent and contiguous to Development Area No. 3 or the portion contiguous to the phase contemplated for development, and completion of all water and sewer transmission and distribution lines, all drainage improvements and all other utilities. After cost recovery, infrastructure and road costs shall be shared equally by the properties adjoining 26th Street and Howard Avenue. To the extent such facilities have been installed by the developer of Knollridge Development Area No. 4 or the Palomino Park PUD, Filing No. 4 (for Howard Avenue), such SIA shall be waived; provided, however, that the applicant for each building permit shall be required to pay cost recovery fees on a front-footage basis, due as set forth in Section 16-15-160 below. Prior to execution of the subdivision improvements agreement, the applicant shall submit plans and specifications for review and approval by the Public Works Director pursuant to this Code and the Public Works Manual. In the event it is not possible for the applicant to secure the execution of such subdivision improvements agreement by one hundred percent (100%) of the owners of undeveloped property within Development Area No. 3, the applicant nonetheless shall be entitled to secure building permits upon the execution of a subdivision improvements agreement by sixty percent (60%) of the property within Development Area No. 3. However, such subdivision improvements agreement shall then include provision for cost recovery to the applicant from the remaining undeveloped lots, which payments shall be due in full, in an amount to be determined pursuant to the subdivision improvements agreement, at the time of the first building permit issuance for each lot, on a per-lot basis. Such subdivision improvements agreement shall also include provisions for cost recovery from the developers of Development Area No. 4, or the developers of Palomino Park PUD, Filing No. 4 (for Howard Avenue), which fees shall be determined as part of the subdivision improvements agreement and due and payable pursuant to Section 16-15-160 below. 
(2)  Association documents. The applicant shall demonstrate to the City that the multi-family structures to be constructed shall be part of and included within an existing homeowners' association, or shall submit for approval by the City new association documents to govern the multi-family structures to be constructed on any lot. Only one (1) association shall be permitted upon each lot; provided, however, that all associations must entered into an agreement regarding the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of all common areas utilized by such property, including but not limited to parking areas and parking lot access. 
(3)  Street access and parking lots. The applicant shall provide the City with a copy of a written agreement granting such property owner, or other evidence that the property owner has, the right to utilize the proposed parking lot, which agreement shall also provide for the use, operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of said parking lot. Moreover, such agreement or evidence shall include the establishment of a reserve fund for the purpose of improving, by overlay or sealing, such parking lot. Access and parking within Development Area No. 1 shall be as follows: 
a.  Lots 2, 3, 4 and 9 access. Access to Lots 2, 3 and 4 within Development Area 3 shall only occur off of 24th Street. Access to Lot 9 shall only occur off of 26th Street. Further, Lots 2, 3, 4 and 9 must be provided with adequate on-site parking acceptable to the City consistent with this Code. 
b.  Parking lots within Development Area 3. At the time of the first building permit application for any lots located within Development Area 3, the building permit applicant shall construct one (1) of the two (2) unfinished parking lots located within Development Area 3 as approved by the City, subject to cost recovery on a pro rata basis from all other lots owners within Development Area 3. 
(4)  Agreement regarding parking lot construction. At the time of the issuance of the building permit, the applicant shall enter an agreement with the City providing for the construction of the parking lot required by Subsection (3) above, including any provision for cost recovery from other potential users of such parking lot and/or parking lot access. 
(5)  Payment of fees. The applicant shall pay to the City at the time of issuance of any building permit the fees set forth in Section 16-15-160 below. (Prior code 17.16.120; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-15-150. - Knollridge Development Area No. 4. 
    The City requires that Knollridge Development Area 4 must be replatted to conform to this Code. The Development Area 4 replat shall reflect no more than fifty (50) lots, and all lots shall comply with the current Code requirements, including but not limited to minimum lot size and setbacks. Further, 27th Street as presently platted shall be vacated and eliminated from its presently platted location. Concurrent with the replat of Development Area 4, additional public improvement specifications and requirements shall be included in the Knollridge Subdivision Improvements Agreement for Development Area 4. At the time of final approval of any replat for Development Area 4, or any phase thereof, the developer shall enter into a subdivision improvements agreement in the standard form then required by the City and shall pay the fees imposed by Section 16-15-160 below, as set forth therein. (Prior code 17.16.120; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-15-160. - Fees. 
    The applicant shall pay, at the time of the first issuance of a building permit for any multi-family unit, all fees due for all units to be constructed on the multi-family lot, or at the time of the issuance of the first single-family building permit within any phase, all fees due for all units within such phase. For this purpose, the following fees shall apply: 
(1)  Parkland dedication fees as set forth in Appendix A to this Code, or the cash in lieu of parkland dedication fees in effect at the time of the building application. 
(2)  Water right dedication cash-in-lieu fee as set forth in Appendix A to this Code, or the cash in lieu of water right dedication fee in effect at the time of building permit application. 
(3)  Fairway Avenue construction off-site impact fee as set forth in Appendix A to this Code. All such fees shall be held by the City in an interest-bearing account and shall be separately accounted for, for bookkeeping purposes. Such funds, and the interest attributable thereto, shall be used only for the construction of Fairway Avenue and for no other purpose whatsoever. The City may build Fairway Avenue in phases, provided that the first work accomplished shall be to complete that section of Fairway Avenue adjacent to Knollridge Development Area No. 1. The City shall pay twenty percent (20%) of the cost of the construction of Fairway Avenue and shall proceed with construction of the same at the earliest convenient date when sufficient funds are available, in order to minimize inflationary factors and provide the benefit anticipated to the properties in respect to which such off-site impact fee is paid. The City shall diligently monitor the pertinent economic and cost factors with the goal of expeditiously completing construction of Fairway Avenue at the earliest opportunity reasonably practicable. 
(4)  Subdivision improvement default remediation fee as set forth in Appendix A to this Code. 
(5)  24th Street completion fee as set forth in Appendix A to this Code, (applicable to Development Areas Nos. 1 and 2 only). 
(6)  Public improvement cost recovery fee, as determined in any subdivision improvements agreement entered into between the City and any landowner within the Knollridge PUD: 
a.  For any lot owner within a Development Area that is obligated to pay cost recovery to the developer of a different Development Plan. 
b.  For any lot owner within a Development Area that is obligated to pay cost recovery to the developer of a different Development Plan. 
(7)  Parking lot construction cost recovery fee: As determined in any amount entered into between the City and any landowner within the Knollridge PUD. 
(8)  Other Fees. All other fees required by this Code. 
(9)  Escalation. The fees set forth in Paragraphs (3), (4) and (5) above shall automatically escalate at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum commencing January 1, 1999, unless otherwise increased or decreased by resolution adopted by the City Council. 
(10)  Fee adjustment in the event of density modification or replat: The fees set forth in Paragraphs (3), (4) and (5) above are based upon the construction of the maximum number of multi-family units permissible under zoning regulations existing on the effective date of the initial ordinance codified herein within Development Area Nos. 1, 2 and 3, as set forth in the table below, and the assumption that Development Area No. 4 will contain fifty (50) single-family lots. In the event the density as constructed is different than the foregoing assumption or any portion of the Knollridge PUD is replatted, the fees per unit, on a per-lot basis within Development Areas Nos. 1, 2 and 3, and on a development area basis within Development Area No. 4, shall be adjusted to ensure that the necessary amount of fees collected from each multi-family lot and Development Area No. 4 are collected by the City to enable it to construct the contemplated improvements; provided, however, that the per-unit fees for Lots 4, 5, 6 and 13 within Development Area No. 1 shall not be reduced for construction of up to twelve (12) units per lot as permitted by Section 16-15-120(3) and (4) above. (Prior code 17.16.120; Ord. 4 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-15-170. - Replatting and phasing. 
    Except as expressly provided in this Article to the contrary, any development area within the Knollridge PUD, or any portion thereof, may be replatted and/or phased. Replatting shall be approved only in accordance with this Code. Phasing may be approved by the Planning Commission upon request by the lot owners, provided that each phase provides for the installation or construction of the public improvements necessary to serve the phase. Phasing shall not involve less than six (6) single-family units per phase; nor less than six (6) multi-family units per lot or the maximum number of units to be constructed on any lot, whichever is less; and the fees required to be paid pursuant to Section 16-15-160 above must be paid for all lots or units within the phase at the time of the first building permit for any lot or unit within that phase. (Prior code 17.16.120; Ord. 4 §1, 2005)

ARTICLE XVIII - CB Central Business District 
Division 1 - Introduction 

Sec. 16-18-10. - Applicability. 
    This Article functions as a separate component of Chapter 16 of this Code. All text, figures and tables in this Article are regulatory unless otherwise noted. Lands regulated by the provisions of this Article also are subject to all provisions of this Code. The provisions in this Article are intended to be consistent with the provisions of Articles I through XVII of Chapter 16. However, in cases where the provisions of this Article conflict with the provisions of other Articles, the provisions of this Article shall prevail. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-20. - Purpose and intent; Central Business District as a vibrant regional center. 
(a)  The primary goal of the Central Business District is to be a vibrant, pedestrian-oriented, commercial, residential, entertainment and cultural center. The standards set forth in this Article are designed to implement this goal as described in the City's 2008 Downtown Master Plan. This Article encourages development that enhances the City's economy, energy efficiency, appearance and quality of life through high-quality design. The intent is to create a nest of amenities to attract both City residents and residents of the wider region to the downtown. 
(b)  The intent of this Article is to encourage the following characteristics: 
(1)  A mix of land uses throughout the Central Business District with housing, shopping, services, entertainment and jobs located within walking distance of one another; 
(2)  Private and public community amenities that contribute to economic development; 
(3)  A range of housing options at different types and densities; 
(4)  Development densities and intensities that substantially exceed those of other areas of the City; 
(5)  A pedestrian-friendly atmosphere as it relates to infrastructure, development form and development character; 
(6)  Inclusion of public gathering places: indoor and outdoor, public and private; 
(7)  Incorporation of energy-efficient and sustainable building and site design features that make the downtown a model of sustainable urban design; 
(8)  Development patterns that accommodate a range of transportation choices; and 
(9)  Parking solutions that are complementary to and do not detract from a dense, pedestrian-oriented environment. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-30. - Central Business District Glossary of Design Concepts and Terms. 
(a)  The Central Business District Glossary of Design Concepts and Terms (hereafter the "CBD Glossary") is intended to ensure that the standards of this Article are applied consistently over time and to assist private land owners and developers in understanding and executing these standards. The CBD Glossary is a non-codified accompaniment to this Article; however, it is to be used as an official reference when evaluating a project's consistency with this Article. The CBD Glossary has been officially adopted by the City in association with this Article and is thus considered a regulatory document enforceable by law. 
(b)  Land use descriptions and other customary zoning ordinance terms not included in the CBD Glossary are defined in Section 16-1-220 of this Code. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-40. - Use of terms "required," "preferred," "discouraged" and "prohibited." 
    In order to achieve the goals of the 2008 Downtown Master Plan, this Article seeks to strike a balance between high standards and flexibility for development. Accordingly, throughout this Article many standards are expressed as one of the following terms. Where these terms are not included, the listed standards shall be deemed to be "required" and compliance with them is mandatory. 
(1)  Required design elements are those that must be included in a project to achieve consistency with the desired character of the Central Business District. Compliance with required design elements is mandatory, and failure to include them in a project will result in project denial. 
(2)  Preferred design elements are those that are consistent with and contributing to the desired character of the Central Business District. Although these design elements are not mandatory for a project, their inclusion in a project increases the likelihood of (although does not guarantee) project approval and an expedited review. Applicants are encouraged to incorporate as many preferred elements as possible. 
(3)  Discouraged design elements and land uses are those that are potentially inconsistent with and detracting from the desired character of the Central Business District. Although not prohibited, their inclusion in a project will decrease the likelihood of project approval and lengthen the review period. Projects that incorporate any discouraged design element will require a Tier 2 level of review as defined in Section 16-18-1240 of this Article. For each discouraged design element that is proposed, the applicant shall demonstrate why the element is appropriate and how its inclusion will not detract from the quality of the project or the stated goals and character of the applicable sub-district. 
(4)  Prohibited design elements are those that are highly inconsistent with the desired character of the Central Business District and may not be used under any circumstances. Inclusion of a prohibited design element in a project will result in project denial. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-50. - Variances and Planned Unit Developments prohibited. 
    Allowances for "preferred" and "discouraged" elements have been included throughout this Article and provide for the level of flexibility and creativity necessary to ensure exceptional development projects. As described in Section 16-18-40, above, regulations falling under the heading of "required" or "prohibited" are mandatory. Variances to any "required" or "prohibited" use or design element are not permitted. Planned Unit Developments of any type (as described in Article III, Division 6 of this Chapter) are prohibited throughout the entire Central Business District. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-60. - Overview of Central Business District. 
    Following the City's 2008 Downtown Master Plan, the Central Business District is divided into six (6) sub-districts. The following six (6) sub-districts are described in the divisions that follow and are identified on the City's Official Zoning Map. 
Historic Core (CBD-HC) 
Second Street Mixed-Use (CBD-MU) 
River Gateway (CBD-RG) 
Creekside Neighborhood (CBD-CS) 
Centennial Neighborhood (CBD-CN) 
North Gateway (CBD-NG) 
(Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Division 2 - Historic Core Sub-District 

Sec. 16-18-210. - Purpose. 
    The Historic Core sub-district represents the historic and cultural center of the community. The purpose of the sub-district is to preserve and restore the character and scale of most historic buildings and to promote complementary infill development and a high quality, pedestrian-oriented environment. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-220. - Overview of sub-district character. 
    The intent of this Section is to describe the desired character of the sub-district and serve as a guide to developers and the City throughout the development process. See Sections 16-18-230 and 16-18-240 below for more specificity on which items are required, preferred, discouraged and prohibited. 
(1)  Building scale and intensity. The scale of new buildings in the Historic Core should match existing historic development, which generally consists of two- to three-story buildings with a high percentage of lot coverage. The density and intensity of individual uses should be consistent with the lower scale of the buildings and be oriented to passing pedestrians more so than cars (although some civic uses may have larger draws). 
Figure 16-18-220-1

(2)  Redevelopment and preservation opportunities. As indicated in the 2008 Downtown Master Plan, the Historic Core sub-district is characterized by several high priority preservation sites that help set the tone for the character of new development projects. These include the entire southern block faces on Third Street from East Avenue to West Avenue, the northern block face of Third Street from East Avenue to Railroad Avenue and additional properties on Third Street and Fourth Street. Several opportunities also exist for infill and redevelopment, particularly at the edges of the sub-district on Third and Fourth Streets where the block faces should be continued all the way to East Avenue and West Avenue. 
(3)  Primary land uses. Land uses in the Historic Core should promote pedestrian activity. These include retail, restaurants and complementary service uses on the ground floor with upper-story residential or office uses and civic and public uses. 
(4)  General design characteristics. To maintain the City's historic and cultural integrity, the design of new development and modifications to existing development should be thoughtfully designed to complement the key historic design elements of this sub-district. This includes brick as the primary building material and large, ground floor storefront windows that contribute to the pedestrian-oriented character. Although the design of buildings should reflect the traditional characteristics of the sub-district, opportunities should be sought to incorporate energy efficient elements as well. 
(5)  Relationship of development to street. New buildings in the Historic Core should fill in the existing block faces along Third Street and Fourth Street, extending them all the way to East Avenue and West Avenue. Accordingly, buildings should be pulled up to the sidewalk and include large display windows to increase pedestrian interest and activity. The limited breaks in the block faces, such as those needed for small parking lots, should incorporate walls and landscaping and/or decorative structures that visually continue the block face across the opening. Building sides along Railroad Avenue should be similar to those on Third and Fourth Streets. Building and property sides along East Avenue and West Avenue also should be of high quality but are expected to have a lesser importance and are likely to provide secondary and service accesses. 
Figure 16-18-220-2

(6)  Parking. Parking requirements in the Historic Core should be met through a combination of diagonal on-street parking stalls and small surface parking lots situated to the side or rear of buildings, but preferably not at street corners. Structured parking is discouraged and should include a face of ground floor retail/commercial uses along Third Street and Fourth Street and Railroad Avenue if it is used. Likewise, large surface lots also are discouraged and all surface parking should be screened with walls and/or landscaping. 
(7)  Project review criteria. The City will evaluate proposed projects in the Historic Core based on the following considerations in addition to all of the other standards contained in Section 16-18-1260 of this Article: 
a.  Does the project enhance the Historic Core as the cultural center of the community and/or complement existing cultural amenities (e.g., historic theater, the museum and the historic post office)? 
b.  Does the project contribute to and enhance the western small-town charm of the Historic Core? 
c.  Does the project help preserve and sensitively restore historic buildings? 
d.  Does the project help preserve and restore the City's historic building pattern with complementary infill development? 
e.  Do the intensity, scale and overall design of the project enhance the pedestrian friendliness of this area? 
f.  Does the project preserve and complement historically representative structures? (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-230. - Site design standards. 
    The site design standards listed in Table 16-18-230 shall apply to all projects located within the Historic Core sub-district. See Division 5 of the CBD Glossary for illustrations and definitions of the concepts and terms used in the Table.

(Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Division 3 - North Gateway Sub-District 

Sec. 16-18-310. - Purpose. 
    The North Gateway sub-district is the northern entryway into the City's downtown. The purpose of the sub-district is to provide an attractive gateway into the downtown and create a transition between the auto-oriented commercial uses to the north and the pedestrian character of the Central Business District. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-320. - Overview of sub-district character. 
    The intent of this Section is to describe the desired character of the sub-district and serve as a guide to developers and the City throughout the development process. See Sections 16-18-330 and 16-18-340 below for more specificity on which items are required, preferred, discouraged and prohibited. 
(1)  Building scale and intensity. Buildings in the North Gateway should be consistent with the scale of the buildings in the Historic Core. However, the intensity of development may be somewhat greater than that in the Historic Core given that more auto-oriented uses are permitted in this sub-district. 
Figure 16-18-320-1 

(2)  Redevelopment and preservation opportunities. The existing buildings and properties within this sub-district all present opportunities for redevelopment. None were identified in the 2008 Downtown Master Plan as high-priority preservation sites. 
(3)  Primary land uses. This sub-district is intended to accommodate primarily commercial uses. Ground floor uses should consist of retail, personal services and restaurants with upper floor residential or offices. Auto-oriented uses also are permitted, such as service stations, provided that various standards are met. Land uses on Sixth Street should be compatible with the school located to the north, and those on the east and west ends of the sub-district should be compatible with the adjoining residential neighborhoods. 
(4)  General design characteristics. The intersection of Fifth Street and Railroad Avenue is the visual gateway into the downtown. Development on these corners should provide an attractive gateway through high-quality design and architectural elements oriented towards the intersection. Preferred exterior building materials are primarily brick with large ground floor windows to maintain a pedestrian-friendly character and vibrancy. Although simple, rectangular building forms consistent with those in the Historic Core are preferred, the lack of any historically significant buildings in this sub-district creates opportunities for somewhat more contemporary development. 
(5)  Relationship of development to street. Development on the corners of the Fifth Street/Railroad Avenue intersection should incorporate strong corner elements to create a strong sense of entry to the downtown. Throughout the North Gateway, buildings should include small setbacks and designs with high levels of transparency to encourage pedestrian activity. 
Figure 16-18-320-2 

(6)  Parking. Parking in the North Gateway should be located at the sides and rear of buildings and preferably not along Railroad Avenue. A mix of on-street spaces (both within this sub-district and within adjoining sub-districts) and smaller, well-screened on-site parking areas should be sufficient to address most of the anticipated parking needs of the district. 
(7)  Project review criteria. The City will evaluate proposed projects in the North Gateway based on the following considerations in addition to all of the other standards contained in Section 16-18-1260 of this Article: 
a.  Does the project contribute to a positive gateway experience to the Historic Core and Central Business District? 
b.  Does the project complement the character, scale and function of the Historic Core? 
c.  Does the project improve the appearance of properties in this sub-district? 
d.  Are the uses, scale and intensity of development along Sixth Street compatible with the school to the north? 
e.  Are the uses, scale and intensity of development at the east and west ends of the sub-district compatible with the adjoining residential neighborhoods? (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-330. - Site design standards. 
    The site design standards listed in Table 16-18-330 shall apply to all projects located within the North Gateway sub-district. See Division 5 of the CBD Glossary for illustrations and definitions of the concepts and terms used in the Table. Table 16-18-330

(Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Division 4 - Second Street Mixed Use Sub-District 

Sec. 16-18-410. - Purpose. 
    With only a few exceptions, the Second Street Mixed Use sub-district presents an opportunity for redevelopment of the entire sub-district. The purpose of the sub-district is to create high-quality, higher density, mixed use development and civic uses that bring vitality to the downtown. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-420. - Overview of sub-district character. 
    The intent of this Section is to describe the desired character of the sub-district and serve as a guide to developers and the City throughout the development process. See Sections 16-18-430 and 16-18-440 below for more specificity on which items are required, preferred, discouraged and prohibited. 
(1)  Building scale and intensity. The potential for redevelopment of most properties in the Second Street area permits a high level of density throughout the sub-district. Between East Avenue and West Avenue, the potential to assemble sites creates opportunities for large building footprints, but heights should be limited so as not to overshadow the neighboring Historic Core sub-district. West of West Avenue, building heights can increase to achieve a scale more consistent with that permitted in the high-density Creekside Neighborhood sub-district. While development within the Second Street area should respect the development scale and pattern in the Historic Core, the Second Street sub-district also should have a sufficiently high level of intensity to generate a concentration of activity and residents to increase the vibrancy of the downtown. 
Figure 16-18-420-1 

(2)  Redevelopment and preservation opportunities. The Second Street sub-district contains some of the City's most significant opportunities for larger-scale redevelopment projects. However, consistent with the 2008 Downtown Master Plan, the Rifle House should be preserved and adjoining development should be respectful of this historic structure. 
(3)  Primary land uses. Second Street should serve as a high-activity commercial and entertainment spine that attracts a regional market. A high level of focus should be placed on ground floor retail, restaurant and entertainment uses that literally spill out onto the sidewalk. Upper floors should contain a mix of commercial, office and residential uses. 
(4)  General design characteristics. Within the Second Street sub-district, attractive modern architectural and site design should be incorporated. This should include extensive use of ground floor windows, the integration of horizontal building elements on taller buildings and the use of high-quality building materials and architectural details. Wherever possible, buildings should incorporate exposed sustainability components such as sky lights, integrated solar panels, wind turbines, natural and local materials and similar features. Buildings located along Rifle Creek should relate to the creek by incorporating terraces and balconies oriented to the creek and footprints and stepbacks that maintain a comfortable pedestrian environment along the Rifle Creek trail. 
Figure 16-18-420-2 

(5)  Relationship of development to street. Buildings within the Second Street area should be pulled up to and oriented toward Second Street, Park Avenue and Highway 6/24 to encourage pedestrian activity. However, buildings can be set back as necessary to accommodate outdoor activity areas such as dining, artistic displays and public gathering areas. For taller buildings located west of West Avenue, upper stories should be stepped back to maintain a pedestrian-friendly experience along the street. Upper stories also should have a strong orientation to the street through the use of large windows, balconies and terraces. Second Street and Park Avenue should be extended consistent with the 2008 Downtown Master Plan to improve circulation within the downtown and the community. 
(6)  Parking. Given the desired intensity of development within the Second Street sub-district, parking will be a challenge that will have to be met using a number of tools. Second Street itself should accommodate significant on-street, angled parking. In addition, new development should look to incorporate parking structures either under and/or within the buildings. Parking structures on Second Street should be faced with commercial units to avoid large expanses of dead walls. Parking also may be phased as development occurs. Surface parking lots may be provided initially that are later converted to structures. Large expanses of surface parking should not be considered a long-term solution if the sub-district is to achieve the desired level of intensity and activity. Accordingly, flexibility, public-private partnerships and shared arrangements between various property owners all will be necessary to meet this challenge. 
(7)  Project review criteria. The City will evaluate proposed projects in the Second Street Mixed-Use sub-district based on the following considerations, in addition to all of the other standards contained in Section 16-18-1260 of this Article: 
a.  Do the proposed land uses contribute to the desired dynamic, mixed-use character of the sub-district? 
b.  Does the project take advantage of the potential to assemble lots to develop larger-scale uses? 
c.  Does the project have an appropriate level of density/intensity to foster a high level of activity along Second Street and throughout the downtown? 
d.  Does the project encourage people to gather in this area of the City and create a pedestrian-oriented atmosphere? 
e.  Where applicable, does the project extend Second Street and Park Avenue consistent with the circulation plan contained in the 2008 Downtown Master Plan? 
f.  Does development along Rifle Creek relate to the creek by creating strong visual connections and providing a comfortable pedestrian environment along the creekfront trail? 
g.  Does development adjoining priority preservation sites complement those sites and set them apart in a visually attractive and respectful manner? (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-430. - Site design standards. 
    The site design standards listed in Table 16-18-430 shall apply to all projects located within the Second Street Mixed Use sub-district. See Division 5 of the CBD Glossary for illustrations and definitions of the concepts and terms used in the Table.

(Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Division 5 - River Gateway Sub-District 

Sec. 16-18-510. - Purpose. 
    The River Gateway sub-district encompasses lands along Highway 6/24 and Highway 13 and is the most important gateway into the downtown. The sub-district's location also offers attractive views of the Colorado River, valley floor and surrounding bluffs. The purpose of the sub-district is to ensure that new development shapes favorable first impressions of the Central Business District through the presence of high-quality, large-scale regional destinations. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-520. - Overview of sub-district character. 
    The intent of this Section is to describe the desired character of the sub-district and serve as a guide to developers and the City throughout the development process. See Sections 16-18-530 and 16-18-540 below for more specificity on which items are required, preferred, discouraged and prohibited. 
(1)  Building scale and intensity. The intensive nature of the potential uses should result in buildings with large footprints and multiple stories that draw attention to the River Gateway area from outside of the downtown, including I-70. Accordingly, "signature" and iconic building designs should be considered to serve as guideposts for drawing visitors and those just passing through to the downtown. 
Figure 16-18-520-1 

(2)  Redevelopment and preservation opportunities. No sites or buildings in this sub-district were identified in the 2008 Downtown Master Plan as high-priority preservation sites. This sub-district offers significant and large-scale redevelopment and infill opportunities. The entire sub-district should be developed under a single master plan. 
(3)  Primary land uses. The River Gateway is intended to accommodate high-quality, higher-intensity commercial, hospitality, entertainment and civic uses, as well as higher density, multi-family residential development. The sub-district also is a potential location for a major transit center that could transform the downtown into a transit-oriented development. 
(4)  General design characteristics. Development within the River Gateway should be characterized by high-quality urban architecture and "one-of-a-kind" structures. Building elements should include those that expose their sustainable components such as skylights, integrated solar panels, natural and local materials and similar features. In addition, street frontage improvements, landscaping and attractive signage should enhance this area as the primary "gateway" to the downtown and the entire community. The larger parcels and lack of alleys in this sub-district coupled with uses of a regional nature will likely result in an urban campus-type of development pattern. 
(5)  Relationship of development to street. Consistent with the 2009 Rifle Gateway Alternatives Report, Highway 6/24 is expected to flank the north and south sides of the district as a one-way couplet with Railroad Avenue, West Avenue and Park Avenue extended south to the new eastbound leg of Highway 6/24. Buildings should have a strong visual orientation to Highways 6/24 and 13 even if their main entries face an internal street. Buildings may be pulled up to the sidewalks or sites may have highly landscaped setbacks that provide sufficient buffering from the high traffic levels on the adjoining highways. Upper floors should be oriented toward views of the river and the ranges to the south and north. 
Figure 16-18-520-2 

(6)  Parking. Parking needs in the River Gateway are likely to be substantial and will likely eventually require one (1) or more parking structures. These structures should be fully integrated into the overall development by reflecting the high quality materials used on the principal buildings. Parking may be phased over time, starting with screened surface lots that are eventually converted to structures. However, surface parking between buildings and the adjoining thoroughfares should be minimized, with the majority of parking placed toward the center of the district, between buildings. 
(7)  Project review criteria. The City will evaluate proposed projects in the River Gateway sub-district based on the following considerations in addition to all of the other standards contained in Section 16-18-1260 of this Article: 
a.  Does the project contribute to a positive City gateway experience, putting forth a high-quality image for the Central Business District and the entire City? 
b.  Does the project have an appropriate level of density/intensity to foster a dynamic, mixed-use environment with regional scale uses and/or transit-oriented development? 
c.  Do the buildings and uses provide a recognizable destination that will draw visitors into the downtown and to the riverfront? 
d.  Does the building incorporate a "one-of-a-kind," high-quality design? 
e.  Does the development accommodate the proposed one-way couplet for Highway 6/24 and extensions of the north-south avenues? 
f.  Does the development provide strong visual connections to the Colorado River?

(Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Division 6 - Creekside Neighborhood Sub-District 

Sec. 16-18-610. - Purpose. 
    The Creekside Neighborhood sub-district represents the best location for high quality, higher-density residential development in all of the City. The purposes of the sub-district are to promote high-density development so that residents can walk to a wide variety of commercial, entertainment and civic uses in the downtown and provide support for downtown businesses. Development should also create an attractive visual gateway when entering downtown from the west. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-620. - Overview of sub-district character. 
    The intent of this Section is to describe the desired character of the sub-district and serve as a guide to developers and the City throughout the development process. See Sections 16-18-630 and 16-18-640 below for more specificity on which items are required, preferred, discouraged and prohibited. 
(1)  Building scale and intensity. Residential development in Creekside Neighborhood is intended to be more intensive than anywhere else in the City. Located at the foot of a tall bluff to the north, this sub-district can accommodate very tall buildings without blocking views of the river valley from existing neighborhoods. High-density residential on this site will support street level activity and pedestrian-oriented uses and ensure the long-term vibrancy of the entire downtown. 
Figure 16-18-620-1 

(2)  Redevelopment and preservation opportunities. The entire Creekside Neighborhood is currently vacant and under single ownership. As a result, Rifle Creek and Highway 6/24 are the only constraints to development. The entire district should be developed under a single master plan. 
(3)  Primary land uses. The Creekside Neighborhood should be comprised primarily of high-density, high-quality residential development with some potential for commercial uses on the ground floor. High-quality lodging may be acceptable, but all other freestanding commercial uses are prohibited given the importance of having increased residential densities in the downtown and this sub-district's unique ability to accommodate such densities. 
(4)  General design characteristics. Development within the Creekside Neighborhood should maximize the use of high-quality building materials and should be oriented to take advantage of views of Rifle Creek and the Colorado River. Horizontal building and other elements should be integrated into taller buildings to blend with background bluffs. Where possible, buildings also should expose their sustainable components, such as skylights, integrated solar panels, natural and local materials and similar features. 
(5)  Relationship of development to street. Buildings in the Creekside Neighborhood should have a strong visual orientation to Highway 6/24 even if their main entries are located toward the interior of the sub-district. Buildings may be pulled up to the sidewalk or sites may have highly landscaped setbacks that provide sufficient buffering from the high traffic levels on Highway 6/24. Rifle Creek should be embraced as a key site amenity with building elevations that relate to the creek by incorporating terraces and balconies oriented to the creek and footprints and stepbacks that maintain a comfortable pedestrian environment along the creekfront trail. Likewise, upper floors should be oriented toward views of the creek and the Colorado River. Services and "back-of-house" activities should be located between buildings and not between the buildings and the highway or Rifle Creek. 
Figure 16-18-620-2 

(6)  Parking. Parking needs in the Creekside Neighborhood will be significant and will likely require the development of several parking structures. These structures should be fully integrated into the overall development by reflecting the high-quality materials used on the principal buildings. Parking may be phased over time, starting with well-designed and screened surface lots that are eventually converted to structures. However, surface parking lots located between buildings and the highway should be minimized with the majority of parking placed toward the center of the sub-district. The proximity of transit stops should be closely evaluated, as well as the inclusion of "carshares," shuttles or other methods that reduce the potential parking demands of residents. 
(7)  Project review criteria. The City will evaluate proposed projects in the Creekside Neighborhood sub-district based on the following considerations, in addition to all of the other standards contained in Section 16-18-1260 of this Article: 
a.  Does the project contribute to a positive City gateway experience, putting forth a high-quality image for the Central Business District? 
b.  Is the proposed level of density consistent with the opportunities presented by the site and the need to increase residential development in the downtown? 
c.  Does development provide strong visual connections to Rifle Creek and the Colorado River? (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-630. - Site design standards. 
    The site design standards listed in Table 16-18-630 shall apply to all projects located within the Creekside Neighborhood sub-district. See Division 5 of the CBD Glossary for illustrations and definitions of the concepts and terms used in the Table.

(Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Division 7 - Centennial Neighborhood Sub-District 

Sec. 16-18-710. - Purpose. 
    The Centennial Neighborhood sub-district represents an opportunity to increase residential density adjacent to the Historic Core, Centennial Park and the Rifle Creek Trail. The purpose of this sub-district is to promote the revitalization of this area and to encourage the development of a high-quality, medium- to high-density, pedestrian-oriented, downtown neighborhood. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-720. - Overview of sub-district character. 
    The intent of this Section is to describe the desired character of the sub-district and serve as a guide to developers and the City throughout the development process. See Sections 16-18-730 and 16-18-740 below for more specificity on which items are required, preferred, discouraged and prohibited. 
(1)  Building scale and intensity. The Centennial Neighborhood is intended to consist of medium- to high-density, high quality residential development in the form of townhomes, apartments and condominiums with some opportunities for compatible commercial uses in mixed-use buildings or small-scale, freestanding structures. All buildings should have a pedestrian/residential scale and a strong relationship to the adjoining street grid to encourage residents to walk into the more commercial-oriented districts of the downtown. 
(2)  Redevelopment and preservation opportunities. The Centennial Neighborhood offers many opportunities for redevelopment projects by assembling marginal single-family home sites and the redevelopment or outright replacement of existing, marginal multi-family buildings and commercial properties. Although the 2008 Downtown Master Plan did not identify any high-priority preservation sites in this sub-district, there are some single-family homes with historic characteristics that are in good shape that should be preserved on-site or relocated to other residential neighborhoods in the community. These homes also may be candidates for appropriate conversion to commercial uses or live/work units. 
Figure 16-18-720-1 

(3)  Primary land uses. The Centennial Neighborhood should consist primarily of moderate- to higher-density residential uses, complemented by some small-scale commercial development. Although the scale and density of buildings should be scaled to pedestrians and reflective of a residential neighborhood, it is equally important that the residential density in this sub-district is not so low that opportunities are missed to add needed residents to the downtown that support downtown businesses. 
(4)  General design characteristics. New development within the Centennial Neighborhood should be characterized by traditional brick and wood frame building materials with articulated facades that maintain the residential character of the neighborhood. Larger assembled parcels should be designed to preserve the historic street grid pattern, including the alleys where appropriate, with primary building entries placed along the east-west streets within the district. However, site plans also should orient and draw residents to Rifle Creek and Centennial Park where they adjoin the development. 
(5)  Relationship of development to street. In keeping with the residential character of the district, modest front yards should be provided where possible. Porches and balconies are desirable additions that will help strengthen the orientation of the buildings toward the street. 
Figure 16-18-720-2 

(6)  Parking. On-street parking provided throughout the Centennial Neighborhood should primarily serve visitors. On-site parking should be located to the sides and rear of buildings and never between buildings and a primary street. Resident parking may include well-screened surface lots, private garages or underground structures located beneath the buildings. Proximity to transit stops should be closely evaluated and the inclusion of "car-shares" or other methods of reducing auto needs should be considered. 
(7)  Project review criteria. The City will evaluate proposed projects in the Centennial Neighborhood sub-district based on the following considerations in addition to all of the other standards contained in Section 16-18-1260 of this Article: 
a.  Does the project take appropriate advantage of site assembly opportunities? 
b.  Does the project contribute to the revitalization of this neighborhood? 
c.  Does the project preserve the residential character of this area? 
d.  Is the proposed level of density consistent with the opportunities presented by the site and the need to increase residential development in the downtown? 
e.  Does the project take appropriate advantage of its proximity to Centennial Park? 
f.  If a commercial use is being proposed, is the use and its location/configuration compatible with the residential neighborhood character? (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-730. - Site design standards. 
    The site design standards listed in Table 16-18-730 shall apply to all projects located within the Centennial Neighborhood sub-district. See Division 5 of the CBD Glossary for illustrations and definitions of the concepts and terms used in the Table.

Division 9 - Parking Standards 

Sec. 16-18-910. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this Division is to ensure that adequate parking is provided to cover the needs of downtown businesses, residents and visitors while also ensuring that the Central Business District can be developed to its fullest. This requires careful balancing and a high level of creativity on the part of developers, property owners, businesses, residents and the City. All parties must look for ways to address parking needs through a wide variety of cost-effective solutions while maintaining an attractive, pedestrian-friendly area. Accordingly, large surface parking areas are discouraged and parking partnerships are strongly encouraged through phased approaches. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-920. - Applicability. 
(a)  Sub-districts and conflicts. This Division shall apply within all Central Business District sub-districts. Where the site development regulations of a particular sub-district conflict with the regulations of this Division, the sub-district regulations shall prevail. Likewise, several cross references to the standards in Article VII, "Parking and Loading" are contained herein. Where the regulations in that Article conflict with this Division, the regulations of this Division shall prevail. 
(b)  New development. The off-street parking and loading standards of this Division shall apply to any new building and to any new land use established. 
(c)  Expansions. The off-street parking and loading standards of this Division shall apply when an existing structure or use is expanded. Additional off-street parking and loading spaces shall be required to serve only the expanded area. 
(d)  Change in use. No additional off-street parking shall be required for any change of use except in the case of a change from one (1) nonconforming, nonresidential use to another as per Subsection 16-18-1110(d) of this Article, in which case the Planning and Zoning Commission may impose parking requirements as deemed appropriate and necessary to adequately accommodate the needs of the new use. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-930. - Parking and loading requirements. 
(a)  Exemptions. 
(1)  The first five thousand (5,000) gross square feet of nonresidential use shall be exempt from all off-street parking and loading requirements. Parking for such buildings is intended to be absorbed by on-street parking and public parking facilities throughout the Central Business District. 
a.  Parking requirements contained in this Division shall apply only to nonresidential portions of buildings larger than five thousand (5,000) gross square feet and to residential uses. 
b.  For purposes of this Division, the first five thousand (5,000) gross square feet shall be that nonresidential area with the highest parking requirement as per Section 16-7-20. 
(2)  Residential uses of any size or type are exempt from having to provide any off-street parking for guests. 
(b)  Alternatives for developing parking calculations. For buildings with more than five thousand (5,000) gross square feet of nonresidential uses and all residential uses, the applicant may propose and the City may accept at its discretion any one (1) of the following three (3) alternatives for determining the number of off-street parking and loading spaces to be provided: 
(1)  The standards listed in Section 16-7-20 of this Code. This standard shall represent both the minimum and maximum number of off-street parking spaces permitted; or 
(2)  A blended ratio of one (1) parking space per two hundred fifty (250) gross square feet; or 
(3)  For buildings with any land use or combination of uses, the applicant may prepare a project-specific parking demand analysis in accordance with Section 16-18-940. 
(c)  City acceptance. The City reserves the right to accept, accept with conditions or deny any proposal for an alternative number of off-street parking spaces or loading spaces, regardless of the method or findings of a parking analysis. In no case, however, shall the City require more parking than that required in Paragraph (b)(1) or (2) above, whichever is less. In order to further the purpose and intent of this Division, the City may prepare its own parking demand analysis in accordance with Section 16-18-940 below for any project exceeding fifteen thousand (15,000) gross square feet should the applicant not elect to prepare one of his or her own. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-940. - Parking and loading demand analysis. 
(a)  Demand analysis content. Where a parking and loading demand analysis is prepared to determine the number of required parking spaces as per Paragraph 16-18-930(b)(3) above, the analysis shall: 
(1)  Be prepared by a credentialed professional in the area of analyzing parking demand, using a professionally accepted methodology (such as that provided by the Institute of Traffic Engineers) and that takes into consideration local automobile usage patterns (rather than relying solely on national standards or patterns). 
(2)  Be specific to the proposed uses and site conditions and describe in detail the methodology used to prepare the analysis, including all calculations and assumptions used. 
(3)  Include a description of any and all strategies being used by the applicant to reduce parking demand (also see Subsection (b) below). Where a strategy relies on some form of ongoing operation (such as the provision of a community car, shuttle bus, shared parking between different property owners, etc.), the method of guaranteeing continuous service shall be indicated. Where existing public transit is used as part of a strategy, a guarantee of future service shall not be required. 
(4)  Include a comparison of the parking space requirements under Section 16-7-20 of this Chapter to the proposed number of parking spaces. 
(b)  Reduction strategies. Applicants are encouraged to explore a variety of strategies for reducing parking demand, including but not limited to the following: 
(1)  Shared parking, on-site. This strategy works well in projects with a mix of uses that have different peak times. The strategy also may be employed with multi-phase projects where the parking requirements are recalculated with each phase to realize efficiencies as more uses are added. 
(2)  Shared parking, off-site. A shared parking agreement between two (2) or more different project/property owners can be an effective method of reaching larger economies of scale to reduce the overall parking requirements of the individual projects. The agreement shall be prepared in a form acceptable to the City Attorney and recorded prior to the issuance of a building permit for any of the properties involved. The agreement shall be in effect for the life of the project or other time frame as agreed to by the City, and the City shall be included as an interested party to the agreement, such that the agreement cannot be amended or terminated without City approval. 
(3)  Public transit. Larger developments that are likely to draw employees and/or visitors from outside of the City and that include transit stops within the project may be able to realize parking reductions. All proposed transit stops shall be approved by the transit provider. 
(4)  Provision of a community or company car. This strategy may work for larger residential or employment projects. If used, the applicant will be required to provide some form of guarantee that the community or company car will be provided on a continuous basis for the life of the project or other time frame as agreed to by the City. 
(5)  Provision of a shuttle bus. This too may be an acceptable strategy for larger residential or employment projects or for multiple projects that share in the cost. Again, some form of guarantee will be required that service will be provided on a continuous basis for the life of the project or other time frame as agreed to by the City. 
(6)  Deed restrictions. Deed restrictions that limit the number of cars occupants may have at a project may be an effective strategy, particularly for residential units. The form of the deed restriction shall be subject to approval by the City, and the City shall be included as an interested party to the restriction, such that the restriction cannot be removed without City approval. 
(c)  Fee in lieu of on-site parking. Should the City create a more formal parking system and accept fees in lieu of on-site parking, applicants are strongly encouraged to consider this option. The ratio of on-site spaces to those to be provided by the City shall be determined by the City on a project-by-project basis based on a variety of considerations including the location of the project, location of the City-provided parking, types of project land uses, existing parking demands in the area of the project and future parking demands in the area of the project, among others. 
(d)  Parking location. For nonresidential land uses, required off-street parking spaces may be located anywhere in the Central Business District. Parking for residential uses shall be provided within six hundred (600) feet from the primary entrance to the residential structure or, in the case of multiple structures or multiple entrances, to the center of the project site. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-950. - Parking and loading report. 
    All projects that require off-street parking shall submit, as part of their application, a parking report that includes the following information: 
(1)  If no parking analysis is prepared, calculations showing how many off-street parking spaces are required based on one (1) of the other standards listed in Subsection 16-18-930(b) of this Article. 
(2)  Description of how all parking needs will be met, including a discussion of available on-street parking; structured, shared and public parking facilities; and any fees in lieu of parking being paid by the applicant. 
(3)  If development will be phased, how parking requirements and demand will be met over time. This includes strategies for phasing in structured parking to replace surface lot parking. 
(4)  Any proposed alternative parking space and aisle dimensions (see Section 16-18-960 below). (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-960. - Dimensions and design standards for stacking, parking and loading spaces. 
(a)  All off-street parking spaces and aisles shall be provided in accordance with the design standards contained in Section 16-7-140 of this Chapter. 
(b)  All loading areas shall be provided in accordance with the standards contained in Section 16-7-150 of this Chapter. 
(c)  All vehicle stacking areas shall be provided in accordance with the design standards contained in Section 16-7-120 of this Chapter. 
(d)  All accessible parking for physically handicapped persons shall be provided in accordance with the design standards contained in Section 16-7-130 of this Chapter. 
(e)  Applicants who wish to propose deviations from any of the above standards may do so through the required parking report described in Section 16-18-950 above. The City reserves the right to approve, conditionally approve or deny such proposals. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-970. - General design and layout standards for surface and structured parking.

Sec. 16-18-1020. - Specific land use regulations. 
    General regulations and standards applicable to each land use category listed in Table 16-18-1010 above have been listed in this Section. Definitions of each of the land use categories are provided in Section 16-1-220 of this Chapter. Section 16-3-110 of this Chapter empowers the Planning Director to make interpretations on matters regarding specific land use proposals that are not addressed by this Section. 
(1)  Residential uses. 
a.  Group care facilities (One [1] to eight [8] residents). Group care facilities with more than eight (8) residents shall be considered Indoor Institutional - General or Indoor Institutional - Intensive uses (depending on the size) and will be subject to the regulations associated with that land use category. 
b.  Live-work unit. 
1.  All commercial uses permitted in the underlying zoning sub-district shall be permitted in live-work units, with the exception of the following:

3.  Businesses involving the coming and going of customers, clients and/or patients shall not be permitted within a multi-family building in which units take access from a shared interior hallway. 
4.  A wall dividing the living space from the work space is not required in any live-work unit, but each unit shall be separated from all other uses in the building and shall have separate access either from the building exterior or from an interior corridor that is separate from such other uses. 
5.  Within each live-work unit, a maximum of two (2) employees from outside the household shall be permitted. 
6.  Signage shall be permitted in accordance with the regulations for home occupation signage (see Paragraph 16-3-280(c)(6) of this Chapter). 
7.  See the CBD Glossary, Section 330 for parking standards.

9.  Between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., occupants of a live-work unit shall cease all externally detectable work operations, including the coming and going of customers, clients and employees, the delivery and shipping of goods and materials and the unloading or loading of vehicles. 
(2)  Community facility uses. 
a.  Indoor institutional - intensive. All structures shall be located a minimum of fifty (50) feet from any property zoned LDR, MDR, MDR-X or CBD-CN. 
b.  Outdoor institutional. All structures and actively used outdoor recreation areas shall be located a minimum of fifty (50) feet from any property zoned LDR, MDR, MDR-X or CBD-CN, even if the outdoor institutional use is itself located on a property zoned CBD-CN. 
c.  Public services and utilities. All structures shall be located a minimum of twenty (20) feet from any property zoned LDR, MDR-X or CBD-CN, even if the public services and utilities use is itself located on a property zoned CBD-CN. 
(3)  Commercial uses. 
a.  Office and personal services. For multi-tenant buildings with ground-floor areas larger than seven thousand five hundred (7,500) square feet within the CBD-HC and CBD-MU sub-districts, ground-floor office uses shall not occupy more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total gross floor area of the ground floor of the building.

The same requirements also apply to increased or new outdoor areas used for outdoor operations or storage. The off-street parking and loading standards of Division 9 of this Article shall apply when an existing structure or use is expanded. Additional off-street parking and loading spaces shall be required to serve only the expanded area. 
(3)  Expansion of structures with nonconforming setbacks. Any nonconforming structure that was legally established prior to the adoption of this Article that houses a conforming use and conforms to height requirements, but that includes nonconforming minimum setback requirements, may be expanded either horizontally or vertically, subject to the following conditions. Said expansion shall be subject to a Tier 2 level of review: 
a.  The expansion does not further reduce the nonconforming minimum setback or increase the nonconforming maximum setback from any property lines. 
b.  The expansion does not result in a nonconforming setback where existing setbacks are in compliance. 
c.  The expansion complies with district height requirements. 
(f)  Determination of "integral" nonconforming design elements. Subject to a Tier 2 review, an applicant may request that the Planning Commission permit the continuation of a prohibited design element or permit the exclusion of a required design element, subject to the following: 
(1)  The Planning Commission must find that the design element is an integral part of the design or function of the existing structure or site. In addition to the Tier 2 review criteria of Section 16-18-1260 of this Article, the following standards shall apply: 
a.  Prohibited design elements not already present on the existing structure or site shall not be introduced by the expansion, restoration or remodel. 
b.  Integral design elements shall not include cosmetic elements such as, but not limited to, paint colors. 
c.  Prohibited design elements shall not have a more prominent appearance on the expanded, restored or remodeled portion of the structure or site than it had on the previously existing structure or site. 
d.  The cost of the expansion, restoration or remodeling project shall not exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the existing value of the structure. In cases where the expansion, restoration or remodeling costs exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the value of the existing structure, the entire structure shall be brought into conformity with this Article. 
(g)  Destruction and replacement of nonconforming structures. 
(1)  If a nonconforming structure sustains damages equal to or less than sixty-five percent (65%) of its pre-damaged value, said structure may be restored subject to a Tier 1 level of review per Section 16-18-1230 of this Article and the following criteria are met: 
a.  All portions of the structure were not or are not located on or over a property line;

e.  A building permit is obtained within six (6) months from the date of the damage; 
f.  The Certificate of Occupancy or other final inspection is issued within one (1) year of issuance of the building permit; 
(2)  If a nonconforming structure housing a conforming use sustains damages equal to or more than sixty-five percent (65%) of its pre-damaged value, repair of said structure shall not be permitted unless restoration results in a structure and site improvements conforming to all applicable requirements of this Article as if it were on a vacant or undeveloped lot. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-1150. - Nonconforming lots. 
(a)  Authority to continue. Any vacant nonconforming lot or parcel of land that was a lot of record at the time of adoption of this Article and that does not adjoin another vacant lot held in common ownership may be utilized for a permissible use, subject to the site and building design standards of the applicable sub-district and to the provisions of Section 16-18-1010 of this Article. 
(b)  Nonconforming lots adjacent to lots in common ownership. If a nonconforming lot abuts one (1) or more lots under common ownership and that have continuous public street frontage, these lots shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Article. No portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner that diminishes compliance with the lot width and area requirements established by this Article. Any division of said parcel must result in lots that comply with the width, area and frontage requirements of the applicable zoning sub-district, except in the following situations: 
(1)  If there is a single vacant nonconforming lot of record at the time of adoption of this Article adjacent to and held in common ownership with a lot or lots already occupied by a permitted use and both the occupied lot and the vacant lot have at least ninety percent (90%) of the minimum area and minimum width required for the use and applicable sub-district, the vacant nonconforming lot may be used for a permitted use. 
(2)  If there are two (2) vacant, nonconforming lots of record at the time of adoption of this Article that have continuous public street frontage and are held in common ownership and both lots have at least ninety percent (90%) of the minimum area and minimum width required for the applicable sub-district, the vacant, nonconforming lots may be used for a permissible use.

    The Planning Director may permit one (1) extension of up to twelve (12) additional months to the time periods for abandonment, obtaining a building permit and/or completing construction, provided that the applicant can demonstrate that circumstances out of his or her control have prevented a good faith attempt to reestablish or rebuild the nonconforming use and/or structure. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, health of the applicant or dependent family member, court proceedings, failure to reach insurance settlements, natural disasters or similar hardships. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-1170. - Determination of value. 
    For the purposes of this Chapter, the existing value of a structure and/or property shall mean the current or most recent value based on the Garfield County market valuation or a third party appraisal acceptable to the City. For the purposes of this Division, the pre-damaged value means the value of the nonconforming land use or structure before damage occurred; the pre-improved value means the value of the nonconforming land use or structure prior to the initiation of any restoration or remodeling activities; and the pre-expanded value means the value of the nonconforming land use or structure before the construction of any building additions (i.e., increases in the total gross square footage of the structure). (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-1180. - Evidence of status - nonconforming lots, uses, sites, structures, residential density/number of units. 
(a)  The nonconforming regulations of this Article apply only to legally established, nonconforming lots, uses, sites, structures or residential densities. 
(b)  All property owners with nonconforming uses, lots, sites and structures at the time of adoption of this Article shall have twelve (12) months from the date of adoption to register with the City Planning and Development Department. At a minimum, the registration shall include details that apply to the nature of the nonconformity. This may include a description of the property's land use; the number, type and size of dwelling units on the property (for residential uses only); the size of the lot; building setbacks; building height; the amount of landscaped area; and/or the number of on-site parking spaces. The registration also shall include evidence that the nonconformity was legally established in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. The form of the registration and the information required shall be determined by the Planning Director. 
(c)  In accordance with Article V, Division 6 of this Chapter, the Board of Adjustment may hear appeals to determinations of established property status, property use, property value and other facts relevant to permit determinations made by the Planning Director or other designated City official. Owners who are unable to prove to the satisfaction of the Planning Director that nonconforming aspects of property were legally established prior to adoption of this Article may appeal to the Board of Adjustment for a variance as set forth in Section 16-5-530 of this Chapter. The Board of Adjustment shall consider the following when deciding the merit of such an appeal: 
(1)  Any and all documentation regarding the development history of the property, both permitted and unpermitted. 
(2)  The number, type and disposition of Article violations on the property; the length of time the current owner has had the property; and whether violations preceded that ownership. 
(3)  The degree of nonconformity in use, structure, lots and/or site improvements, including but not limited to parking and landscaping. 
(4)  The potential impacts that granting indefinite rebuilding rights would have on nearby properties. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011)

(Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-1230. - Tier 1 review process. 
    For all activities requiring a CBD-Development Permit Tier 1 level of review, the following procedures shall apply: 
(1)  Preapplication conference. 
a.  Applicability. Applicants are required to meet with the Planning staff to review the proposed development prior to submitting an application. The applicant is responsible for scheduling the preapplication conference with the Planning staff. The Planning Department may waive the preapplication conference when the Planning Director finds substantial evidence to show that the purposes of this Article can be met without having to conduct such a conference. 
b.  Purpose. The general purpose of a preapplication conference is to provide an opportunity for Planning staff to accomplish the following: 
1.  Obtain a complete understanding of the proposed project and the applicant's critical deadlines, such as property closing dates and preferred construction and operation dates. 
2.  Identify and explain to the applicant the approval process, submittal requirements, fees and other items necessary for a complete application and a project that meets the requirements of this Article. 
(2)  Submittal of applications. 
a.  Completeness. Applicants shall prepare and submit an application as per the requirements in Article VI, Divisions 1 and 2 of this Chapter, including any applicable fees. For all projects, the Planning staff shall have five (5) calendar days to review the application for the purposes of determining its completeness. 
b.  Distribution for review and comment. The City and other referral agencies shall have fifteen (15) working days to review the application. 
(3)  Tier 1 project review criteria. Staff shall use the following criteria when making a decision on a Tier 1 project: 
a.  The project is consistent with the 2008 Downtown Master Plan and the Comprehensive Plan. 
b.  The project contributes to the City's goal of enhancing the Central Business District as a vibrant, pedestrian-oriented and mixed-use environment as described in Section 16-18-20 of this Article. 
c.  The project meets all applicable requirements of this Article for a Tier 1 review. 
d.  The project will not impede the development and improvement of surrounding property in the manner intended by this Article. 
(4)  Staff decision. 
a.  Within thirty (30) calendar days of when the application is deemed complete, the Planning Director shall issue a decision to either approve, conditionally approve or deny the application. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the decision of the Planning Director, including the reasons for a denial. 
b.  The Planning Director may impose conditions of approval to ensure compliance with the applicable standards stated in this Code. The Planning Director shall include a copy of the conditions with the record of decision. 
c.  In instances where the Planning Director finds that the application does not meet all of the applicable criteria for approval, he or she may allow the applicant to revise and resubmit the application in response to staff findings and comments. For all resubmitted applications, the Planning Director shall have five (5) days to determine the completeness of the application and thirty (30) days to issue his or her decision. If an applicant fails to resubmit an application within six (6) months of receiving the staff comments, the application shall be deemed to have been withdrawn. In lieu of revising and resubmitting the application, an applicant may instead request a final decision of denial and then shall have the option of filing an appeal consistent with Subparagraph d. below. 
d.  The applicant may appeal the Planning Director's decision to the Planning and Zoning Commission within ten (10) calendar days of the issuance of the Planning Director's decision, per the procedures in Section 16-18-1290. Filing an appeal shall stay the issuance of all other permits by the City and all construction on the project until the appeal is acted upon. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-1240. - Tier 2 review process. 
    For all activities requiring a Tier 2 level of review, the following procedures shall apply: 
(1)  Preapplication conference. 
a.  Applicability. Applicants are required to meet with the Planning staff to review the proposed development prior to their submittal of an application. The applicant is responsible for scheduling the preapplication conference with the Planning staff. The Planning Department may waive the preapplication conference when, in the Planning Director's discretion, there is substantial evidence to show that the purposes of this Article can be met without having to conduct such a conference. 
b.  Purpose. The general purpose of a preapplication conference is to provide an opportunity for the Planning staff to accomplish the following: 
1.  Obtain a complete understanding of the proposed project and the applicant's critical deadlines, such as property closing dates and preferred construction and operation dates. 
2.  Identify and explain to the applicant the approval process, submittal requirements, fees and other items necessary for a complete application and a project that meets the requirements of this Article. 
(2)  Procedures. Projects requiring a Tier 2 level of review shall follow the procedures in Article 5 of this Chapter for subjects not addressed by this Section, including but not limited to Sections 16-5-220, 16-5-250, 16-5-260, 16-5-270 and 16-5-280 and Paragraph 16-5-290(a)(5). 
(3)  Optional concept plan review. Prior to submitting a formal application, an applicant may choose to submit a concept plan for review by the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
a.  A concept plan review provides an applicant with general, nonbinding direction regarding his or her proposal. Although it is the intent of this process to be as helpful as possible to an applicant in designing a proposed project, applicants should not rely on this direction as an indication of any future decision-making by the Planning and Zoning Commission on any subsequent requests for development approval. The City explicitly disclaims any direction on the outcome of any future decision-making. 
b.  The individual members of the Planning and Zoning Commission may provide any and all comments, questions, critiques and direction they deem appropriate to assist the applicant with preparing a subsequent application. These comments are strictly advisory. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall not take a formal vote on any portion of the concept plan. 
(4)  Planning Commission scope of review. During a Tier 2 review, the Planning Commission shall approve, approve with conditions or deny "discouraged" uses, "discouraged" design elements and other sections of this Article that require a Tier 2 review. The Planning Commission shall not review or make a decision on "preferred" uses, "preferred" design elements or other sections of this Article that are designated as Tier 1 review or are otherwise permitted without Tier 2 review (take, for example, a project that includes a permitted use, a structure that meets density and height standards and three [3] "discouraged" design elements. The Planning Commission may approve, approve with conditions or deny the "discouraged" design elements. The Planning Commission may not deny the project itself or any portion of the project that meets all applicable standards of this Article.). The intent of this limited scope of review is to provide, to the maximum extent possible, certainty within the review process. 
(5)  Planning Commission review criteria. The Planning Commission shall review the application pursuant to the criteria listed in Section 16-5-280 of this Chapter and the following: 
a.  The project is consistent with the 2008 Downtown Master Plan and the Comprehensive Plan. 
b.  The project contributes to the City's goal of enhancing the Central Business District as a vibrant, pedestrian-oriented and mixed-use environment as described in Section 16-18-20 of this Article. 
c.  The project will not impede the development and improvement of surrounding property in the manner intended by this Article.

Sec. 16-18-1250. - Downtown Development Authority meeting. 
(a)  Applicability. Applicants submitting applications subject to a Tier 1 level of review are strongly encouraged, but not required, to have a meeting with the Downtown Development Authority (DDA) prior to the submittal of an application. Applicants submitting applications subject to a Tier 2 level of review are required to meet with the DDA following the preapplication conference, but prior to the submittal of an application. 
(b)  Purpose. The general purpose of a DDA meeting is to improve communication between applicants, the public and the DDA. These meetings provide an opportunity for the public to gain a better understanding of the project and for the applicant to receive feedback on a proposed project in advance of submitting a formal application. The goal is to produce a project that better meets the needs and desires of both the applicant and the community. 
(c)  Meeting time and location. Applicants shall notify the DDA of the need to arrange a meeting. Upon notification, the DDA shall have thirty (30) calendar days to establish and hold a meeting on a mutually agreed upon date and time. The meeting shall be held no more than six (6) months and no less than five (5) days prior to the submittal of an application for a development permit. 
(d)  Public notice. The DDA shall be responsible for issuing public notice of the meeting. 
(e)  Meeting content and conduct. At the meeting, the applicant shall present proposed development plans, describe projected impacts of development, describe plans to mitigate impacts as applicable and facilitate a discussion with members of the DDA and the public. The format and conduct of the presentation and discussion shall be determined solely by the applicant so long as all attendees are given an opportunity to comment both orally and in writing consistent with the purpose and objectives in having such meetings as stated herein. City staff participation shall be limited to observation and information gathering. Staff also may provide information on relevant regulatory requirements, as needed. Staff's role shall not be to organize, control or direct the meeting. Staff shall not present, evaluate or pass judgment on the merits of development proposals at DDA meetings. 
(f)  Meeting summary. Along with all other required application materials, the applicant shall submit: a list of names and addresses of those who attended the DDA meeting; a written summary of comments received at the meeting; and a written response of how the applicant has or will address the comments, if at all. While it is hoped and intended that input from the DDA and the public will result in revisions/refinement to a project that are mutually beneficial to the applicant and the public, comments from the DDA and the public are strictly advisory to the applicant and City decision makers. (Ord. 11 §15, 2011) 
Sec. 16-18-1260. - Criteria for review of discouraged land uses. 
    Projects involving the establishment of any land use designated as "discouraged" in Table 16-18-1010 of this Article shall be reviewed based on the following criteria. 
(1)  Are preferred uses reasonably available for the site instead of the discouraged use? 
(2)  The establishment, maintenance or operation of the discouraged use will not create a nuisance for neighboring uses or substantially reduce the values of other property (elements under consideration include buildings, outdoor storage areas and equipment, utility structures and mechanical equipment, building and paving coverage, vehicular and pedestrian access and circulation, vehicular parking and loading, landscaping and screening, lighting, glare, dust, signage, views, noise, odors, noxious emissions and other conditions not typical of land uses in the same zoning sub-district).

ARTICLE XV - Street Naming and Property Numbering 

Sec. 18-15-10. - Designation of street type. 
    Street type designations should be consistent with the road's functional classification, expected traffic use, width of right-of-way and continuity. In order to achieve some consistency of name usage, the following definitions and guidelines are adopted, with acceptable abbreviations. Roads and streets are sometimes ranked by size and function and, accordingly, are assigned a suffix. The following definitions have been applied throughout the United States and should be used when establishing new names. All street names shall have one (1) of the identified suffixes. 
(1)  Street types. 
a.  Road, street, avenue: minor local thoroughfare that is frequently used and carries heavy traffic. 
1.  These can be considered a secondary facility connecting with a federal or state primary highway. 
2.  Continuous curvilinear streets running in one (1) general direction shall be designated as a street or avenue, based upon the most continuous direction. 
b.  Court: A minor street, often a cul-de-sac, generally less than five hundred (500) feet long, ending in a turnabout. Also, short horseshoe-shaped streets. 
c.  Drive: A thoroughfare generally longer than one thousand (1,000) feet. A road that meanders and continues through another right-of-way. 
d.  Boulevard, parkway: A wide thoroughfare with a median reflecting boulevard character, usually with trees or shrubbery in the center median. 
e.  Lane, place: A reduced right-of-way generally less than one thousand (1,000) feet. 
f.  Loop, circle: A circular or semicircular road. A circle can be a street that returns to itself. A loop can be a short drive that begins and ends on the same street or road. A circle is usually longer than a loop and can be a secondary road that begins and circles back to terminate on the same road. 
g.  Way, trail: A dead-end right-of-way generally less than one thousand (1,000) feet long. A minor street that changes direction or begins and ends on the same thoroughfare that is generally a private but sometimes public road. 
h.  Highway, bypass, turnpike: Designated state or federal primary road. 
i.  Interstate, freeway, expressway: A road of the highest order with limited access. 
(2)  All streets and avenues that are in the same relative position within the City, although not connected, should have the same name if a logical extension of the street exists. 
a.  Logical connection shall be determined by the Planning and Development Director. The determination of logical extensions shall consider major topographic features (i.e., the Colorado River, steep bluffs), large-scale land uses (i.e., the high school, the airport), and existing street patterns. 
b.  Street names shall not be extended across the Colorado River unless connected by a bridge. 
(3)  Baseline streets north of the Colorado River shall be First Street and Railroad Avenue. 
a.  First Street shall constitute the base line for the naming of all east-west oriented streets north of the Colorado River. Beginning with First Street and progressing north, all streets shall be named numerically by consecutive numbers as long as they follow the general grid pattern established by downtown Rifle. If the streets are in a new subdivision which have patterns unrelated to the downtown grid pattern and if no logical extension between the streets exists, the streets can be named without reference to the numeric system. In this case, they can also be designated as a road . See Paragraph (2) above regarding logical extensions. 
b.  Railroad Avenue shall divide all streets running east and west north of the Colorado River. 
1.  If a street crosses Railroad Avenue or shows evidence that a logical extension could be made in the future that would connect a street across Railroad Avenue, all that portion of any and all such streets lying east of Railroad Avenue shall be known by its name with the word "East" prefixed thereto, and all that portion of any and all such streets lying west of Railroad Avenue shall be known by its name and the word "West" prefixed thereto. See Paragraph (2) above regarding logical extensions. 
2.  If a street lies on only one (1) side of Railroad Avenue and no logical extension is determined for the future, then the prefix "East" or "West" is not required. See Paragraph (2) above regarding logical extensions. 
(4)  The north-south baseline street south of the Colorado River shall be Taugenbaugh Boulevard for the purpose of distinguishing streets "East" or "West." Because numbered streets shall not be utilized, no east-west baseline is necessary for street naming south of the river. 
a.  If a street crosses Taugenbaugh Boulevard or shows evidence that a logical extension could be made in the future that would connect a street across Taugenbaugh Boulevard, all that portion of any and all such streets lying east of Taugenbaugh Boulevard shall be known by its name with the word "East" prefixed thereto, and all that portion of any and all such streets lying west of Taugenbaugh Boulevard shall be known by its name and the word "West" prefixed thereto. See Paragraph (2) above regarding logical extensions. 
b.  If a street lies on only one (1) side of Taugenbaugh Boulevard and no logical extension is determined for the future, then the prefix "East" or "West" is not required. See Paragraph (2) above regarding logical extensions. 
(5)  Streets extending east and west generally shall be designated as "Streets." 
(6)  Streets extending north and south generally shall be designated as "Avenues." 
(7)  Streets that do not fit into the definition of street or avenue shall be designated as something other than a street or avenue as determined by the street types and definitions in Paragraph (1) above. 
(8)  The abbreviations for street suffixes shall be as follows: 
Ave for Avenue Blvd for Boulevard Byp for Bypass Cir for Circle Ct for Court Dr for Drive Expy for Expressway Fwy for Freeway Hwy for Highway Ln for Lane Loop for Loop Pkwy for Parkway Pl for Place Rd for Road St for Street Trl for Trail Tpk for Turnpike Way for Way  
(9)  Alleys shall not be named. 
(10)  For the purposes of addressing property identification, any property with multiple street frontages shall use the street name from which it maintains primary access. 
(Ord. 31, 2003 §2; Ord. 4 §1, 2005; Ord. 31 §4, 2006) 
Sec. 18-15-20. - Street naming. 
(a)  Developers of new developments may: (1) submit street names; (2) request that the City choose street names; or (3) choose from a pre-assigned list of acceptable or recommended names maintained by the City. Final approval of appropriate names shall be made by the Planning and Development Director. Special circumstances may require the City to name or rename streets without developer input. 
(b)  The following guidelines shall be followed when naming public or private streets in the City: 
(1)  Street names shall be unique and not repeated, with the exception of continuation of existing streets and logical extensions as determined by the Planning and Development Director. See Subsection 18-15-10(2) above regarding logical extensions. 
(2)  Street names shall not be longer than two (2) words, not including the suffix. 
(3)  When a subdivision creates multiple streets, a general theme shall be used for all street names in that subdivision. 
(4)  Any time that a street makes a directional change of approximately ninety (90) degrees, the street name shall change. A directional change of approximately ninety (90) degrees shall mean a horizontal curve where a reduction in the design speed is required (i.e., a sharp turn vs. a sweeping curve). 
(5)  Continuous streets shall have continuous names and shall continue across intersections and through roundabouts. Names shall not change except at the City limits; however, names are not required to change at the City limits. 
(6)  Within the City limits, streets shall use City names, not county road numbers. 
(7)  Street names shall not contain any punctuation or special characters. Only alphabetical symbols A through Z, numbers 0 through 9 and blank spaces may be used in street names. 
(8)  Homonyms, proper names of living people, vulgar words or derogatory terms shall not be used for street names. 
(9)  Cardinal directions shall not be used in the name. Directions are used only to designate the portion of an existing road. 
(Not acceptable - North Road, East Fort Road, Northstar Drive.) 
(10)  Street names shall be of the commonly acceptable spelling, according to a standard dictionary. 
(11)  Street names shall be simple to pronounce, as determined by the Planning and Development Director. 
(12)  Exceptions to these standards may be granted by the Planning and Development Director. 
(13)  Changes to existing street names shall be approved by the City Council. 
(Ord. 31, 2003 §2; Ord. 4 §1, 2005; Ord. 31 §4, 2006) 
Sec. 18-15-30. - Property numbering. 
(a)  Purpose. All developed property within the City limits shall be assigned a property number that is consistent with the adopted City standard outlined in this Section. Numbers will be used for addressing and property identification. These numbers shall progress along streets in a logical, consecutive and clear manner. All attempts shall be made to reduce confusion for property identification purposes. 
(b)  Number required. All buildings within the City limits shall display a City-assigned number, placed on the building at time of construction and maintained throughout the existence of the structure. All property previously maintaining a County-assigned address shall adopt a City-assigned number at the time of annexation to the City. 
(c)  Style of number. The numbers shall be clear, legible, at least five (5) inches in height and placed upon the building as to designate the front entrance of the building. If the entrance of the building does not face the street, the numbers shall be placed on the side of the building facing the street on the side of the building closest to the entrance of the building. The numbers shall be in a conspicuous place and not obscured so that they can be read easily from the center of the street in the daytime. In addition, numbers shall be a contrasting color to the building in order to promote visibility at night. 
(d)  Violations. If the owner or lessee of any building shall fail, refuse or neglect to place the number, or replace it when necessary, such owner or occupant shall be deemed guilty of a Class B misdemeanor offense. Such person shall have ten (10) days to comply or otherwise shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for each subsequent day that the violation is committed or continued. Said offense shall be deemed to be one of strict liability. 
(Ord. 31, 2003 §2; Ord. 31 §4, 2006) 
Sec. 18-15-40. - Assignment of property numbers. 
(a)  The Planning and Development Director shall assign the proper number to any lot or building that will be constructed. Street number assignments shall be made when a building permit application is made. 
(b)  No changes shall be made to assigned building numbers unless it is demonstrated that a conflict exists. Conflicts are at the discretion of the Planning and Development Director, who shall determine if the conflict warrants the assignment of a new number. Numbers shall be assigned or reassigned only by the Planning and Development Director. 
(c)  Insofar as it is practicable, the City shall maintain a list of assigned property numbers and provide these numbers to emergency and utility services upon request. 
(Ord. 31, 2003 §2; Ord. 4 §1, 2005; Ord. 31 §4, 2006) 
Sec. 18-15-50. - Numbering system. 
    The City has a variety of street patterns, types of land use and densities of development. Therefore, the roadway network and development trends in each area must be carefully studied to determine the most appropriate property numbers. At times, this may require the use of different methods to assign numbers. In order to provide a basic framework for consistency in making these decisions, the following numbering standards shall be used: 
(1)  System of numbering. The block system using whole numbers shall be used and one hundred (100) numbers shall be assigned to each block. Each block shall be approximately four hundred (400) feet long. Where there is no intersecting street or avenue or the block is odd-sized, another one hundred (100) numbers shall be assigned to correspond with the numbers in the standard sized block in the area, insofar as it may be practical. 
(2)  Numbering streets. 
a.  For the purpose of numbering the lots and buildings on all streets running east and west, the base shall be as follows: 
1.  North of the Colorado River, the base shall be Railroad Avenue 
2.  South of the Colorado River, the base shall be Taugenbaugh Boulevard as extended. 
b.  Beginning with the number 101 of the northeast comer of all blocks lying west of the base lines as set forth above, numbering to the west, odd numbers shall be assigned to the south side and even numbers to the north side of all streets. Numbers shall continue consecutively until another street or avenue is reached, when the numbers shall commence with the next 101. The numbering shall continue for the entire length of each street west, except as provided in Paragraph (1) above. 
c.  Beginning with the number 101 on the northwest comer of all blocks lying east of the base lines as set forth herein, numbering to the east, the odd numbers shall be on the south side and even numbers on the north side of all such streets. The numbers shall continue consecutively until another street or avenue is reached, when the numbers shall commence with the next 101. The numbering shall continue for the entire length of each street east, except as provided in Paragraph (1) above. 
(3)  Numbering avenues. For the purpose of numbering the lots or building on all avenues running north and south, First Street shall be used as a baseline. Beginning with the number 101 on the southeast corner of all blocks on the north side of First Street, numbering to the north, the odd numbers shall be on the west side and the even numbers on the east side of all such avenues. The numbers shall continue consecutively until another street is reached, when the numbers shall again commence with the next 101. The numbering shall continue for the entire length of each avenue, or until the next block begins as defined by Paragraph (1) above. 
(4)  Multi-addressed buildings. Buildings such as offices or apartments that require several addresses per building shall be addressed one (1) property address, and each unit within shall be given a suite or apartment number. 
(5)  Multi-family units. Multi-story units shall fall in line with the numbering system. The first story shall be addressed first, the second story next, and the numbers shall commence with the next property. 
(6)  Determining street orientation. As defined in Subsection 18-15-10(1) above, streets and avenues are designated based on their most continuous direction and, using the block system, shall be addressed as such. 
(7)  Multiple frontages. Lots that have more than one (1) frontage shall be addressed during the building permit application process to determine the proper frontage. Addresses to multiple frontage lots will be issued after the Planning Department has approved a frontage. 
(8)  Addressing at annexation. For the purposes of addressing, when the City annexes a section of road previously in the County, the City shall re-number the properties and structures along this road. 
(Ord. 31, 2003 §2; Ord. 4 §1, 2005; Ord. 31 §4, 2006)

(iii)  The "appointment window" alternatives for installations, service calls and other installation activities will be either a specific time or, at maximum, a four-hour time block during normal business hours.

(iv)  An operator may not cancel an appointment with a customer after the close of business on the business day prior to the scheduled appointment. 
(v)  If a cable operator representative is running late for an appointment with a customer and will not be able to keep the appointment as scheduled, the customer will be contacted. The appointment will be rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which is convenient for the customer. 
(3)  Communications between cable operators and cable subscribers-
