PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Dover, Delaware. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Code, as supplemented through November 24, 2003, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1981 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 RELATED LAWS RL:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE RLCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER AND RELATED LAWS INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Senior Code Attorney, and Leesa Hampton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Anthony J. DePrima, City Manager, Mr. Nicholas H. Rodriguez, City Solicitor, Ms. Janice C. Green, City Clerk/Alderman, and Mr. James J. Galvin, Jr., Inspections Director/Planner, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER AND RELATED LAWS[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- This part contains the city's Charter and other state laws which relate only to the City of Dover. In the preparation of this part, the following editorial changes have been made: 
(1) A uniform system of capitalization, spelling of numbers and citations to state statutes has been used. 
(2) Misspelled words have been corrected. 
Subpart A contains the city's Charter, being Senate Bill 126, adopted July 12, 2005. 
Subpart B contains acts which do not amend the city's Charter, but which relate only to The City of Dover. These acts have been placed in the most logical order possible and arbitrary section numbers have been assigned to them. In each case, however, the derivation of the act is stated in the history note. Also included in subpart B is a listing of those acts which relate only to the city, the printing of which has been deemed inadvisable.

    The City may, from time to time, extend its boundaries in accordance with Title 22, Chapter 1, Section 101 (22 Del. C. §101) through the following annexation processes: 
(1)  In the case where annexation is petitioned by all owners of all property considered for annexation, no election shall be required. 
For an annexation petition not requiring an election, such petition shall be processed in accordance with procedures established for amendments to the zoning map, specified in Dover Code, Appendix B - Zoning. All annexation petitions shall be processed concurrently with the rezoning of the property considered for annexation and shall be subject to public hearing before City Council. Public notice shall be completed in accordance with the provisions of the Dover Code relating to amendment of the zoning map. 
(2)  In the case where annexation is not petitioned by all owners of all property considered for annexation, such annexation shall be subject to an election, as follows: 
(a)  In order to extend the boundaries of The City of Dover the council shall adopt a resolution proposing the inclusion of all property considered for annexation within the limits of The City of Dover and calling for a special election to be held not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days after the adoption of the resolution, in accordance with Title 22, Chapter 1, Section 101, Delaware Code. The resolution shall contain a description of all property considered for annexation, the date of the election, and the place or places of said election. The resolution shall be published in at least two (2) issues of a newspaper of general circulation within the City of Dover at least two (2) weeks prior to the day of said election. 
(b)  The annexation election shall be held by the city's election officers. Each owner of the property considered for annexation shall be entitled to one (1) vote. Owners of real estate in common shall be entitled to one (1) vote each. Life tenants shall be entitled to one (1) vote each but the holders of the remainder interest or similar interest subject to the life estate shall not be entitled to vote. Corporations, firms or associations shall be entitled to one (1) vote, the same as private persons. 
More than one (1) annexation election may be held on the same day; however, the elections shall be separate. 
The Council of the City of Dover shall provide the ballots and shall bear the cost of holding such annexation elections. The ballots shall briefly indicate the property proposed for annexation and shall provide two (2) boxes on the ballot beside which shall appear the words "FOR inclusion within The City of Dover," and "AGAINST inclusion within The City of Dover." Each voter shall indicate their preference by making a mark within the box beside the words expressing their preference. 
For the annexation election, the polls shall open at 11:00 a.m. to and remain open until each eligible voter has cast their vote or until 8:00 p.m., whichever occurs first. When the polls are closed the election officers shall publicly count the votes and forthwith certify to the clerk of the council the number of votes cast for and against inclusion within the city limits. At the next regular or special meeting of the council the mayor and council shall receive the results of the election and make the same a part of the minutes of said meeting. 
If a majority of the votes cast in an annexation election are in favor of the inclusion of that property, the council may thereupon adopt a resolution annexing said property and including same within the limits of The City of Dover. Upon the adoption of a resolution of annexation a copy thereof certified by the clerk of council and a plot of the area annexed shall be forthwith filed for record with the Recorder of Deeds of Kent County, and the area so annexed shall for all purposes thenceforth be part of The City of Dover. 
If a majority of the votes cast in an annexation election shall be against the inclusion of that property within the limits of The City of Dover, the proposed annexation of said property shall be declared to have failed. Nothing in this Charter shall prohibit the council from resubmitting a proposal for annexation to the eligible voters for said property, or any portion thereof, under the authority of this section and in accordance with the provisions thereof. 77 Del.

The amount so borrowed shall be paid back out of current revenue received thereafter. 
To exercise the power aforesaid the council shall adopt a resolution to that effect, which resolution shall require the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of all the members of the council, and the approval of the mayor. The indebtedness created under this section shall be evidenced by the bond, or note, of the city, and the faith and credit of the city shall be deemed to be pledged thereby. 
(b)  The mayor and council is hereby authorized and empowered to borrow from time to time on the faith and credit of The City of Dover sums of money for such purposes as may be deemed necessary and proper by the mayor and council of the said city which purpose shall be consistent with the powers conferred upon the mayor and council of The City of Dover by the Charter thereof, as amended, for the management and maintenance of the said city and for these purposes the mayor and council shall have full power and authority to issue bonds of the said "The City of Dover." 
    The aggregate of the amounts so borrowed together with all other bonded indebtedness for which the full faith and credit of the City of Dover has been pledged shall not at any time exceed a sum equal to 5 percent of the total assessed value of real property situate within the bounds of the City of Dover as such boundaries shall from time to time appear. 
    The said bonds shall be issued in one or more series, shall bear such date or dates, shall mature at such time or times, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, shall be payable at such time or times, and at such place or places, shall be in such denominations, and shall contain such other provisions as the mayor and council may provide and shall be set forth in the said bonds. Said bonds may or may not be coupon bonds and may be registered or otherwise as the mayor and council deem advisable. 
    The mayor and council shall direct and effect the preparation and sale of said bonds at such time or times, at such price or prices, and upon such terms as the said mayor and council deem advisable, and all the monies arising from the sale of said bonds shall be used for the municipal purposes of The City of Dover specified in the resolution authorizing their issue.

Taxes for interest and for redemption of said bonds shall be levied and raised as taxes for general municipal purposes in the said city are levied and raised and shall be in addition to those levied and raised for any and all other municipal purposes. A statement appearing in the bonds issued under the provisions of this section to the effect that the bonds have been duly authorized shall be deemed and held to be conclusive evidence in favor of the lawful holder of any such bonds that the terms and conditions of this section have been fully met and complied with. 
(c)  Bonds may be authorized and issued pursuant to subsection (b), without a referendum vote, by a resolution of the council which shall have the affirmative vote of three-fourths of the members thereof and the approval of the mayor, for the following purposes:

(ii)  to refund bonds secured by the city's full faith and credit, prior to their stated maturity, provided that (A) the present value of the aggregate principal and interest payments of the refunding bonds are not greater than the present value of the aggregate principal and interest payments on the bonds to be refunded determined by discounting at the effective interest rate on the refunding bonds, calculated based on the internal rate of return: and (B) at the time of issuance of the refunding bonds there are deposited in escrow, pledged to secure the refunded bonds, sufficient monies and/or direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed by, the United States government, which, without regard to any reinvestment earnings, will be sufficient to pay when due all interest, principal and redemption price on the refunded bonds at maturity or upon earlier call for redemption. 
(d)  Except for bonds issued pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, all bonds issued under the provisions of subsection (b) shall first be approved by a referendum vote of the qualified voters (as herein defined) of The City of Dover.

    The mayor and council shall at the next regular meeting after the election, or at a special meeting, receive the results of the referendum election and make the same a part of the minutes of said meeting, whereupon if a majority of the votes cast were for the bond issue bonds herein provided for may be issued and sold as provided in subsection (b), but if at such referendum election the majority of the votes cast were against the bond issue, then no bonds shall be issued nor shall any money be borrowed pursuant to the resolution submitted to the referendum. 
(e)  In addition to the power otherwise granted in this section, the mayor and council may issue special assessment revenue bonds to finance those public projects for which the city may levy and collect special assessments pursuant to Section 28 of this Charter. Such bonds shall not obligate the faith and credit of the city, but shall be payable solely from the proceeds of the special assessments which are pledged to the payment thereof. Such bonds shall be authorized without a referendum vote by a resolution of the council which shall have the affirmative vote of three-fourths of the members thereof and the approval of the mayor. 
(f)  After authorization of the sale of bonds as provided in this section and in anticipation of the sale and issuance of said bonds, the mayor and council may borrow money and issue notes of the city for the purpose and to the extent of the amount of bonds authorized to be sold, less the amount of any bonds theretofore issued under such authority. The said borrowing shall be authorized by a resolution of the council which shall have the affirmative vote of three-fourths of the members thereof and the approval of the mayor, and the note or notes thereby authorized shall be signed by the mayor and treasurer of the city. When issued and signed in accordance with this subsection (f), the faith and credit of the city shall be deemed to be pledged for the repayment of all said notes, except those issued pursuant to subsection (e) hereof. 
    The note or notes issued in anticipation of a bond issue may be renewed from time to time, but the proceeds of the sale of such bonds shall, to the extent necessary, be first used to pay and retire such notes. Said notes may be redeemed at par and accrued interest at any time prior to their maturity if the right so to do shall have been reserved. 
(g)  For the purposes of the debt limitations prescribed in this section, (i) any bonds which have been refunded pursuant to subsection (c)(ii) shall be treated as no longer outstanding; and (ii) bonded indebtedness, principal amount of bonds and bonds outstanding shall be determined without regard to original issue discount. 77 Del.

(Code 1981, § 1-5) 
Sec. 1-16. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council.

(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles;

(4)  Change the term "this ordinance," or terms of the same meaning, to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____," inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code that embody the substantive sections of the ordinances incorporated into the Code; and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier may any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-17. - General penalty; separate offenses; unpaid fines. 
    Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the city any act or omission is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or a violation, or whenever in said Code or ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful or a violation, and no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of this Code or any ordinance shall be punishable as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. Unless specifically provided otherwise, or the context thereof so dictates, each day any violation of any provision of this Code or any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.

In addition to the right of representation provided in subsection (a) of this section, the mayor, councilmembers and employees who, but for the application of any provision of the constitutions or laws of the United States or the state to the contrary, would be entitled to immunity in accordance with 10 Del. C. § 4010 et seq., shall be indemnified by the city against any expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, judgments, fines and costs, actually and reasonably incurred by said person in defending against the action, suit or proceeding giving rise thereto; provided, however, if the person seeking indemnification chooses to retain his own attorney rather than use the city solicitor, he shall be responsible to bear all costs incurred thereby.

If, for whatever reason, including a settlement agreed upon by the parties, the court or administrative tribunal having jurisdiction shall fail or refuse to make the determination required by this subsection, then the indemnification shall only be granted as to the person upon the affirmative recommendation of a majority of members elected to the council.

(c)  Costs of conveyance. Unless otherwise specified by the city council, all fees and costs, legal or otherwise, associated with the sale and conveyance of all excess lands shall be paid by the purchaser.

a.  Determine if disposal of the parcel is in the city's best interests. 
b.  Determine if disposal by sale, gift, or some other means would best serve the city's interests.

(e)  Exceptions to standard method of disposition. 
(1)  Exception A-Sale to an abutting owner. When, in the opinion of city council, a public sale would be detrimental to the lands of an abutter, and/or that a public sale would place the abutter at undue risk; or that the combination of abutter's land and city's land would be substantially greater in value than that of the sum of the parcels considered individually, city council may direct the city assessor to have prepared one or more unbiased fee appraisals of the parcel. Thereafter, the subject land will be offered for sale to the said abutter at the appraisal price, plus the appraisal fees, plus the legal costs. In the event the offer is not accepted, a public sale may be ordered. 
Examples of detrimental affect might be when the surplus city parcel lies between an abutting property and the street and development of the parcel would obstruct visibility of the abutter's property, or when the surplus parcel is zoned multi-family and abuts a single-family parcel. 
(2)  Exception B-Trade of lands. Trade of lands may be approved when it is shown beyond doubt that such a trade will be equal to or better than the lands to be traded either on a "square foot for square foot" measure and/or on a "dollar for dollar" measure. 
(3)  Exception C-Conveyance of odd shaped and/or unbuildable parcels. City acquisitions for roads, utility usages, etc. may, after such usage is accomplished, leave a small strip of land that is odd shaped and unbuildable. City council may approve the conveyance of this strip of land to an abutting property owner on request of said owner. The price for these lands shall be at the same cost basis as that paid by the city. If conveyance is made in excess of two years after the date of city acquisition, then the consideration shall either be based on a price established by an unbiased fee appraisal made on the basis of the value added to the abutting property by the acquisition of said lands, or on the city's cost basis for the parcel adjusted for inflation, whichever city council shall select. All fees, legal or otherwise, associated with the conveyance are to be paid by the purchaser. 
(4)  Exception D-Sale of small or irregular shaped lot to an abutting owner. If any excess parcel of land is too small or irregular in shape to be of any value to anyone other than an abutting owner, it may be sold to such owner at either its fee appraised fair market value, or at its fair market value as established by the city's assessment records, whichever city council shall select. The costs of the appraisal and all legal costs shall be paid by the owner requesting the conveyance. 
(5)  Exception E-Donation of land to non-profit organizations. If, in the opinion of city council, the donation of a parcel of excess land to a non-profit organization would be in the best interest of the city, council then reserves unto itself the right to make such donation.

Former ch. 30 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the Code of 1981; an Ord. adopted July 13, 1998; and Ord. No. 2010-23, adopted August 23, 2010. 

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 30-1. - Applicability. 
    This chapter shall be applicable to all elected and appointed officials and all employees of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2017-14 , 12-11-2017) 
Sec. 30-2. - Statement of intent and purpose. 
(a)  Intent. The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial, and responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policies be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public has confidence in the integrity of its government. It is the intent of the city that all elected and appointed officials and all employees of the city adhere to high levels of ethical conduct, honesty, integrity and accountability to assure that the public has confidence in all aspects of city government and the city officials that exercise discretionary powers. These standards of ethical conduct are intended to uphold the public trust in the persons in positions of public responsibility who are acting for the benefit of the public. All elected and appointed officials and all employees of the city shall comply with both the letter and the spirit of the standards of ethical conduct and strive to avoid situations that create impropriety or the appearance of impropriety. The standards define and discourage certain actions that may create impropriety or the appearance of impropriety that undermine public trust in elected and appointed public officials and employees. 
(b)  Purpose . The standards of ethical conduct should promote public confidence in the integrity of city officials; state principles of conduct and ethics which are to be applied in public service; inform the public of the standards to which their city officials are expected to adhere; and help motivate city officials and public employees to pursue productive conduct and ethical ideals which exceed minimum standards. The city council finds and declares as matters of public policy goals and objectives for all city employees and elected and appointed officials, the following: 
(1)  Public trust. In our democratic form of government, the conduct of officials and employees of the city must hold the respect and confidence of the people. They must, therefore, avoid conduct which is in violation of their public trust or which creates a justifiable impression among the public that such trust is being violated. 
(2)  Standards. To ensure propriety and to preserve public confidence, officials and employees of the city must have the benefit of specific standards to guide their conduct and disciplinary mechanisms to guarantee uniform maintenance of those standards. Some standards of this type are so vital to government that violation thereof should subject the violator to criminal penalties. 
(3)  Public service. In our democratic form of government, it is both necessary and desirable that all citizens should be encouraged to assume public office and employment, and that, therefore, the activities of officials and employees of the city should not be unduly circumscribed. 
(4)  Performance of duty. Elected city officials are obligated to uphold the fundamental legal principles of our system of government, as set forth in the United States Constitution, the state constitution, and the city Charter, as well as all applicable provisions of federal, state and local law and court decisions. They are bound to do so, and the failure to so act shall constitute malfeasance in office. 
(5)  Fairness. City officials and employees shall strive for the highest standard of fairness in all of their activities and shall not grant any special consideration, treatment, or advantage to any citizen beyond that which is available to every other citizen. 
(6)  Use of private information. In the course of their official responsibilities, city officials and employees are often privy to categories of information which are of a private nature and are legally protected from public disclosure. City officials and employees shall maintain the privacy of such information, and they shall not take advantage of such information for personal gain, or the personal gain of friends or family. 
(Ord. No. 2017-14 , 12-11-2017) 
Sec. 30-3. - Acknowledgment of policies; required disclosures, and required annual training. 
    In order for the mayor, councilmembers, mayoral and council appointees, and city employees to better serve the constituents of the city in an open, transparent fashion and to further be held accountable, the following actions shall be taken by each of the designated persons: 
(a)  Acknowledgment of policies . Each elected and appointed official and all city employees shall be furnished copies of Chapter 30-Standards of Ethical Conduct and Ethics Commission, either electronically or, if requested, in hard copy, before entering upon the duties of their office or employment and shall sign a written acknowledgment of receipt of the copy. The documents shall be read, reviewed, and signed by all appointees by the time of their appointment or re-appointment. 
(b)  Financial disclosure report. Any city employee or elected or appointed official who has a financial interest in any private enterprise which is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of, or does business with, any city agency (and any city official who has a financial interest in any private enterprise which is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of, or does business with, the city agency on which he serves as an appointee) shall file a financial disclosure report with the ethics commission fully disclosing the same. Such disclosure shall be confidential and the ethics commission shall not release such disclosed information, except as may be necessary for the enforcement of this chapter. The filing of such financial disclosure report shall be a condition of commencing and continuing employment or appointed status with the city. The financial disclosure report shall be submitted by August 1 of each calendar year. 
(c)  Disclosure of interest in legislation. 
(1)  A councilman who has a financial or other private interest in any legislation shall disclose on the records of the council or other appropriate authority the nature and extent of such interest. This provision shall not apply if the councilman disqualifies himself from voting on such legislation. 
(2)  Any other city official or employee who has a financial or other private interest in any legislation and who participates in discussion with or gives an official opinion to the council shall disclose on the records of the council or other appropriate authority the nature and extent of such interest. 
(3)  Any city employee or city officer who has a financial interest in any private enterprise which is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of, or does business with, any city agency, shall file with the ethics commission a written statement fully disclosing the same. Such disclosure shall be confidential and the ethics commission shall not release such disclosed information, except as may be necessary for the enforcement of this subchapter. The filing of such disclosure statement shall be a condition of commencing and continuing employment or appointed status with the city. 
(4)  Required annual training . All city employees and elected and appointed officials shall undergo and receive annual training on the city's ethics policies and procedures.

ARTICLE II. - STANDARDS OF ETHICAL CONDUCT. 

Sec. 30-20. - Established. 
    High ethical standards among public officials and employees are essential to gain and maintain the confidence of the people, because such confidence is essential to the conduct of free government. Public officials and employees are agents of the people and hold office for the benefit of the public. They are bound to observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully and impartially the duties of their offices, regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their primary concern. Their conduct in both their official and private affairs should be above reproach. These standards of ethical conduct are adopted in order to secure this desired high level of public trust, ensure the impartiality of public officials and employees, and impose standards of accountability. 
(a)  General responsibilities of officials and employees. 
(1)  Officials and employees have the common obligation of serving the public. In performing their duties, they shall treat the public and each other with respect, concern, and responsiveness, recognizing that their common goal of exceptional public service can only be achieved by working together. Disputes that arise among public servants shall be resolved at the lowest possible level; keeping in mind that public money spent on resolving these disputes is money not spent on important public needs. 
(2)  Officials and employees shall treat their position as a public trust, with a fiduciary duty to use the powers and resources of public office only to advance the public interest and not to obtain personal benefits or pursue private interests. 
(3)  Officials and employees shall conduct themselves in a manner that justifies the confidence placed in them by the people, at all times maintaining the integrity and discharging ethically the high responsibilities of public service. 
(4)  Full disclosure of real or potential conflicts of interest shall be a guiding principle for determining appropriate conduct. At all times, reasonable efforts shall be made to avoid undue influence and abuse of office in public service. 
(5)  No official or employee may request or receive, and no person may offer any money, thing of value or promise thereof, other than any city pay received, that is conditioned upon or given in exchange for promised performance of an official act. 
(b)  Appearance of violation. Each city employee and official shall endeavor to pursue a course of conduct which will not raise suspicion among the public that he is engaging in acts which are in violation of his public trust and which will not reflect unfavorably upon the city and its government. 
(c)  Private interest; gifts. No city employee or official shall have any interest in any private enterprise, nor shall he incur any obligation of any nature which is in substantial conflict with the proper performance of his duties in the public interest. No city employee or official shall accept other employment, any compensation, gift, payment of expenses or any other thing of monetary value under circumstances in which such acceptance may result in any of the following: 
(1)  Impairment of independence of judgment in the exercise of official duties; 
(2)  An undertaking to give preferential treatment to any person; 
(3)  The making of a governmental decision outside official channels; or 
(4)  Any adverse effect on the confidence of the public in the integrity of the government of the city. 
(d)  Interest in private enterprise. No city employee or official shall acquire a financial interest in any private enterprise which he has reason to believe may be directly involved in decisions to be made by him in an official capacity on behalf of the city. 
(e)  Prohibitions relating to conflicts of interest . No councilman or other official or employee, whether paid or unpaid, shall engage in any business or transaction or shall have a financial or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his official duties in the public interest or would tend to impair his independence of judgment or action in the performance of his official duties. Personal as distinguished from financial interest includes an interest arising from blood or marriage relationships or close business or political association provided, that upon request from any person with official responsibility with respect to the matter, any such person who has such a personal or private interest may nevertheless respond to questions concerning any such matter. 
(1)  Restrictions on exercise of official authority. 
a.  Prohibited participation. No city employee or official may participate on behalf of the city in the review or disposition of any matter pending before the city in which he has a personal or private interest, provided that, upon request from any person with official responsibility with respect to the matter, any such person who has such a personal or private interest may nevertheless respond to questions concerning any such matter. A personal or private interest in a matter is an interest which tends to impair a person's independence of judgment in the performance of his duties with respect to that matter. 
b.  Impairment of judgment. A person has an interest which tends to impair his independence of judgment in the performance of his duties with respect to any matter when: 
i.  Any action or inaction with respect to the matter would result in a financial benefit or detriment to accrue to the person or a close relative to a greater extent than such benefit or detriment would accrue to others who are members of the same class or group of persons; or 
ii.  The person or a close relative has a financial interest in a private enterprise which enterprise or interest would be affected by any action or inaction on a matter to a lesser or greater extent than like enterprises or other interests in the same enterprise. 
c.  Statutory responsibility. In any case where a person has a statutory responsibility with respect to action or inaction on any matter where he has a personal or private interest and there is no provision for the delegation of such responsibility to another person, the person may exercise responsibility with respect to such matter, provided that, promptly after becoming aware of such conflict of interest, he files a written statement with the ethics commission, fully disclosing the personal or private interest and explaining why it is not possible to delegate responsibility for the matter to another person. 
(2)  Restrictions on representing another's interest before the city. 
a.  Prohibited. No city employee or official may represent or otherwise assist any private enterprise with respect to any matter before the city. 
b.  Exception. This subsection shall not preclude any city employee or official from appearing before the city or otherwise assisting any private enterprise with respect to any matter in the exercise of his official duties. 
(3)  Restriction on contracting with the city. 
a.  Prohibited. No city employee or official shall benefit from any contract with the city, nor solicit any contract, and shall not enter into any contract with the city (other than an employment contract). 
b.  Ownership of enterprise. No private enterprise in which a city employee or official has a legal or equitable ownership of more than ten percent (more than one percent in the case of a corporation the stock of which is regularly traded on an established securities market) shall enter into any contract with the city (other than an employment contract) unless such contract was made or let after public notice and competitive bidding. 
(f)  Postemployment restrictions. No person who has served as a city employee or official shall represent or otherwise assist any private enterprise on any matter involving the city, for a period of two years after termination of his employment or elected or appointed status with the city, if he gave an opinion, conducted an investigation or otherwise was directly and materially responsible for such matter in the course of his official duties as a city employee or official, nor shall any former city employee or official disclose confidential information gained by reason of his public position, nor shall he otherwise use such information for personal gain or benefit. 
(g)  Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. No person shall disclose any information required to be maintained confidential by the ethics commission under section 30-3(b), 30-73 or 30-74. 
(h)  Abuse of office. 
(1)  Political contributions. No elected city official shall agree to sponsor legislation, or to influence in any manner the formulation or passage of legislation, in exchange for political contributions or promises thereof. 
(2)  Substantial interest. No elected city official shall vote for, or promote in any manner whatsoever, legislation affecting any subject matter in which he has a substantial interest. Any such interest shall be disclosed by said elected official prior to a vote on any such legislation, and said elected official shall vote "abstain" when called upon to vote. 
(3)  Use of city property. No city official or employee shall request or permit the use of city-owned vehicles, equipment, materials, or property for personal convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the public generally or are provided for the use of such official or employee in the conduct of official business as a matter of municipal policy. 
(4)  Personal gain. No city official or employee shall utilize the influence of his office or position for personal pecuniary gain, or to avoid the legal consequences of his personal conduct. 
(i)  Criminal sanctions. 
(1)  Penalties. Any person who knowingly or willfully violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable for each such violation by imprisonment of not more than one year and by a fine as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. 
(2)  Time limitations. A prosecution for a violation of this section shall be subject to the time limitations of 11 Del. C. § 205. 
(j)  Contracts voidable by court action. In addition to any other penalty provided by law, any contract entered into by any city agency in violation of this chapter shall be voidable by the city agency; provided that in determining whether any court action should be taken to void such a contract pursuant to this subsection, the city agency shall consider the interests of innocent third parties who may be damaged thereby. Any court action to void any transaction must be initiated within 30 days after the city agency involved has, or should have, knowledge of such violation. 
(k)  Private gain. No city employee or official shall use his public office to secure unwarranted privileges, private advancement or gain. 
(l)  Confidential information; prohibited activity. No city employee or official shall engage in any activity beyond the scope of his public position which might reasonably be expected to require or induce him to disclose confidential information acquired by him by reason of his public position. 
(m)  Disclosure of information. No city employee or official shall, beyond the scope of his public position, disclose confidential information gained by reason of his public position, nor shall he otherwise use such information for personal gain or benefit. 
(n)  Ex parte communications . No official or employee shall encourage, make or accept any ex parte or other unilateral application or communication that excludes the interests of other parties in a matter under consideration when such application or communication is designed to influence official decision or conduct of the official or other officials, employees or agencies in order to obtain a more favored treatment or special consideration to advance the personal or private interests of himself or herself or others. The purpose of this provision is to guarantee that all interested parties to any matter shall have equal opportunity to express and represent their interests. 
Any written ex parte communication received by an official or employee in matters where all interested parties should have equal opportunity for a hearing shall be made part of the record by the recipient. 
Any oral ex parte communication received under such conditions should be written down in substance by the recipient and also made a part of the record. 
A communication concerning only the status of a pending matter is not regarded as an ex parte communication. 
(o)  Sexual favors. No city employee or official, in the course of his public responsibilities, shall use the granting of sexual favors as a condition, either explicit or implicit, for an individual's favorable treatment by that person or a city agency.

(c)  Chairperson; quorum. The ethics commission shall elect a chairperson from among its membership.

(Ord. No. 2017-14 , 12-11-2017) 
Sec. 30-73. - Rules of procedure; complaints; hearings; dispositions. 
(a)  Any person, either personally or on behalf of an organization or governmental body, may file a sworn complaint for the ethics commission with the city clerk. The complaint must be in writing, be signed, and show the address of the person who submitted it. The complaint must state that, to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable reflection, the information in the complaint is true. The complaint must describe the facts that constitute the violation of the standards of ethical conduct in sufficient detail so that the ethics commission and the person who is the subject of the complaint can reasonably be expected to understand the nature of any offense that is being alleged. The commission may request any additional information deemed necessary to screen the complaint or to render a decision. No complaints shall be accepted or considered which relate to actions that took place more than one year prior to the date of filing. The individual filing the sworn complaint has 60 days from the date that the issue is brought to his or her attention to file a complaint. 
(b)  After the sworn complaint has been filed, none of the parties or their representatives may communicate on an ex parte basis with any commission members pertaining to the complaint. All communications pertaining to the complaint shall be submitted to the city clerk. 
(c)  Within seven days of receiving a sworn complaint the city clerk shall send copies of the complaint to each member of the ethics commission, the city solicitor, and the official or officials against whom such complaint has been filed. Hereinafter, the complaining party shall be referred to as the "complainant" and the official against whom a complaint has been lodged shall be referred to as the "respondent." 
(d)  The commission recognizes that distribution to the public of a sworn complaint prior to screening by the commission as required below could harm the reputation of an innocent person and is contrary to the public interest; therefore, the public release of the complaint is prohibited until the screening process has been completed. The commission shall consult in confidence to screen the complaint within 14 days of receiving the complaint. The commission may immediately dismiss a complaint if: 
(1)  It has no jurisdiction; or 
(2)  The alleged violation, if true, would not constitute a violation of the standards of ethical conduct; or 
(3)  The alleged violation is a minor or de minimis violation; or 
(4)  The complaint is, on its face, frivolous, groundless, or brought for purposes of harassment; or 
(5)  The matter has become moot because the person who is the subject of the complaint is no longer an officer, official or employee; or 
(6)  The respondent had obtained an advisory opinion under section 30-74(c) permitting the conduct; or 
(7)  The appointing authority of the respondent has already taken action as a result of finding a violation and the commission believes the action was appropriate. 
(e)  In issues regarding standards of ethical conduct violations, the enforcement process is intended to be corrective rather than remedial unless the violation is a repeated offense. In the event the ethics commission determines a standards of ethical conduct violation has occurred, and it is minor in nature, with the concurrence of the complainant and the subject of the sworn complaint, the commission may dispense with the hearing process and conduct a more informal mediation process in lieu of a hearing. 
(f)  If the sworn complaint is not dismissed or otherwise resolved pursuant to subsection 30-73(d), the city clerk shall promptly contact the members of the ethics commission, the city solicitor, the complainant, and the respondent in order to ascertain a date and time when a hearing can be convened on such complaint. As soon as a date and time have been agreed upon for a hearing before the ethics commission, the city clerk shall send written notice of such scheduling and a copy of the rules of procedure to the complainant and to the respondent. No copies of the complaint shall be provided to any other parties before the respondent receives the complaint. The city solicitor shall be the prosecuting attorney in all disciplinary proceedings before the ethics commission. In any such investigation or proceeding, a defendant shall be given an opportunity to be heard after notice, to be advised and assisted by legal counsel, to produce witnesses and offer evidence, and to cross examine witnesses. A transcript of any such proceeding shall be made and retained, subject to the confidentiality requirements of this chapter. 
(g)  The commission may dismiss a complaint if the complainant does not appear at the hearing and if, in the opinion of the commission, it would be unfair to the respondent not to have the opportunity to examine the complainant. 
(h)  As promptly as possible after the close of the hearing, the commission shall deliberate to determine if the allegations have been proven by clear and convincing evidence. Only ethics commission members who have been present for the hearing may participate in the deliberations, and any findings and recommendations must be adopted by a majority of the commission. The commission may consider, when making findings and recommendations, the severity of the offense, the presence or absence of any intention to conceal, deceive, or mislead, whether the violation was deliberate, negligent or inadvertent, and whether the incident was isolated or part of a pattern. 
(i)  Within seven days of the conclusion of deliberations, the commission shall issue an order setting forth its findings and recommendations. In the alternative, the commission where it deems it appropriate, may issue an advisory opinion in lieu of making findings and recommendations. 
(j)  If the respondent is an employee, the commission may, if it determines corrective action is necessary, notify the city manager or the council president and recommend that action be taken, including discipline. 
(k)  If the respondent is a city official, the commission may propose actions to the city council that are appropriate to the finding as specified in section 30-73(o). 
(l)  The commission shall send a written copy of its findings and recommendations to the respondent and the complainant. 
(m)  Proceeding relating to member. A member of the ethics commission shall be ineligible to participate, as a member of the ethics commission, in any ethics commission proceeding relating to his conduct. A member of the ethics commission who has been found by the ethics commission to have violated this chapter shall be ineligible to serve again as a member of the ethics commission. 
(n)  Self-disqualification. A member of the ethics commission may disqualify himself from participating in any investigation of the conduct of any person upon submission, in writing and under oath, of an affidavit or disqualification stating that he cannot render an impartial and unbiased decision in the case in which he seeks to disqualify himself.

(1)  Reprimand. Issue a written reprimand or censure of that person's conduct. 
(2)  Discipline. With respect to a city employee, remove, suspend, demote or take other appropriate disciplinary action with respect to that person, without regard to any limits imposed by this chapter, but within the limits of the constitution, the laws of the state, the Charter of the city, and ordinances and existing collective bargaining agreements. 
(3)  Recommend removal. With respect to an appointed official, recommend that appropriate action be taken to remove the official from the appointed position. 
(4)  Recommend fine. With respect to an elected city official, recommend that such official be fined in an amount recommended by the ethics commission. 
(p)  Rights of person charged. In any proceeding before the ethics commission, upon the request of any person charged with a violation of this chapter, such person shall be permitted to inspect, copy or photograph books, papers, documents, photographs or other tangible objects which will be used as evidence against that person in a disciplinary hearing and which are material to the preparation of his defense. 
(q)  Exculpatory information. In any proceeding before the ethics commission, if the city solicitor or ethics commission at any time receives any exculpatory information concerning an alleged violation against any person, it shall forthwith make such information available to such person. 
(r)  Subpoenas. Any person charged with a violation of this chapter may apply to the ethics commission for the issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses and for the production of documents on his behalf. The application shall be granted upon a concise showing by such person that the proposed testimony or evidence is relevant (or is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of relevant evidence) and is not otherwise available. The application shall be denied if not made at a reasonable time or if the testimony or evidence would be merely cumulative. 
(s)  Confidentiality of proceedings.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 50-1. - Findings. 
    The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has identified special flood hazard areas within the boundaries of the City of Dover, Delaware. Special flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. Development that is inadequately elevated, improperly floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
    The City of Dover agreed to meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program and was accepted for participation in the program on September 16, 1982. As of that date or the initial effective date of the City of Dover Flood Insurance Rate Map, all development and new construction as defined herein, are to be compliant with these regulations and the flood load and flood-resistant construction provisions of the building code. 
( Ord. No. 2014-09, 6-9-2014 ) 
Sec. 50-2. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to: 
(1)  Protect human life, health and welfare; 
(2)  Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future; 
(3)  Minimize flooding of water supply and sanitary sewage disposal systems; 
(4)  Maintain natural drainage; 
(5)  Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units and its residents, by discouraging unwise design and construction of development in areas subject to flooding; 
(6)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(7)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(8)  Minimize damage to public facilities and other utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges; 
(9)  Reinforce that those who build in and occupy special flood hazard areas should assume responsibility for their actions; 
(10)  Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and near flood prone areas; 
(11)  Provide that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the floodplain are maintained; 
(12)  Minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(13)  Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally incompatible; and 
(14)  Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 C.F.R. Section 59.22. 
( Ord. No. 2014-09, 6-9-2014 ) 
Sec. 50-3. - Areas to which these regulations apply. 
    These regulations shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Dover, as identified in section 50-4. 
( Ord. No. 2014-09, 6-9-2014 ) 
Sec. 50-4. - Basis for establishing special flood hazard areas. 
    For the purposes of these regulations, and for the purpose of establishing flood hazard areas in the building code [Section 1612.3 and Table R301.2(1)], the following are adopted by reference as a part of these regulations and serve as the basis for establishing special flood hazard areas: 
(1)  The FEMA Flood Insurance Study for Kent County, Delaware and Incorporated Areas dated July 7, 2014 and all subsequent amendments and/or the most recent revision thereof. 
(2)  The FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map for Kent County, Delaware and Incorporated Areas dated July 7, 2014, and all subsequent amendments and/or the most recent revision thereof. 
(3)  Other hydrologic and hydraulic engineering studies and/or maps prepared pursuant to these regulations or for other purposes, and which establish base flood elevations, delineate 100-year floodplains, floodways or other areas of special flood hazard. 
(4)  The City of Dover may identify and regulate new local flood hazard or ponding areas. These areas should be delineated and adopted on a "Local Flood Hazard Map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study methodologies. 
(5)  Where field surveyed topography indicates that ground elevations are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a flood hazard map, the area shall be considered as special flood hazard area. 
    Maps and studies that establish special flood hazard areas are on file at the City of Dover Department of Planning and Inspections. 
( Ord. No. 2014-09, 6-9-2014 ) 
Sec. 50-5. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    These regulations are not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations, zoning ordinances or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by these regulations.

(4)  Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence, where more restrictive. 
( Ord. No. 2014-09, 6-9-2014 ) 
Sec. 50-7. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside of the special flood hazard areas or uses that are permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the City of Dover, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
( Ord. No. 2014-09, 6-9-2014 ) 
Sec. 50-8. - Severability. 
    Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

ARTICLE IV. - VARIANCES. 

Sec. 50-46. - Variances. 
    The City of Dover construction and property maintenance code board of appeals, as provided for in chapter 22, Buildings and Building Regulations, article I, In General, section 22-1, construction and property maintenance code board of appeals, shall have the power to authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the requirements of these regulations and the flood load and flood load and flood-resistant construction of the building code, not inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship. 
(1)  Application for a variance. 
a.  Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is sought shall submit an application for a variance to the floodplain administrator. 
b.  At a minimum, such application shall contain the following information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use; description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the variance sought; and reason for the variance request. Each variance application shall specifically address each of the considerations in section 50-46(2) and the limitations and conditions of section 50-46(3). 
(2)  Considerations for variances . In considering variance applications, the City of Dover construction and property maintenance code board of appeals shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, requirements specified in other sections of these regulations, and the following factors: 
a.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others. 
b.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 
c.  The susceptibility of the proposed development and its contents (if applicable) to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. 
d.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community. 
e.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to, or are subject to less, flooding or erosion damage. 
f.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable, or if the facility is a functionally dependent use. 
g.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development. 
h.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area. 
i.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
j.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site. 
k.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(3)  Limitations for variances . 
a.  An affirmative decision on a variance request shall only be issued upon: 
1.  A showing of good and sufficient cause. A "good and sufficient" cause is one that deals solely with the physical characteristics of the property and cannot be based on the character of the planned construction or substantial improvement, the personal characteristics of the owner or inhabitants, or local provisions that regulate standards other than health and public safety standards. 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property. 
3.  Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant. 
4.  A determination that the granting of a variance for development within any designated floodway, or special flood hazard area with base flood elevations but no floodway, will not result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations. 
5.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws. 
6.  A determination that the structure or other development is protected by methods to minimize flood damages. 
7.  A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
b.  Upon consideration of the individual circumstances, the limitations and conditions, and the purposes of these regulations, the City of Dover construction and property maintenance code board of appeals may attach such conditions to variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations. 
c.  The City of Dover construction and property maintenance code board of appeals shall notify any applicant in writing to whom a variance is granted for a building or structure with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation that the variance is to the floodplain management requirements only, and that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk.

    Person: An individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local governments and agencies. 
    Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is built on a single chassis, 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Special flood hazard area: The land in the floodplain subject flood hazards and shown on a Flood Insurance Rate Map as Zones A, AE, and AO. The term includes areas shown on other flood hazard maps that are specifically listed or otherwise described in section 50-4. 
    Start of construction: The date of issuance of permits for new construction and substantial improvements to existing structures, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days after the date of issuance. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, installation of pilings, or construction of columns. Permanent construction does not include land preparation (such as clearing, grading and filling), the installation of streets or walkways, excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations, the erection of temporary forms or the installation of accessory buildings such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For a substantial improvement, the actual "start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure (or building): That which is built or constructed. 
    Substantial damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement: Any repair, alteration, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary, or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
    Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's flood plain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in these regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time that documentation is provided.

Chapter 59 - JUVENILE CURFEW 

Sec. 59-1. - Definitions. 
    When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future, words in the plural number include the singular, and words in the singular number include the plural. The word "shall" is always mandatory and not merely directory. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    City means the City of Dover, Delaware, with administrative offices at 15 Loockerman Plaza, Dover, Delaware. 
    Emergency means an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for immediate action. The term includes, but is not limited to, a fire, natural disaster, automobile accident, or any situation requiring immediate action to prevent serious bodily injury or loss of life. 
    Establishment means any privately owned place of business operated for a profit to which the public is invited, including, but not limited to, any place of amusement or entertainment. 
    Juvenile or minor means any unemancipated person under the age of 17 or, in equivalent phrasing often herein employed, any person 16 or fewer years of age. 
    Operator means any individual, firm, association, partnership, or corporation operating, managing, or conducting any establishment. The term includes the members or partners of an association or partnership and the officers of a corporation. 
    Parent means any person having legal custody of a juvenile: 
(1)  As a natural or adoptive parent. 
(2)  As a legal guardian. 
(3)  As a person who stands in loco parentis. 
(4)  As a person to whom legal custody has been given by court order. 
    Public place means any place to which the public or a substantial group of the public has access and includes, but is not limited to, streets, common areas of schools, shopping centers, parking lots, parks, playgrounds, transportation facilities, theaters, restaurants, shops, bowling alleys, taverns, cafes, arcades, and similar areas that are open to the use of the public. As a type of public place, a street is a way or place, of whatever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or, in the case of a sidewalk thereof, for pedestrian travel. "Street" includes that legal right-of-way, including, but not limited to, the cartway of traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. 
    Remain means to stay behind, to tarry, and to stay unnecessarily in a public place, including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four or more persons in which any juvenile involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home, or to fail to leave the premises of an establishment when requested to do so by a police officer or the operator of an establishment. To implement this provision with additional precision and precaution, numerous exceptions are expressly defined in this chapter. More exceptions become available with a juvenile's increasing years and advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation. 
    Time of night means based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether Eastern standard time or Eastern daylight savings time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the city, prima facie the time then observed in the city administrative offices and police station. 
    Years of age means continues from one birthday, such as the 16th, to (but not including the day of) the next, such as the 17th birthday, making it clear that 16 or fewer years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase "under 17 years of age." Similarly, for example, 11 or fewer years of age means "under 12 years of age." 
(Ord. No. 2012-06, 4-9-2012) 
Sec. 59-2. - Curfew established. 
(a)  School year curfew. It shall be unlawful for any person 16 years or fewer of age (under 17) to be or remain in or upon a public place within the City of Dover during the Caesar Rodney/Capital School District designated school year for the period ending at 6:00 a.m. and beginning: 
(1)  At 12:00 midnight on Friday and Saturday nights; and

(Ord. No. 2012-06, 4-9-2012) 
Sec. 59-3. - Exceptions.

(1)  Accompanied by parent. When a juvenile is accompanied by a parent of such juvenile. 
(2)  Accompanied by authorized adult. When a juvenile is accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such juvenile to take said parent's place in accompanying said juvenile for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area. 
(3)  Errand directed, in writing, by parent. When the juvenile is on an errand as directed by his/her parent, provided that such juvenile shall have on his/her person a written note, signed by the juvenile's parent, stating: 
a.  The date and time that the note was written (which shall not be more than 24 hours before the time of the errand); 
b.  The name of the juvenile; 
c.  The name, address, and telephone number of the parent; and 
d.  The specific errand directed by the parent. 
(4)  Emergency. When a juvenile is assisting in an emergency, including, by way of example and not in limitation, responding as a member of a volunteer fire company to a fire company or paramedic call. 
(5)  First amendment rights. When a juvenile is exercising first amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech, and the right of assembly, by first delivering, to the person designated by the city's chief of police to receive such information, a written communication, signed by the juvenile and countersigned, if practicable, by a parent of the juvenile, with his/her home address and telephone number, specifying when, where, and in what manner the juvenile will be in a public place during hours when this chapter is applicable to said minor in the exercise of a first amendment right specified in such communication. 
(6)  Reasonable necessity. In case of reasonable necessity for the juvenile remaining in a public place, but only after the juvenile's parent has communicated to the chief of police or the person designated by the chief of police to receive such notifications the facts establishing the reasonable necessity relating to a specified public place at a designated time for a described purpose, including points of origin and destination. A copy of the communication, or of the police record thereof, duly certified by the chief of police to be correct, with an appropriate notation of the time it was received and of the names and addresses of the parent and juvenile, shall be admissible evidence. 
(7)  On own or neighbor's property. When a juvenile is on the sidewalk or property where the juvenile resides, or on either side of or across the street from the place where the juvenile resides, and the adult owner or resident of that property has given permission for the juvenile to be there. 
(8)  Returning home within one hour of official activity. When a juvenile is returning home from, and within one hour of, the termination or closing of an official school, religious, or other recreational activity supervised by adults, sponsored by the City of Dover, a recognized charitable, benevolent, or civic association, or a similar entity that takes responsibility for the minor. 
(9)  Special permit (individual). When authorized by special permit from the chief of police carried on the person of the juvenile thus authorized, as follows: 
a.  When necessary nighttime activities of a juvenile may be inadequately provided for by other provisions of this chapter, then recourse may be had to the chief of police, either for a regulation as provided in subsection (a)(10) or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant. 
b.  Upon a finding of undue hardship and reasonable necessity for the use of a public place to the extent warranted by a written application signed by a juvenile and by a parent of the juvenile, if feasible, stating: the name, age, and address of the juvenile; the name, address, and telephone number of a parent thereof; the height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair, and other physical characteristics of the juvenile; the necessity that requires the juvenile to remain upon a public place during the curfew hours otherwise applicable and the undue hardship that will result if such permit is not granted; the public place; and the beginning and ending of the period of time involved, by date and hour, the chief of police may grant a permit, in writing, for the juvenile's use of a public place at such hours as in the opinion of the chief of police may reasonably be necessary and consistent with the purposes of this chapter. In an emergency, this may be handled by prior telephone or other effective communication, with a corresponding record being made contemporaneously by the chief of police or by the person designated by the chief of police to act on his/her behalf in an emergency at the police station. 
(10)  Special regulation (group). When authorized by regulation issued by the chief of police in other similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to reasonably necessary nighttime activities of more juveniles than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis, but only where such juveniles will be under the active supervision of adults responsible for such juveniles. Normally such regulation by the chief of police permitting use of public places should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies, such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the public places permitted, the period of time involved, not to extend more than one hour beyond the time for termination of the activity, and the reason for finding that the regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this chapter. 
(11)  Employment necessity. When the juvenile is legally employed, going to or returning home from employment, and carries a certified card of employment, renewable each calendar month when the current facts so warrant, dated or reissued not more than 45 days previously, signed by the parent and employer and briefly identifying the juvenile, the addresses and telephone numbers of the juvenile's home and place of employment, and the juvenile's hours of employment. The city shall prepare a form to be used by employers for purposes of this subsection. 
(12)  Interstate or intrastate travel. When the juvenile is, with parental consent, engaged in normal interstate or intrastate travel through the city or originating or terminating in the city. 
(13)  Married. When the juvenile is married or has been married pursuant to state law. 
(14)  Operator of establishment. In the case of an operator of an establishment, when the operator has notified the police that a juvenile was present on the premises of the establishment during curfew hours and refused to leave. 
(b)  Continuing consideration of exceptions. Each of the foregoing exceptions and their several limitations, such as provisions for notification, are severable, as hereinafter provided but here reemphasized, and will be considered by council when warranted by future experience. 
(Ord. No. 2012-06, 4-9-2012) 
Editor's note- The city employment certificate form, referenced in subsection 59-3(a)(11), is set out at the end of this chapter. 
Sec. 59-4. - Parental responsibility. 
(a)  The foregoing exceptions to the operation of this chapter shall act only to create a waiver of enforcement and affirmative defense(s) to such enforcement. By authorizing such exceptions, neither the city nor any member of the police department shall assume any affirmative obligation or duty to supervise the well-being of any juvenile acting pursuant to such authorized exception. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a juvenile knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to allow the juvenile to remain in any city public place under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this chapter. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a juvenile in that parent's legal custody. This requirement is intended to hold a neglectful or careless parent up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall, therefore, be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such juvenile. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful for any parent to knowingly (as defined above) provide any false authorization, information or certification, written or verbal, to the Dover Police Department in order to obtain an exception to the operation of this chapter under section 59-3 hereof. 
(Ord. No. 2012-06, 4-9-2012) 
Sec. 59-5. - Operator responsibility. 
    It shall be unlawful for any operator of an establishment to knowingly permit a juvenile to remain at the establishment under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this chapter. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that an operator should reasonably be expected to have concerning the patrons of the establishment. The standard for "knowingly" shall be applied through an objective test: whether a reasonable person in the operator's position should have known that the patron was a juvenile in violation of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2012-06, 4-9-2012) 
Sec. 59-6. - Enforcement. 
(a)  If a police officer reasonably believes that a juvenile is in a public place in violation of this chapter, the officer shall notify the juvenile that he/she is in violation of this chapter and shall require the juvenile to provide his/her name, address, and telephone number and how to contact his/her parent or guardian. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the absence of convincing evidence, such as a birth certificate, a police officer shall, in the first instance of violation of the chapter, use his/her best judgment in determining age. 
(b)  The police officer shall issue the juvenile a written warning that the juvenile is in violation of this chapter and order the juvenile to go promptly home. The chief of police shall send the parent or guardian of the juvenile written notice of the violation pursuant to subsection (f) hereof. 
(c)  Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience and may provide that the police officer may deliver to a parent or guardian thereof a juvenile under appropriate circumstances; for example, a juvenile of tender age, near home, whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or are known. 
(d)  Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, when a juvenile has received one previous written warning for violation of this chapter or a police officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the juvenile has engaged in delinquent conduct, the procedure shall then be to take the juvenile to the police station where a parent or guardian shall immediately be notified to come for the juvenile, whereupon the parent or guardian and the juvenile shall be questioned. This is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts and to centralize responsibility in the person designated there and then on duty for accurate, effective, fair, impartial, and uniform enforcement and recording, thus making available experienced personnel and access to information and records. 
(e)  When a parent or guardian, immediately called, has come to take charge of the juvenile and the appropriate information has been recorded, the juvenile shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located or fails to take charge of the juvenile, then the juvenile shall be released to the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that, in accordance with police regulations approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the juvenile may temporarily be entrusted to an adult, neighbor, or other person who will on behalf of a parent or guardian assume the responsibility of caring for the juvenile pending the availability or arrival of a parent or guardian. 
(f)  In the case of a first violation of this chapter by a juvenile, the chief of police shall, by certified mail, send to a parent or guardian written notice of the violation, with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of this chapter, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties. 
(g)  For the first violation of this chapter by an operator of an establishment who permits a juvenile to remain on the premises, a police officer shall issue a written notice of the violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the chapter, including enforcement of operator responsibility and of applicable penalties. 
(h)  In any event the police officer shall, within 24 hours, file a written report with the chief of police or shall participate, to the extent of the information for which he/she is responsible, in the preparation of a report on the curfew violation. It is not the intention of this section to require extensive reports that will prevent police officers from performing their primary police duties. The reports shall be as simple as is reasonably possible and may be completed by police department personnel other than sworn police officers. 
(Ord. No. 2012-06, 4-9-2012) 
Sec. 59-7. - Violations and penalties. 
(a)  Parents. 
(1)  Offenses by the parent. If, after the warning notice pursuant to section 59-6 of a first violation by a juvenile, a parent violates section 59-4 (in connection with a second violation by the juvenile), this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. For offenses by a parent, the fines shall be as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. Any court of competent jurisdiction, upon finding a parent guilty, shall sentence the parent to pay this fine and the cost of prosecution. 
(2)  Personnel costs. The parent or legal guardian having custody of a juvenile subject to this section shall be liable for all costs incurred by the City of Dover for providing personnel to remain in the company of a juvenile who has been detained as a curfew violator if the parent or guardian does not pick up the juvenile within one hour after receiving notice from the city that the city is detaining the juvenile for a curfew violation. The amount to be paid by the parent or guardian shall be as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. 
(3)  The parent or legal guardian having custody of a juvenile subject to this section shall be liable for any fine or condition of restitution or reparation imposed by a court upon a curfew violator, provided that the curfew violator has not paid the fine or made restitution or reparation within the time ordered by the court and further provided that the parent or legal guardian has been made a party defendant in all enforcement proceedings against the curfew violator and shall be served with all citations, summons, complaints, notices, and other documents required to be served on the curfew violator defendant. 
(b)  Juveniles. Any juvenile who shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter more than three times shall be reported by the chief of police to the juvenile authorities as a juvenile in need of supervision, and the chief of police may proceed to file such charges with the courts as he/she may deem appropriate. 
(c)  Operators. If, after the warning notice pursuant to section 59-6 of a violation of this chapter, an operator of an establishment violates section 59-5 a second time, this shall be treated as a first offense by the operator. For offenses by an operator, the fines shall be as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. 
(d)  False certification. Any parent convicted of knowingly providing any false authorization, information or certification, written or verbal, to the Dover police department in violation of section 59-4(c) shall pay a fine as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. 
(Ord. No. 2012-06, 4-9-2012) 
Sec. 59-8. - Advisory opinions. 
    The city manager, after consultation with the city solicitor, is hereby authorized to give advisory opinions, in writing, which shall be binding and shall be adhered to by the police until the chapter is amended in such respect, interpreting terms, phrases, parts, or any provisions. Normally such advisory opinions shall be in response to good faith, signed letters addressed to the city manager or to a member of the city council questioning this chapter as ambiguous, having a potentially chilling effect on constitutional rights specifically invoked or otherwise invalid, in all three categories with respect to proposed conduct definitely described. This administrative remedy must be exhausted prior to presenting to any court a question in any of the three categories. The city council does not intend a result through the enforcement of this chapter that is absurd, impossible of execution, or unreasonable. Council intends that the chapter be held inapplicable in such cases if anywhere its application would be unconstitutional under the Constitution of the State of Delaware or the Constitution of the United States of America. 
(Ord. No. 2012-06, 4-9-2012) 
Sec. 59-9. - Continuing evaluation. 
    The city council shall continue its evaluation and updating of this chapter through methods including but not limited to the following: 
(1)  Within six months after the implementation of this chapter, the chief of police shall provide the city council with a report concerning the effect of this chapter on crimes committed by and against minors and of the number of warnings issued and arrests of minors, parents, and operators hereunder and such other information as council may request. 
(2)  On a regular basis, the city council shall receive informal reports of all exceptional cases hereunder of reasonable necessity, the notices of school and other activities, the special permits and the regulations authorized above, and the advisory opinions for consideration by the council in further updating and continuing evaluation of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2012-06, 4-9-2012) 
Sec. 59-10. - Notice. 
    Notice of the existence of this chapter and of the curfew regulations established by it shall be posted in, on, or about such public or quasi-public places as may be determined by the city manager or the police department in order that the public may be constantly informed of the existence of this chapter and its regulations.

If the member had completed at least 15 years of service at the date of such termination, he shall be entitled to receive the retirement income accrued by him pursuant to section 62-76(a), to begin on the first day of the month coinciding with or next following his 60th birthday.

Sec. 62-81. - Assignment, alienation, etc., of benefits. 
    Except as may be prohibited by law, no benefit under the plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, encumbrance, or charge, and any attempt to do so shall be void.

(b)  Not contractual. 
(1)  While the city intends to continue the plan indefinitely, nevertheless, it assumes no contractual obligation as to its continuance, nor as to the continuance of its contributions thereunder. The plan may be terminated for any reason at any time by the city. If the plan is terminated, the assets held in the trust fund and under the group contract attributable to the contributions of the city and members shall be allocated pursuant to the directions of the city on the basis of actuarial valuations to the extent of the sufficiency of such assets and amounts, for the purpose of providing retirement income or other benefits determined by the city to have accrued under the plan to the date of termination of the plan for members and their eligible survivors and beneficiaries for whom and/or to the extent that such retirement income has not been already purchased under the group contract and which will be payable in accordance with the provisions of such contract. The allocation of all such remaining assets relating to members of this plan shall be in the following manner and order: 
a.  Assets equal to the sum of each member's accumulated contributions, which have not been applied to purchase annuities under the group contract and which are in excess of retirement income previously paid to the member and the eligible survivor and beneficiaries of a deceased member, shall be allocated for the benefit of such member or the eligible survivor or beneficiary of a deceased member. 
b.  An amount shall be allocated to provide retirement income not previously purchased under the group contract to: 
1.  All persons who were receiving benefits; and 
2.  Members remaining in the employ of the city who have reached their retirement date. 
c.  Assets then remaining shall be allocated to provide benefits not provided above for members still in the service of the city who would qualify for retirement. 
d.  Amounts then remaining shall be allocated to provide retirement income not provided above, nor previously purchased under the group contract for members entitled to retirement income pursuant to section 62-76(a) or who would be entitled to such retirement income if their service were terminated on the date of termination of the plan. 
e.  Amounts then remaining shall be allocated to provide accrued retirement income for all members not provided for above. 
f.  If any amounts remain after complete allocation for the purpose of subsections (b)(1)a.-e. of this section, such amounts shall be paid to the city. 
(2)  In the event assets shall be insufficient to discharge the liabilities of any class, the amount available for such class shall be allocated among the members of that class in proportion to the liabilities for retirement income not previously purchased under the group contract. 
(3)  Amounts allocated in accordance with subsections (b)(1)a.-e. of this section may be applied, in the discretion of the city, to provide benefits through the purchase of paid-up annuities on an individual or group basis, or any other means deemed appropriate.

Chapter 66 - MANUFACTURED HOMES, MOBILE HOMES, AND LAND LEASE COMMUNITIES[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2018-01, adopted September 24, 2018, repealed ch. 66, §§ 66-1-66-8 and enacted a new ch. 66 as set out herein. Former ch. 66 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from an ordinance adopted February 23, 1970; an ordinance adopted July 28, 1975; an ordinance adopted May 24, 1976; an ordinance adopted March 27, 1980; the Code of 1981; an ordinance adopted November 10, 1986; an ordinance adopted August 8, 1993; Ord. No. 2009-09, adopted June 22, 2009; and Ord. No. 2016-16 , adopted August 8, 2016. 

Sec. 66-1. - Purpose statement. 
    The City of Dover recognizes that manufactured homes are a unique housing type with their own history of placement and ownership traditions arising from their origins as mobile homes. A modern manufactured home does not resemble a vehicle, and once placed is rarely moved. However, most manufactured homes are owned as if they were vehicles, separate from the land they are placed on, and may theoretically be moved at any time. Because of this the city recognizes that consistent standards are needed for placement, licensing, and tracking of manufactured homes, in order to ensure the homes' orderly movement into, out of, and around the city. 
    The city further recognizes that land lease communities, which may give ground lease to manufactured homes or other types of housing, typify a use of land which does not align perfectly with either apartments or residential subdivisions. Because of this, areas of responsibility on the part of residents, owners, and the city with regard to maintenance, communication, and taxation can be unclear without the adoption of consistent standards governing these areas of responsibility. The city recognizes that where responsibility is not clearly claimed detrimental conditions can arise for residents. 
    This chapter therefore lays out consistent standards needed for manufactured homes and land lease communities, while updating and consolidating earlier city regulations regarding mobile homes and mobile home parks. The standards are intended to be applicable to all land lease communities currently in the city or which may be established in the future. They are also intended to cover both manufactured homes and permanently placed manufactured homes, and the issues unique to each. They are intended to supplement, rather than replace, all state laws regulating manufactured homes, including, but not limited to, those found in 25 Del. C., Chapter 70, and 24 Del. C., Chapter 44. 
(Ord. No. 2018-01 , 9-24-2018) 
Sec. 66-2. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Land lease community means a residential development typified by single ownership of the land within the development, with the landowner retaining the rights of ownership. Home sites or individual lots within the community are leased to individual homeowners, who retain customary leasehold rights. A manufactured home park is considered a type, but not the only type, of land lease community. 
    Land lease community operator means any person designated by contractual arrangement with the land lease community owner to supervise or maintain a land lease community and interact with its residents. 
    Land lease community owner means the owner of two or more home sites offered for rent within a land lease community. It includes a lessor, sublessor, park owner or receiver of two or more home sites offered for rent, as well as any person, other than a lender not in possession, who directly or indirectly receives rents for two or more home sites offered for rent and who has no obligation to deliver such rents to another person. 
    Manufactured home means a factory-built, single-family dwelling: 
a.  Transportable in one or more sections, which is either eight body feet or more in width and 40 body feet or more in length, or, when erected on site, has more than 400 square feet in living area; and 
b.  Designed to be used as a year-round dwelling when connected to the required utilities; and 
c.  Manufactured after June 15, 1976, and built in accordance with manufactured home construction requirements promulgated by the federal department of housing and urban development (The HUD Code). 
    Mobile home means a factory-built, single-family dwelling: 
a.  Transportable in one or more sections, which is either eight body feet or more in width and 40 body feet or more in length, or, when erected on site, has more than 400 square feet in living area; and 
b.  Designed to be used as a year-round dwelling when connected to the required utilities; and 
c.  Manufactured before June 15, 1976, and not built in accordance with manufactured home construction requirements promulgated by the federal department of housing and urban development (The HUD Code). Prior to the HUD code, mobile homes were not subject to uniform construction or safety standards. 
    Owner of a manufactured home or mobile home means the person designated in the vehicle title of the manufactured home or mobile home, whether the title is issued by this state or by some other state. 
    Owner of a permanently placed manufactured home means the person designated in the vehicle or real property title of the permanently placed manufactured home, whether the title is issued by this state or by some other state. 
    Permanently placed manufactured home means a manufactured home that has been placed upon a permanent, unmovable foundation. 
    Utility means a service provided by a land lease community owner, the city, or others to a tenant for a commodity such as water, sewer, electricity, fuel, propane, cable television or trash. 
(Ord. No. 2018-01 , 9-24-2018) 
Sec. 66-3. - Manufactured and mobile homes. 
(a)  Placement permit . Every owner of a manufactured home shall apply for and obtain from the city planner or his/her authorized agent a placement permit for such manufactured home prior to placement of the home within the city. The owner of the manufactured home shall pay a fee for such permit as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a newly placed manufactured home that has not also been issued a placement permit. 
(b)  Inspection . Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any manufactured home, the home shall pass inspection by a city building inspector licensed as a manufactured home inspector by the state. The owner of the manufactured home shall cause a manufactured home installer licensed by the state to firmly attach the home to the ground by means of a permanent foundation or anchors, and cause any open space beneath the unit to be skirted or enclosed with material approved by the building inspector. 
(c)  License . The owner of any mobile home or manufactured home that is not placed on a permanent foundation shall obtain an annual license for it. The owner of the mobile home or manufactured home shall pay an annual fee for such license as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. If such manufactured home is newly moved into the city, the owner of the manufactured home shall obtain the license and shall pay the license fee within seven days of issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the home. Payment of the license fee shall be prorated on a quarterly basis for each fractional part of a year during which the manufactured home is in the city. 
(d)  Conditions for license . No license for a new manufactured home shall be issued until the home has passed inspection and received a certificate of occupancy as required by this section. 
(e)  Moving within or out of city . When the owner of a mobile home or manufactured home removes the home from its current site or lot, the owner shall obtain a demolition permit for the removal. 
(f)  Use of city utilities . Owners of all types of manufactured homes shall coordinate with city departments during the permitting and licensing process regarding the appropriate times to transfer responsibility for utilities and activate service.

(2)  Debris clearance. It shall be the responsibility of land lease community owners to ensure that all facilities and common areas within the community are kept in good repair and maintained in such a manner as to prevent the accumulation of materials which could cause a fire hazard or would cause insect or rodent breeding and harborage. 
(3)  Landscaping. The land lease community owner shall keep the community free of species of weeds or plant growth which are noxious or detrimental to the health of the residents. In addition, the land lease community owner shall maintain, care for, and, if necessary, remove any trees planted within the community that are over 25 feet in height or have a main stem/trunk over six inches in diameter. Maintenance shall be performed per standard horticultural practices in accordance with the standards as set forth by the American Association of Nurserymen, and shall not require removal of any plant material normally produced by the tree as part of its lifecycle. The landlord must respect the privacy of tenants and not enter any rented lot to maintain, care for, and/or remove landscaping without the permission of the tenant or an adult resident unless emergency circumstances exist and entry is required to prevent injury to person or damage to property. 
(4)  Utilities. The land lease community owner shall keep all water, electrical, plumbing, gas, septic, sewer, and other utilities they provide to tenants in good working order. Stormwater management facilities shall be maintained so as to be free of blockage and to prevent the accumulation of standing water that does not dissipate within 48 hours, except in facilities approved for retention of water. These utilities and facilities shall be repaired within 48 hours of written notification of a maintenance problem, or as soon thereafter as is practicable if a repair within 48 hours is not practicable. Community owners shall coordinate with the City of Dover regarding utility services and equipment. 
(5)  Delegation of maintenance duties . Maintenance responsibilities may be delegated by the land lease community owner to leaseholders, a homeowner's association, a land lease community operator, or other parties, provided that the delegated party's specific responsibilities are detailed in a rental agreement, property management contract, or other contract as appropriate. The following exceptions apply: 
a.  Maintenance responsibilities delegated to individual leaseholders shall not include physical responsibility over any streets, common areas, or utilities. Community owners may still require payments from leaseholders to contribute to these areas' upkeep. 
b.  Maintenance responsibilities shall not be delegated if doing so would violate any state laws regulating the content of any of the above types of contracts. 
c.  Any maintenance responsibilities not specifically delegated shall be retained by the land lease community owner.

(2)  Receipt for lot payment. The land lease community operator or owner shall provide a written receipt or electronic receipt at the time a cash payment for rent payment has been made.

The community owner or operator shall, for a period of three years, maintain a record of all cash receipts for rent. 
(3)  Homeowner record . To assist in keeping city license records and tax records up to date, and to assist in code enforcement, land lease community owners who lease land to two or more persons for home sites shall maintain a record of all persons owning homes on their land, specifying each home's address, the name of the owner of each manufactured home, and each homeowner's address, if different from the home address. This record shall be reported to the city planner before July 1 of each year, and shall also be open for inspection by the city planner at all other reasonable times. 
(4)  Required license for landowners . The owner of any land leased out as part of a land lease community shall obtain an annual land lease community operator business license under the provisions of Chapter 26-Businesses, or direct the land lease community operator to obtain this license. Only one business license shall be required per land lease community. The fee for such license shall be based on the total number of lots or home sites in the community, including both vacant and occupied lots and sites, in accordance with Appendix F-Fees and Fines, Chapter 26-Businesses.

When the city council has completed the procedures included in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the descriptions of all abutting properties and the names of those property owners shall be entered on the municipal lien docket. This shall be considered notice to all property owners and subsequent purchasers that the abutting properties shall be assessed for the work or improvements under the provisions of this chapter. 
(Code 1981, § 18.7-2; Ord. of 6-13-1983; Ord. of 9-9-1991) 
Sec. 94-3. - Determination of individual assessments. 
    Within 60 days after the completion of construction on any municipal improvement or work, the city council shall determine the actual cost of the improvement or work and the share assessable against the abutting properties. 
(Code 1981, § 18.7-3; Ord. of 6-13-1983) 
Sec. 94-4. - Basis for assessments and deferred assessments. 
(a)  Assessments. Assessments shall be based on the enhanced value of the property subsequent to the municipal improvement or work over and above the value of the property prior to the municipal improvement or work. When the improvement or work abuts only a portion of the property, the rule for determining enhanced value shall be applied in determining the amount of assessment. In determining enhanced value, the city council shall not be limited to a consideration of the actual use of the property at the time of the improvement or work, but may also consider customary and available uses. 
(b)  Deferred assessments. If the council determines that there is not immediate benefit to the property with respect to which the improvement or improvements abut or if the improvements do not specifically enhance the value of the abutting property or when the cost of such improvements are approximately equal to the market value of the land which they abut, then the council, in its discretion, instead of levying an assessment against the abutting property, may defer the assessment until a time when building permits are issued for lots abutting the improvements or when the council determines that the assessment should be levied. The council may also choose to defer assessments for abutting property when the improvements or work are for the benefit of the city at large and located on undeveloped property. The council may choose to make the assessment when building permits are issued for the undeveloped property or at such other time as the council deems appropriate. 
(Code 1981, § 18.7-4; Ord. of 6-13-1983) 
Sec. 94-5. - Entry of assessment liens; satisfaction. 
(a)  Entry. Whenever an abutting property is assessed for municipal improvements or work, there shall be a notation of the lien for the assessment noted on the municipal lien docket. When the assessment is deferred pursuant to section 94-4(b), an appropriate notation shall be made on the municipal lien docket. 
(b)  Satisfaction. When the liens are satisfied by payment in full, there shall be entered on the municipal lien docket the date of payment and the term "Satisfaction in Full." 
(Code 1981, § 18.7-5; Ord. of 6-13-1983) 
Sec. 94-6. - Assessment due date; delinquent payments. 
    Municipal improvements and work assessments shall be due and payable within 30 days after mailing the assessment notices to the owners of the properties affected at the time of the enactment of the assessment ordinance. Assessments not paid within the prescribed time shall bear interest in favor of the city, at a rate to be determined by the council at the time of the assessment; however, such rate shall not be less than six percent per annum. 
(Code 1981, § 18.7-6; Ord. of 6-13-1983; Ord. of 1-27-1986) 
Sec. 94-7. - Appeals. 
(a)  Authorized. Any person owning property or having an interest in property which is assessed under the provision of this chapter may file a written notice of appeal of the assessment with the city council within 30 days after the mailing of the assessment notice. Within 60 days after the filing of the appeal, the city council shall fix a time for the hearing and notify the appellant. 
(b)  Hearing. At the appeal, the city council shall hear all relevant evidence and shall decide the reasonableness of the assessment as soon as may be convenient. The council may impose whatever terms or conditions on its decision that it considers appropriate in view of the purposes of this chapter. The council may affirm or modify the assessment on the property in question to reflect any increased value of the property as a result of the municipal improvement or work. 
(c)  Rebate. Should the final disposition of the appeal extend beyond the date that the assessment is due and payable, the assessment shall be due and payable on the date set and any modification of the assessment that causes a lower assessment shall result in a rebate of that part of the assessment considered by the council to be excessive. 
(Code 1981, § 18.7-7; Ord. of 6-13-1983) 
Sec. 94-8. - Nonapplicability where appendix A applies. 
    The provision of this chapter relating to municipal work or improvements shall have no application where the procedure for causing work or improvements to be done or made is specified in appendix A to this Code pertaining to subdivisions. 
(Code 1981, § 18.7-8; Ord. of 6-13-1983) 
Sec. 94-9. - Determination method of front foot charges for water and sewer main assessments. 
(a)  Established. It is the intent of this section to establish the method of determining front foot charges for water and sewer main assessments. The front foot charge for each project shall be determined by the city council. 
(b)  Generally. 
(1)  The front foot charge for water and sewer main installation shall be determined by frontage on the street, and the property shall be assessed for a property depth not exceeding 150 feet. This is a charge for each front foot on both sides of the street. No separate area assessment is to be levied. 
(2)  The front foot charge shall include the cost of construction of the project, except for those items listed in subsection (b)(7) of this section to be deleted, and the cost of design and inspection of the project. 
(3)  Each deeded lot shall be separately assessed. 
(4)  If a lot can be served, the front foot charge will be assessed. 
(5)  For projects which are only to serve one side of the road (i.e., if an additional main will be required to serve the opposite side of the road), the front foot charge shall be determined as above for the properties to be served. No assessments shall be levied against the opposite side of the road. In no case shall the side to be served be charged the costs which would be assessed against the opposite side of the road. 
(6)  Each January, the city council, on recommendation of the city manager, shall establish uniform front foot rates for assessable water and sewer projects scheduled for the following 12 months. In no case shall the front foot charge assessed to a property exceed the uniform rate set by the city council. If the front foot charge for a project is less than the uniform rate, only the actual project charge shall be assessed. 
(7)  The following improvements shall be deleted from the cost analysis to determine the front foot charge: 
a.  Treatment facilities. 
b.  Sewer pumping stations. 
c.  Sewer force mains. 
d.  Interceptor lines. 
e.  Fire hydrants. 
f.  Mains larger than eight inches in diameter. 
(8)  All water and sewer assessments shall be payable within ten years from the date of assessment. 
(c)  Frontage determination. All straight and curved frontages shall be assessed as shown in the property deeds on both sides of the street. 
(d)  Corner lots. For corner lots: 
(1)  If a main is installed in both streets, the lot will be assessed on its longest side. 
(2)  If a main is installed on one street, the assessment will be on the lot frontage of that street for a depth of 150 feet. 
(3)  The frontage shall be measured along the lot line and include one-half the arc if the intersection corner is rounded, and if the intersection corner is not rounded, the frontage shall include to the point of intersection. 
(e)  Lots with frontage on two parallel streets. For lots with frontage on two parallel streets: 
(1)  Where the distance between the streets is 300 feet or more, the total frontage to a depth of 150 feet on both streets will be assessed. 
(2)  Where the distance between the two streets is less than 300 feet, the longest frontage to a depth of one-half the distance between the two streets will be assessed. 
(f)  End of main. Full frontage shall be assessed for all lots the main can serve. 
(g)  Exempt property. The following property is exempt from assessment: 
(1)  City-owned property. 
(2)  Rights-of-way or assessments deeded to the city. 
(3)  Previously assessed property. 
(4)  Property already served with city standard mains. 
(h)  Deferred assessments. Deferred assessments include the following: 
(1)  Agricultural land, until developed. 
(2)  Any other property by vote of the city council.

    Speed bump shall mean a transverse hump, generally designed as a rounded, raised pavement structure usually from two to six inches high and one to three feet from front to back, set into the surface of a street, parking lot, or driveway to slow the traffic. Their design generally dictates comfortable crossing speeds of five miles per hour or less so they are usually appropriate only for use where vehicle speeds are typically the lowest to begin with such as parking lots, private roads, and on some residential streets. 
    Speed cushion shall mean a speed hump with an unraised path for fire trucks and ambulances through the hump. Speed cushions are devices designed as several small speed humps installed across the width of the road with spaces between them.

    Speed hump shall mean a raised area in the pavement surface, usually from three to four inches high and 10 to 12 feet from front to back, extending transversely across the travel way. The purpose of the length of a speed hump is to allow the entire vehicle to be on the hump at once before it descends the far side onto the pavement to reduce the likelihood that a vehicle will "bottom out" when going over the speed hump. Speed humps are typically applied to residential streets where speed limits do not exceed 25 miles per hour. 
(b)  Prohibited. Any device used as a means of speed reduction on any city street, drive, parking lot, or any other driveable surface, which causes a change in elevation which may result in emergency equipment having to reduce speed during a time of emergency, is prohibited. 
(c)  Permitted. Speed cushions may be installed on privately owned commercial property, at the owner's expense, following review by the Safety Advisory and Transportation Committee and approval by city council. Any other type of speed reduction device on private commercial property within the city is prohibited. 
(d)  Installation and design standards. Installation and design standards for speed cushions shall be in accordance with the Delaware Traffic Calming Design Manual.

Once the requirements of subsection (1) of this section have been met, the city clerk shall refer the request to the development advisory committee (DAC) to obtain comments of all involved parties, specifically including the police department, fire department, public works department, department of planning and inspections, city assessor, and city manager. The response from the DAC shall be submitted to the city clerk. In considering the request for the name change, the DAC is specifically directed to consider appendix A to this Code (article VI, section A) regarding the naming of new streets. 
(3)  Planning commission review. The city clerk shall refer the petition and the DAC comments directly to the planning commission for its review and recommendation regarding the request. Once considered by the planning commission, its recommendation shall be returned to the city clerk. No public hearing is required before the planning commission and the planning commission shall recommend approval of the change of name or disapproval of the change of name, along with its reasons. 
(4)  Utility committee review. Once the planning commission's recommendation is received by the city clerk, then the recommendation and the entire file, including the request and the DAC comments, shall be submitted to the utility committee for review and recommendation directly to the council. 
(5)  Notice of hearing. Once the council receives the recommendations from the utility committee, a public hearing shall be scheduled for a regular council meeting regarding the request, and notice of the public hearing shall be given by the city clerk by placing such notice in one edition of a local newspaper, to be published at least ten days prior to the date of the public hearing before the city council. 
(6)  Council hearing. The council shall hear public comments at the public hearing and shall also receive the comments of the planning commission and the utility committee, and shall, at the conclusion of the public hearing, vote to approve the change of name or to disapprove the change of name. An affirmative vote to change the name shall require an affirmative vote of two-thirds of all persons elected to the council. If the change of name is granted, then notification thereof shall be given to the city manager to implement the name change.

(a)  Factors considered. The city planner shall first review the submitted applications, plans, photos, and related information to determine if the property is a qualifying historic property. In making this determination, the city planner shall consider the following: 
(1)  The property's significant value as part of the historical, cultural, artistic, social, ethnic or other heritage of the nation, state or city; 
(2)  The property's association with an important person or event in national, state, or local history;

(3)  The proposed application constitutes an exterior restoration project readily seen from a street, sidewalk, or public way, which accurately recovers the form and detail of a property and its setting as it appeared at a particular period of time in the past by means of removal of later work or by the replacement of missing earlier work; or 
(4)  The proposed application conforms with the recommended practices and treatments of the design standards and guidelines for the city historic district.

(b)  Periodic review. At least every five years, DED will review the cost inputs that formed the basis of the pole attachment rate and adjust the rate accordingly. 
(c)  Payment period. Fees shall be calculated and payable on a pro-rata basis for the portion of the year during which an attaching entity holds a permit for such attachment. 
(d)  Billing. DED shall invoice licensee for the payments annually. DED will submit to the licensee an invoice for the annual rental period no later than July 1 of each year. The initial annual rental period shall commence upon the execution of an agreement and conclude on June 30 of the next year, and each subsequent annual rental period shall commence on the following July 1 and conclude on June 30 of the subsequent year.

At the discretion of DED, a licensee may be required to pay in advance all reasonable costs, including, but not limited to, administrative, construction, inspections and make-ready work expenses, in connection with the initial installation or rearrangement of licensee's attachments pursuant to the procedures set forth below. 
(i)  Determination of charges. Wherever this chapter or an associated license agreement requires a licensee to pay for work done or contracted by DED, the charge for such work shall include all reasonable material, labor, engineering, administrative and overhead costs that are not otherwise recovered in the annual attachment fee. DED's invoices shall be based upon actual costs, and such costs will be determined in accordance with DED's cost-accounting systems used for recording capital and expense activities. All such invoices shall include an itemization of dates of work, location of work, labor costs per hour, persons employed and materials used and cost of materials. 
(j)  Inventory. Upon enactment of this section, the DED shall provide an inventory of the poles to each licensee. DED will provide this inventory list within 15 calendar days to the licensee, the licensee shall respond with any discrepancies to DED within 60 calendar days and these will be mutually resolved within 15 days. A failure of the licensee to respond within the 60 days or resolve the discrepancy within 15 days shall constitute acceptance of the DED inventory. For any disputed attachments, the licensee shall provide definitive proof that they are not attaching to the DED facilities, for example pictures or other video media. 
A joint inventory of all attachments shall be made no less than once every five (5) years nor earlier than every four (4) years by DED and all licensees, unless all parties agree to a new inventory schedule. The cost of the inventory shall be shared pro rata between DED and the licensees based on the number of attachments (not including overlash) subject to the inventory and to the terms of any agreement with said licensees. The cost of the inventory shall be shared by all attaching parties, based upon the gross number of pole attachments as discovered at the end of the inventory. DED is assumed to have one (1) attachment per pole. For example, the electric utility has 100 poles, cable company has 50 attachments, telephone company has 25 attachments-this is a total of 175 attachments-the cost of the inventory would be divided by 175 then multiplied by 100 for the electric utility, 50 for the cable company and 25 for the telephone company. At the expiration of five (5) years from the completion of any inventory, licensee or DED may request an inventory of attachments, in writing, at least six (6) months prior to the end of the calendar year preceding the year the inventory is to commence. Licensee will be required to provide documentation indicating the year of attachment for any of licensee's attachments on DED's poles not recorded at the time of the previous inventory. 
(k)  Work performed by DED. Wherever this section or an associated license agreement requires DED to perform any work, licensee acknowledges and agrees that DED, at its sole discretion, may utilize its own qualified employees, contractors approved by a licensee, or any combination of the two to perform such work. 
(l)  "True up". Wherever the actual cost of DED's activity exceeds the advance payment of estimated expenses, licensee agrees to pay DED for the difference in cost when that amount exceeds the amount provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. To the extent that the actual cost of the activity is less than the estimated cost, DED shall refund to licensee the difference in cost where that amount exceeds the amount provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. 
(m)  Default for nonpayment. Nonpayment of any undisputed amount due under this section or an associated license agreement beyond 90 days shall constitute a default of this section or the license agreement. 
(5)  Scope of authority. 
(a)  Grant of license. Subject to terms and conditions required or authorized by this section, DED shall grant any qualified applicant a revocable, nonexclusive license to attach communications facilities to DED's poles or to place communications facilities within DED's conduits. 
(b)  Incorporation into license agreements. Except as DED and a licensee may otherwise agree, the provisions of this section shall be deemed incorporated into DED's future license agreements. 
(c)  Right to use DED facilities not granted by franchise. The rights of a person to apply for or use DED facilities shall be governed by this section and its applicable license agreement. The grant of a cable franchise shall not be construed as a grant of attachment rights or authority to use DED facilities without additional compliance by the franchisee with the provisions of this section and any applicable license agreement(s). 
(d)  Permit issuance conditions. DED will issue a permit to a licensee only when DED determines, in its sole judgment, exercised reasonably, that; 
(i)  It has sufficient capacity to accommodate the requested attachment(s); 
(ii)  The licensee meets all requirements set forth in this section and any applicable license agreement, and 
(iii)  Such permit complies with all applicable standards. 
(e)  Reserved capacity. DED will grant access to assigned space on its poles to licensee with the understanding that certain poles may be subject to reserve capacity for future electric service use. At the time of permit issuance DED may notify the licensee that capacity on particular poles is being reserved for future electric use within the next five years pursuant to a bona fide development plan. For attachments made with notice of such a bona fide plan, on giving licensee at least 120 calendar days prior notice, DED may reclaim such reserved capacity at anytime during the five-year period following the installation of licensee's attachment if required for DED's future electric service use, including the attachment of communications lines for internal DED operational or governmental communications requirements. DED shall give a licensee the option to remove its attachment(s) from the affected pole(s) or to pay for the cost of any make-ready work needed to expand capacity so that licensee can maintain its attachment on the affected pole(s). The allocation of the cost of any such make-ready work (including the transfer, rearrangement, or relocation of third-party Attachments) shall be determined in accordance with subsection (4)(g). 
(f)  No interest in property. No use, however lengthy, of any DED facilities, and no payment of any fees or charges required under this section or an applicable license agreement, shall create or vest in a licensee any easement or other ownership or property right of any nature in any portion of such DED facilities. Neither a license agreement nor any permit granted to a licensee shall constitute an assignment of any of DED's rights to the DED facilities. Notwithstanding anything in an agreement to the contrary, a licensee shall, at all times, be and remain a licensee only. 
(g)  Licensee's right to attach. Nothing in this section or any associated license agreement, other than a permit issued pursuant to subsection (8), shall be construed as granting a licensee a right to attach its communications facilities or electric facilities to any specific pole or any portion of conduit. DED shall not be required to grant a permit to a licensee unless and until the licensee meets all applicable terms and conditions for the receipt of the permit. 
(h)  DED'S rights over poles. This section does not in any way limit DED's right to locate, operate and maintain its poles and conduits in the manner that will best enable it to fulfill its service requirements. 
(i)  Expansion of capacity. DED will take reasonable steps to expand pole or conduit capacity when necessary to accommodate a licensee's request for attachment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section shall be construed to require DED to install, retain, extend, or maintain any pole or portion of conduit for licensee's use when DED does not need such pole or conduit for its own service requirements. 
(j)  Prior agreements. Except as provided in this chapter, nothing herein shall limit, restrict, or prohibit DED from fulfilling any agreement or arrangement regarding poles or conduit into which DED has previously entered. 
(k)  Permitted uses. Any agreement adopted pursuant to this section shall be limited to the uses specifically stated in the agreement and no other use shall be allowed without DED's express written consent to such use. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require DED to allow a licensee to use DED's facilities after the termination of the applicable agreement. 
(l)  Overlashing. The following provisions will apply to overlashing: 
(i)  Overlashing is subject to the permitting requirements of subsection (8). Absent such authorization, overlashing constitutes an unauthorized attachment and is subject to the unauthorized attachment fee specified in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. 
(ii)  Overlashing performed by or on behalf of the licensee or its affiliate shall not increase the annual attachment fee paid by the licensee pursuant to Appendix F-Fees and Fines. Licensee or its affiliate, however, shall be responsible for all make-ready work and other charges associated with the overlashing but shall not be required to pay a separate annual attachment fee for such overlashed attachment. 
(iii)  If overlashing is required to accommodate facilities of a third party that is not affiliated with attaching utility, such third party must enter into a license agreement with DED and obtain permits and must pay a separate attachment fee as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines, as well as the costs of all necessary make-ready work required to accommodate the overlashing. No such permits to third parties shall be granted by DED allowing overlashing of licensee's attachments unless licensee has consented in writing to such overlashing. Overlashing shall not increase the fees and charges paid by Licensee pursuant to Appendix F-Fees and Fines. Nothing in this section or applicable agreement shall prevent a licensee from seeking a contribution from an overlashing third party to defray fees and charges paid by the Licensee. 
(iv)  Make-ready work procedures set forth in subsection (4)(g) shall apply, as necessary, to all overlashing. 
(6)  Specifications. 
(a)  Installation/maintenance of facilities. When a permit is issued pursuant to an agreement, the licensee's facilities shall be installed and maintained in accordance with DED's requirements and specifications. All of a licensee's attachments must comply with all applicable standards. Each licensee shall be responsible for the installation and maintenance of its attachments. Each licensee shall, at its own expense, make and maintain its attachments in safe condition and good repair, in accordance with all applicable standards. 
(b)  Tagging. Licensee shall tag all of its communications facilities as specified in by DED and/or applicable federal, state and local regulations upon installation of such facilities. Previously authorized attachments of a licensee shall be tagged within one year of the execution of a new agreement, unless written permission is granted by the public utilities director to extend this deadline. Failure to provide proper tagging will be considered a violation of the specifications of this section. 
(c)  Interference. No licensee shall allow its communications facilities to impair the ability of DED or any third party to use DED's facilities, nor shall licensee allow its attachments to interfere with the operation of any DED facilities. 
(d)  Protective equipment. Each licensee and its employees and contractors shall utilize and install adequate protective equipment to ensure the safety of people and facilities. Licensee shall at its own expense install protective devices designed to handle the voltage and current impressed on its attachments in the event of a contact with electric facilities. 
(e)  Violation of specifications. If a licensee's communications facilities or electric facilities, or any part of them, are installed, used, or maintained in violation of this section or an associated license agreement, and said licensee has not corrected the violation(s) within 30 calendar days from receipt of written notice of the violation(s) from DED, DED at its option, may correct said conditions. Where the violation is not reasonably capable of being cured within 30 days, the parties shall in good faith negotiate for a longer period as needed, provided that licensee has commenced repairs within 30 days DED will attempt to notify licensee in writing prior to performing such work whenever practicable. When DED believes, however, that such violation(s) pose an immediate threat to the safety of any person or property, will interfere with the performance of DED's service obligations, or will pose an immediate threat to the physical integrity of DED facilities, DED may perform such work and/or take such action as it deems necessary without first giving written notice to the licensee. As soon as practicable thereafter, DED will advise the licensee of the work performed or the action taken. The licensee shall be responsible for all actual and reasonable costs incurred by the DED in taking action pursuant to this subsection. 
(f)  Restoration of DED service. DED's service restoration requirements shall take precedence over any and all work operations of a licensee on DED's poles or within its conduits. 
(g)  Effect of failure to exercise access rights. If a licensee does not exercise any access right granted pursuant to this agreement and/or applicable permit(s) within 90 calendar days of the effective date of such right and any extension thereof, which shall not be unreasonably denied, DED may use the space scheduled for the licensee's attachment(s), for its own needs and/or other attaching entities. In such instances, DED shall endeavor to make other space available to licensee, upon written application, as soon as reasonably possible and subject to all requirements of this section or applicable agreement, including the make-ready work provisions. For purposes of this paragraph, any right shall not be deemed effective until any necessary make ready work is performed. 
(7)  Private and regulatory compliance. 
(a)  Necessary authorizations. DED grants licensees a nondiscriminatory access to poles, conduits and associated public and private rights of way where BVU has the right to authorize the occupancy of licensee's facilities. Before making any attachments to DED's poles or conduits, a licensee must obtain all necessary authorizations from federal, state, and local authorities and all required easements or other permissions from owners of affected private property. DED retains the right to require evidence that licensee has obtained all such consents. A licensee shall defend, indemnify and reimburse DED for all loss and expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that DED may incur as a result of claims by governmental bodies, owners of private property, or other persons, that licensee does not have sufficient rights or authority to place its attachments on or within DED's Facilities. 
(b)  Lawful purpose and use. A licensee's attachments must at all times serve a lawful purpose, and the use of such facilities must comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws. 
(c)  DED's rights. No license agreement or permit granted pursuant to this section shall extend to any DED facilities on which the attachment of licensee's communications facilities would result in impairment or forfeiture of DED's rights. Any license or permit that would result in impairment or forfeiture of DED's rights is void. if any of a licensee's attachments, whether or not installed pursuant to a valid license agreement or permit, would cause such impairment or forfeiture, licensee shall promptly remove its facilities upon receipt of written notice from DED. Notwithstanding the forgoing, a licensee shall have the right to contest any such forfeiture before any of its rights are terminated under the agreement provided that the licensee shall indemnify DED for any actual damages that may result during licensee's challenge. Should licensee fail to remove its attachments within 30 calendar days of receiving written notice from DED, DED shall have the right to perform such removal at the licensee's expense. 
(d)  Effect of consent to construction/maintenance. DED's consent to a licensee's construction or maintenance of specified attachments shall not be deemed consent to the licensee's construction or maintenance of any other attachments. It is a licensee's responsibility to obtain all necessary approvals for each attachment from all appropriate parties or agencies. 
(8)  Permitting. 
(a)  Permit required. A licensee shall not install any new attachments, overlash existing attachments or perform substantial construction or modification on any pole without first applying for and obtaining a permit pursuant to the applicable requirements of Subsection (8)(b), Pole attachment permit application process. No permit shall be required for prior existing authorized attachments, overlashing or service drops. No permit shall be required for routine maintenance or installing service drops from existing poles. Attachments to or rights to occupy DED facilities not covered by this section and an associated license agreement must be separately negotiated. 
(b)  Pole attachment permit application process. The following procedure is to be followed by each Licensee seeking to make or remove Attachments on or from DED's Poles. Note that no entity may make any Attachments to DED's Poles without having first entered into a binding Pole Attachment Agreement. 
(i)  Licensee shall submit a properly executed application for permit, including the pre-permit survey, as follows:

* The parties may substitute a different, mutually agreeable, permit form. 
(i)  The requirements of this section notwithstanding, a license [licensee] may overlash without a permit when an emergency or urgent business matter exists. In such situations, the license [licensee] shall submit an application for a permit within ten business days of the initial start date of such overlashing. 
(d)  DED review of permit application. Upon receipt of a properly executed application for permit (subsection (8)(b)(i)), including the prepermit survey, DED will review the permit application and discuss any issues with licensee, including engineering or make-ready work requirements associated with the permit application. DED's acceptance of the submitted design documents does not relieve the licensee of full responsibility for any errors and/or omissions in the engineering analysis. 
(i)  Review period. DED shall review and respond to "minor" permit applications-less than ten attachments/poles-within 30 days of receipt. DED shall review and respond to "major" permit applications-ten or more attachments/poles-within 45 days of receipt. 
(ii)  Expedited review. In instances where a licensee notifies DED of an immediate need to make new attachments, overlash existing attachments or perform substantial construction or modification on a pole, and provides information as to the need for an expedited review process, DED shall make its best reasonable efforts to review and respond to permit applications within 15 days of receipt. DED reserves the rights to charge a licensee for any overtime or other applicable costs that it incurs in meeting a request for an expedited review. 
(e)  Performance of make-ready work. If make-ready work is required to accommodate a licensee's attachments, DED or its contractors shall perform such work pursuant to subsection (9). 
(f)  Permit as authorization to attach. After receipt of payment for any necessary make-ready work, DED will sign and return the permit application, which shall serve as authorization for the licensee to make its attachment(s). 
(9)  Make-ready work. 
(a)  Estimate for make-ready work. In the event DED determines that it can not accommodate a request for attachment(s), including overlashing of an existing attachment, it will, upon request, advise the applicant of any estimated make-ready work charges necessary to accommodate the attachment. 
(b)  Payment of make-ready work. Unless otherwise agreed, DED may require payment in advance for all make-ready work based upon the estimated cost of such work if the estimate exceeds the amount provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. Upon completion, licensee shall pay DED's actual cost of make-ready work. The costs of which shall be itemized. 
(c)  Who may perform make-ready work. Make-ready work shall be performed only by DED and/or a contractor authorized by DED to perform such work. If DED cannot perform the make-ready work to accommodate licensee's communications facilities within 75 calendar days of licensee's request for attachments, licensee may notify DED in writing of its intent to employ a qualified contractor to perform such work, and shall specify when such work shall be performed. In all instances all "qualified contractors" must be preapproved by DED for such work on an annual basis. 
(d)  Scheduling make-ready work. In performing all make-ready work, DED will endeavor to include such work in its normal work schedule. If an applicant requests that the make-ready work be performed on a priority basis or outside of DED's normal work hours, the applicant shall pay any resulting increased costs. Nothing herein shall be construed to require DED to perform such make-ready work before other scheduled or emergency work. 
(e)  Written approval of installation plans required. Before commencing any installation of its communications facilities on DED's poles, including overlashing of existing attachments, licensee shall provide a copy of licensee's plans for installation, which shall accompany the permit application, including the name of the party (licensee and/or contractor) performing such work and the approximate date(s) and time(s) during which such work will be completed. All such work is subject to the insurance requirements of this section. 
(f)  Licensee's installation/removal/maintenance work. 
(i)  Licensee shall perform all installation, removal, and maintenance work at licensee's sole cost and expense, in a good and workmanlike manner, and must not adversely affect the structural integrity of DED's poles or facilities or any other attaching entity's facilities or equipment attached thereto. 
(ii)  All of licensee's installation, removal, and maintenance work performed on DED's poles or near or in other DED facilities, either by its employees or contractors, shall comply with all applicable regulations specified in this section and applicable agreement. Each licensee shall assure that any person installing, maintaining, or removing its communications facilities is fully qualified and familiar with all applicable standards. 
(10)  Transfers. 
(a)  Required transfers of licensee's communications facilities. If DED reasonably determines that a transfer of licensee's communications facilities is necessary, licensee agrees to make such transfer. License [Licensee] shall transfer its facilities within 30 days of notice from DED. If licensee fails to transfer its facilities within 30 calendar days after receiving such notice from DED, DED shall have the right to transfer licensee's facilities using its personnel and/or contractors at licensee's expense. DED shall not be liable for damage to licensee's facilities except to the extent provided in subsection (18)(a). 
(b)  Billing for transfers performed by DED. If DED performs the transfer(s), DED will bill licensee for actual costs per subsection (4) Fees and charges. Licensee shall reimburse DED within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the invoice. 
(11)  Modifications or replacements. 
(a)  Licensee's action requiring modification/replacement. If any pole or conduit to which a licensee desires to make attachment(s) is unable to support or accommodate the requested attachment(s) in accordance with applicable specifications, DED will notify the licensee whether, and if so, at what cost, DED's poles or conduits can be modified or replaced to accommodate the additional attachment(s). If licensee elects to go forward with such modifications or replacements, it shall pay to DED the actual cost of the make-ready work performed by DED. DED may, at its discretion, require advance payment. Licensee shall also be responsible for obtaining and furnishing to DED before the commencement of any make-ready work, agreements between the licensee and the other attaching entities (including overlashers) concerning the relocation or rearrangement of their attachments and the costs involved. 
(b)  Treatment of multiple requests. If DED receives permit applications for the same pole or conduit from two or more prospective licensees within 60 calendar days of the initial request, and accommodating their respective requests would require modification or replacement of the pole or conduit, DED will allocate among such persons or entities the applicable costs associated with such modification or replacement. 
(c)  Guying. The use of guying to accommodate a licensee's attachments shall be provided by and at the expense of the licensee and to the satisfaction of DED as specified in the license agreement or associated documents. A licensee shall not attach its guy wires to DED's anchors without prior written permission of the DED. If permission is granted, charges may apply. 
(d)  Allocation of costs. The costs for any rearrangement or transfer of a licensee's attachments or the modification or replacement of a pole (including any related costs for tree cutting or trimming required to clear the new location of DED's cables or wires) or conduit shall be allocated to DED and/or the licensee and/or other attaching entities on the following basis: 
(i)  If DED intends to modify or replace a pole or conduit solely for its own requirements, it shall be responsible for the costs related to the modification/replacement of the pole or conduit. The licensee(s), however, shall be responsible for all costs associated with the rearrangement or transfer of licensee's attachments. Prior to making any such modification or replacement DED shall provide the licensee(s) written notification of its intent in order to allow the licensee(s) a reasonable opportunity to elect to modify or add to its existing attachment(s). Should the licensee so elect, it must seek DED's written permission. The notification requirement of this subparagraph (d) shall not apply to routine maintenance or emergency situations. If a licensee elects to add to or modify its attachments, the licensee shall bear the total incremental costs incurred by DED in making the space on the poles or conduits accessible to the licensee. 
(ii)  If the modification or the replacement of a pole is the result of an additional attachment or the modification of an existing attachment sought by an attaching entity other than DED or licensee, the attaching entity requesting the additional or modified attachment shall bear the entire cost of the modification or pole replacement, as well as the costs for rearranging or transferring the licensee's attachments. Each licensee shall cooperate with such third party attaching entity to determine the costs of moving the licensee's facilities. 
(iii)  If a pole or conduit must be modified or replaced for other reasons unrelated to the use of the pole or conduit by any attaching entities (e.g., storm, accident, deterioration), DED shall pay the costs of such modification or replacement; provided however, that every licensee shall be responsible for the costs of rearranging or transferring its own attachments. 
(e)  Nondiscrimination. No provision of this agreement shall be construed to require DED to relocate its attachments or modify/replace its poles or conduits for the benefit of a particular licensee; provided, however, any denial by DED shall be based on nondiscriminatory standards of general applicability. 
(12)  Abandonment or removal of DED facilities. 
(a)  Notice of abandonment or removal of DED facilities. If DED desires at any time to abandon or remove any of its poles or other facilities to which a licensee's facilities are attached, it shall give the licensee notice in writing to that effect at least 60 calendar days prior to the date on which it intends to abandon or remove such facilities. Notice may be limited to 30 calendar days if DED is required to remove or abandon its facilities as the result of the action of a third party and a greater notice period is not practical. Such notice shall indicate whether DED is offering the licensee utility an option to purchase the pole(s). If, following the expiration of said period, licensee has not yet removed and/or transferred all of its facilities and has not entered into an agreement to purchase DED's poles or other facilities pursuant to subsection (b), DED shall have the right, subject to any applicable laws and regulations, to have the licensee's facilities removed and/or transferred from the pole at the licensee's expense. DED shall give a licensee 60 days prior written notice of any such removal or transfer of licensee's facilities. 
(b)  Option to purchase abandoned poles. Should DED desire to abandon any pole, DED, in its sole discretion, may grant a licensee the option of purchasing such pole at a rate as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. The depreciation life of a pole is 30 years. If a pole that is to be purchased is older than 30 years, then the rate to be charged is set as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. A licensee must notify DED in writing within 30 calendar days of the date of DED's notice of abandonment that licensee desires to purchase the abandoned pole. Thereafter, licensee must also secure and deliver proof of all necessary governmental approvals and easements allowing licensee to independently own and access the pole within 60 calendar days. Should licensee fail to secure the necessary governmental approvals, or should DED and licensee fail to enter into an agreement for licensee to purchase the pole prior to the end of the 60 calendar days, licensee must remove its attachments as required under subsection (a). 
(13)  Removal of licensee's attachments-Removal on termination. At the termination of an agreement, licensee shall remove its attachments from the affected DED facilities at its own expense. If a licensee fails to remove such attachments within 180 calendar days of termination or some greater period approved by DED, DED shall have the right to remove or cause such facilities to be removed at the licensee's expense. 
(14)  Termination of permit. 
(a)  Automatic termination of permit. Any permit issued pursuant to a license agreement shall automatically terminate when licensee ceases to have authority to construct and operate its communications facilities on public or private property at the location of the particular poles or conduits covered by the permit. Notwithstanding the forgoing, a licensee shall have the right to contest any such expiration or denial of authority before any of its rights are terminated under the agreement provided that the licensee shall indemnify DED for any actual damages that may result during licensee's challenge. 
(b)  Surrender of permit. A licensee may at any time surrender a permit and remove its attachments. Before commencing any such removal, the licensee must provide DED with written notice of licensee's plans for removal; including the name of the party performing such work and the date(s) and time(s) during which such work will be completed. All such work is subject to the insurance requirements of this section. No refund of any fees or costs will be made upon removal. If a Licensee surrenders a Permit but fails to remove its Attachments from DED's facilities within thirty (30) calendar days after the surrender, DED shall have the right to cause removal of licensee's attachments at licensee's expense. 
(15)  Inspection of licensee's facilities. 
(a)  Inspection. DED shall have the right at any time to make periodic inspections of a licensee's facilities, utilizing its employees and/or contractors at the sole expense of DED, unless prior agreement has been reached between DED and licensee(s). 
(b)  Notice. DED shall give a licensee reasonable advance written notice of such inspections, except in those instances where safety considerations justify the need for such inspection without the delay of waiting until written notice has been received. 
(c)  Duty of full compliance. Each licensee shall to bring its attachments into full compliance with this section and any applicable agreement within 30 calendar days of receipt of written notice in the event that any inspection results in a finding by DED that the licensee is not in compliance with this section or applicable agreement. Licensees shall be responsible for the costs of bringing attachments into compliance unless it can demonstrate that the noncompliance is the result of DED or a third-party attaching entity and not the result of the licensee's actions. 
(d)  No liability. The making of any inspections under this subsection, or the failure to do so, shall not operate to impose upon DED any liability of any kind whatsoever or relieve licensee of any responsibility, obligations or liability whether assumed under this Agreement or otherwise existing. 
(16)  Unauthorized occupancy or access. 
(a)  Penalty fee. If any attachments are found occupying DED facilities for which no permit has been issued (unless specifically exempted under subsection (8)) and such unauthorized attachment occurred after the effective date of this section, DED, without prejudice to any other rights it may have, may assess an unauthorized access penalty fee as specified in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. In the event a licensee fails to pay such fee within 30 calendar days of receiving notification thereof, DED has the right to remove such attachments at licensee's expense, unless such fee is disputed in good faith. 
(b)  Service drop exclusion. Service drops on DED's poles will not be considered unauthorized attachments when discovered. 
(c)  No ratification of unlicensed use. No act or failure to act by DED with regard to any unlicensed use shall be deemed to be a ratification of the unlicensed use. If a permit should subsequently be issued, such permit shall not, unless it expressly states otherwise, operate retroactively or constitute a waiver of any of DED's rights or privileges. 
(17)  Advance payment. At its sole discretion, DED shall have the right to demand that a licensee make an advance payment for each attachment in the amount of the annual attachment fee as specified in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. 
(18)  Liability and indemnification. 
(a)  Liability. DED reserves to itself the right to maintain and operate its facilities in such manner as will best enable it to fulfill its service requirements. A licensee's use of DED's facilities is at the licensee's sole risk. Notwithstanding the foregoing, DED shall exercise reasonable precaution to avoid damaging the communications facilities or electric facilities of licensees and shall report to licensee any such damage caused by DED's employees, agents or contractors. DED shall reimburse a licensee for all reasonable costs incurred by licensee for the physical repair of facilities damaged by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of DED; provided, however, that the aggregate liability of DED to a licensee in any fiscal year, for any fines, penalties, claims or damages (including special, indirect, punitive, or consequential damages) stemming from interruption of licensee's service or from DED's interference with the operation of licensee's communications facilities or electric facilities, shall not exceed the total annual attachment fee paid by the licensee to DED for that year, as calculated based on the number of attachments under permit at the time of the damage. 
(b)  Indemnification. Every licensee (including, but not limited to, its agents, contractors and subcontractors) shall defend, indemnify and hold DED (including but not limited to its officials, officers, board members, council members, commissioners, representatives, employees, agents, contractors and subcontractors) harmless from any and all liability, costs, damages, fines, taxes, special charges by others, penalties, payments (including payments made by DED under any workers' compensation laws or under any plan for employees' disability and death benefits), and expenses (including DED's reasonable attorney fees and other expenses of litigation) ("covered claims") arising in any way, including any act, omission, failure, negligence or misconduct, in connection with the construction, maintenance, repair, presence, use, relocation, transfer, removal or operation by the licensee, or by licensee's officers, directors, employees, agents, and contractors, of licensee's communications facilities or electric facilities, except to the extent that DED's gross negligence or willful misconduct gave rise to such covered claims. Such covered claims include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(i)  Infringement of intellectual property, libel and slander, trespass, and unauthorized use of television or radio broadcast programs and other program material; 
(ii)  Cost of work performed by DED that was necessitated by licensee's failure, or the failure of licensee's officers, directors, employees, agents, or contractors, to install, maintain, present, use, transfer or remove licensee's attachments in accordance with the requirements and specifications of this section or an associated license agreement, or from any other work this section or an associate license agreement authorizes DED to perform on licensee's behalf; 
(iii)  Damage to property, injury, or death of any person arising out of the performance or nonperformance of any work or obligation undertaken by licensee, or licensee's officers, directors, employees, agents, and contractors, pursuant to this section or associated agreement; 
(iv)  Liabilities incurred as a result of a violation by a licensee or its officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors and subcontractors, of any law, rule, or regulation of the United States, state, city, or any other governmental entity or administrative agency. 
(c)  Procedure for indemnification. 
(i)  DED shall promptly give a licensee notice of any claim or threatened claim, specifying the factual basis for such claim and the amount of the claim. If the claim relates to an action, suit or proceeding filed by a third party against DED, DED shall endeavor to give notice to licensee no later than ten calendar days after DED receives written notice of the action, suit or proceeding. 
(ii)  DED's failure to give the required notice within ten calendar days shall not relieve the licensee of its obligation to indemnify DED unless the licensee is materially prejudiced by such failure. 
(iii)  A licensee shall have the right at any time, by notice to DED, to participate in or assume control of the defense of the claim. The licensee may utilize counsel of its choice subject to DED's approval, which DED shall not unreasonably withhold. DED shall cooperate fully with the licensee. If the licensee assumes control of the defense of any third-party claim, DED shall have the right to participate in the defense at its own expense. If the licensee does not assume control or otherwise participate in the defense of a third-party claim, it shall be bound by the results obtained by DED. 
(iv)  If a licensee assumes the defense of a third-party claim as described above, DED shall not assume liability for or settle, compromise or discharge any third-party claim without the licensee's prior written consent, and DED will agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of any third-party claim recommended by the Licensee that releases the DED completely from such claim and does not establish a precedent that may adversely affect DED in the future. 
(d)  Environmental hazards. As a condition to a licensee's use of DED's facilities, the licensee shall represent or warrant, or be deemed to have represented and warranted, that it will comply with all federal, state and local environmental laws in its use of DED's facilities and that it will not generate, store, dispose of, or transport hazardous substances on or about DED's facilities. The term "hazardous substance" shall be interpreted broadly to mean any substance or material designated or defined as hazardous or toxic by any federal, state, or local law, regulation or rule now or hereafter in effect including any amendments. Each licensee further shall represent and warrant, or be deemed to have represented or warranted, that in the event of breakage, leakage, incineration or other release, its communications facilities or electric facilities will not contribute to the dissemination or [of] hazardous or toxic materials. Every licensee (including, but not limited to, its agents, contractors and subcontractors) shall defend, indemnify and hold DED (including, but not limited to, its officials, officers, board members, council members, commissioners, representatives, employees, agents, contractors and subcontractors) harmless from any and all liability, costs, damages, fines, taxes, special charges by others, penalties, payments (including payments made by DED under any workers' compensation laws or under any plan for employees' disability and death benefits), and expenses (including DED's reasonable attorney fees and other expenses of litigation) arising from or due to the release, storage or discovery of any such hazardous or toxic materials on, under or adjacent to DED's facilities attributable to the licensee's facilities. 
(e)  Hazardous poles or conduits. Should DED's poles or conduits be declared hazardous, then DED, licensee and all attaching entities shall share in the cost of disposal of said poles based on their proportionate use of the poles or conduits. For attaching entities such percentage shall be derived from the sum of assigned space occupied by each attaching entity plus its share of the common space. For DED, such percentage shall be equal to the space above the NESC 40-inch safety space plus its share of the common space. However, if the joint use agreement with the local telephone company does not include this clause this paragraph shall be null and void. 
If a hazardous condition is caused by particular parties, all resulting costs shall be borne solely by such parties. 
(f)  Municipal liability limits. No provision of this chapter [section] or any associated license agreement is intended, nor shall it be construed, to waive applicable state immunity or limits on the city's or DED's liability. No indemnification provision contained in an agreement under which a licensee indemnifies DED shall be construed in any way to limit any other indemnification provision contained in this chapter or in any associated license agreement. 
(19)  Duties, responsibilities and exculpation. 
(a)  Duty to inspect. Prior to making attachment to any DED facilities, every licensee shall agree, or be deemed to have agreed, that DED does not warrant the condition or safety of DED's facilities, or the premises or property surrounding the facilities. Each licensee shall further agree, or be deemed to have agreed, that it has an obligation to inspect DED's facilities and the premises surrounding the facilities prior to commencing any work on DED's facilities or entering the premises surrounding the facilities. 
(b)  Knowledge of work conditions. Every licensee executing a license agreement shall warrant that it has acquainted, or will fully acquaint, itself and its employees, agents, contractors and subcontractors, with the conditions relating to the work that licensee or they will undertake under this section and the associated license agreement and that it and they fully understand, or will acquaint themselves, with the facilities, difficulties, and restrictions attending the execution of such work. 
(c)  Disclaimer. By making its facilities available for attachments, DED makes no express or implied warranties with regard to DED's poles or conduits, and DED makes no other express or implied warranties, except to the extent expressly and unambiguously set forth in the individual license agreements. DED further expressly disclaims any and all implied warranties, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose. 
(d)  Duty to conduct competent supervision and performance. By executing a license agreement, every licensee acknowledges, or is deemed to have acknowledged, that in performing its work, the licensee and its agents, servants, employees, contractors and subcontractors will work near electrically energized lines, transformers, or other DED facilities, and that the parties intend that energy therein will not be interrupted during such work, except in an emergency endangering life, grave personal injury, or property. Every licensee shall ensure that its employees, servants, agents, contractors and subcontractors have the necessary qualifications, skill, knowledge, training, and experience to protect themselves, their fellow employees, employees of DED, and the general public, from harm or injury while performing work permitted pursuant to this section and associated agreements. Each licensee shall furnish its employees, servants, agents, contractors and subcontractors competent supervision and sufficient and adequate tools and equipment for their work to be performed in a safe manner. Each licensee shall agree that in emergency situations in which it may be necessary to de-energize any part of DED's equipment, the licensee shall ensure that work is suspended until the equipment has been de-energized and that no such work will be conducted unless and until the equipment is made safe. 
(e)  Requests to de-energize. In the event that DED de-energizes any equipment or line at a licensee's request or for its benefit and convenience, the licensee shall reimburse DED for all its resulting costs and expenses. Before DED de-energizes any equipment or line, it shall provide, upon a licensee's request, an estimate of all costs and expenses to be incurred in accommodating the licensee's request. 
(f)  Interruption of service. In the event that a licensee causes an interruption of service by damaging or interfering with any equipment of DED, the licensee, at its expense, shall immediately do all things reasonable to avoid any resulting injury or damages, direct and incidental, and shall immediately notify DED. 
(g)  Duty to inform. As a condition to obtaining a License Agreement, every Licensee shall warrant that it understands the imminent dangers (including serious bodily injury or death from electrocution) inherent in the work necessary to make installations on and around DED's facilities by the licensee's employees, servants, agents, contractors or subcontractors, and that licensee accepts as the duty and sole responsibility to inform its employees, servants, agents, contractors or subcontractors of such dangers and to keep them informed regarding same. 
(20)  Insurance and bonding. Each licensee shall maintain reasonable bonds and insurance throughout the term of its license agreement in amounts sufficient to ensure licensee's obligations under the license agreement and in a manner as set forth in its license agreement. 
(21)  Assignment. 
a.  Limitations on assignment. A licensee may not assign its rights or obligations under a license agreement adopted pursuant to this section without the prior written consent of DED, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a licensee may assign or transfer its interest in a license agreement to an affiliate of the licensee without DED's consent, provided that the licensee furnishes to DED a guarantee that DED, in its sole discretion, finds acceptable. 
b.  Obligations of assignee/transferee and licensee. No assignment or transfer of a license agreement shall be allowed until the assignee or transferee becomes a signatory to the license agreement and assumes all obligations of the licensee arising under the license agreement. 
c.  Sublicensing. Without DED's prior written consent, a licensee shall not sublicense space on DED's Facilities or allow a third party to make direct attachments to DED's facilities or overlash the licensee's facilities. The use of licensee's facilities by third parties (including, but not limited to, leases of fiber within licensee's sheaths or conduits) that involves no additional attachment or overlashing is not subject to the prohibitions of this paragraph. 
(22)  Termination. 
(a)  DED shall have the right, pursuant to the procedure set forth in paragraph (b) below, to terminate a license agreement adopted pursuant to this section, or any permit issued thereunder, whenever a licensee is in default of any material term or condition of this section or of an associated license agreement, including, but not limited to, the following circumstances: 
(i)  Construction, operation or maintenance of licensee's communications facilities or electric facilities in violation of law or in aid of any unlawful act or undertaking; or 
(ii)  Construction, operation or maintenance of licensee's communications facilities in violation of any other agreement with DED; or 
(iii)  Construction, operation or maintenance of licensee's communications facilities after any authorization required of licensee has been lawfully denied or revoked by any governmental authority or private person; or 
(iv)  Construction, operation or maintenance of licensee's communications facilities without the insurance coverage required under the agreement. 
(b)  Upon receiving a written notice of default, a licensee shall correct the default within 30 calendar days or such longer period as DED in its sole discretion may grant in writing. When the default is corrected, the licensee shall confirm this in writing to DED. If the licensee fails to discontinue or correct a default within the prescribed period or fails to give the required confirmation, DED may immediately terminate the license agreement, any permit(s) issued under it, or both. 
(23)  Notification of parties prior to change in section. Parties subject to this section will be provided written notice 15 days prior to a city committee or city council consideration of modifications of the section.

Sec. 110-206. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Equivalent dwelling unit (EDU): A term used to express the load produced on a water system approximately equal to one dwelling unit or 250 gallons per day (GPD). 
    Impact fee: A one-time fee imposed by the city upon the owner(s) of any new, remodeled, restored or enlarged residential, commercial, institutional or industrial structure or structures or any combination thereof which results in an increased water demand to the water system. 
    Water system: A term used to collectively identify all production, transmission and distribution facilities and/or improvements associated with the infrastructure. 
(Ord. of 1-28-2008(2)) 
Sec. 110-207. - Establishment of equivalent dwelling units. 
(a)  Determination for residential dwellings. Whenever by ordinance or by contract the city imposes or assesses water charges or fees on the basis of EDUs, an EDU shall be determined in the same manner as wastewater collection charges or fees and as defined in the most recent impact fee ordinance adopted by Kent County Levy Court. An EDU for a residential dwelling shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  Houses, dwellings, mobile homes, manufactured homes, and apartments with one kitchen and one or more baths and bedrooms separate from the kitchen ..... 1.0 EDU 
(2)  Efficiency unit or cottage having a living space in one room and having one bath ..... 1.0 EDU 
(3)  Dwelling with one kitchen and one or more baths and bedrooms separate from the kitchen and attached to other dwellings or structures ..... 1.0 EDU 
(b)  Determination for nonresidential establishments. Whenever by ordinance or by contract the city imposes or assesses water charges or fees on the basis of EDUs, the number of EDUs to be charged shall be determined in the same manner as wastewater collection charges or fees and using the appropriate specific assessment as defined in the most recent impact fee ordinance adopted by Kent County Levy Court. When users propose water usage under circumstances other than the specific assessments defined by the county, the city's impact fee shall be calculated by the city engineer based on flow in GPD. In such cases where the impact fee is calculated by flow, each EDU shall be equal to 250 GPD. 
(c)  Minimum assignment. A minimum of one EDU will be assigned to each establishment connecting to the system. No fractional parts of EDUs will be assigned. The number of EDUs shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number of EDUs. 
(d)  No assignment. If an establishment does not have any physical facilities which result in a water demand on the city's water system, then the number of EDUs assigned to it shall be zero. 
(e)  Maximum assignment. For projects that have a significant impact on the city's utility, city council may consider a maximum assignment of EDUs. A project will be considered to have a significant impact if it will contribute in excess of 100 EDUs. In these cases, city council may reduce the number of assigned EDUs to as low as 100 EDUs if an economic benefit to the City of Dover is demonstrated. Any request that will contribute less than 100 EDUs will not be eligible for a reduction. Maximum assignment of EDUs in excess of 100 EDUs will only apply to projects or connections with building permits issued after July 28, 2014. Any project with a building permit issued prior to July 28, 2014, will be subject to a maximum assignment of no more than 100 EDUs. 
(Ord. of 1-28-2008(2); Ord. No. 2014-15, 7-28-2014 ; Ord. No. 2016-16 , 8-8-2016) 
Sec. 110-208. - Water impact fee established; payment, credits. 
(a)  Findings, etc. It is hereby determined that additional users to be connected to, or additional demand to be placed upon, the city's water system will cause a reduction in the presently existing excess capacity and will eventually contribute to the need to expand the city's water production and distribution system. Such users resulting in new connections or increased demand should contribute capital to be used for the expansion of the city's water production and distribution system. The city's engineers have determined that the calculation methods and procedures utilized to determine wastewater collection impact fees as provided in the most recent impact fee ordinance adopted by Kent County Levy Court will be used to establish water impact fees based on the number of EDUs. A copy of this ordinance is on file with the city. A comprehensive study of the city's water production and distribution system was completed and a master plan developed for the orderly expansion of the city's water production and distribution system (Whitman, Requardt and Associates, "City of Dover, Delaware, Water System Master Plan," January 2006). It is in the best interest of the city and users of the city's production and distribution system to establish an impact fee. A study of the city's production and distribution system will be conducted as needed and the master plan updated accordingly, but not more frequently than every five years. 
(b)  Payment. Every additional user to be connected to, or additional demand to be place upon, the city's water system, whether within the city's boundaries or outside the city's boundaries, and receiving service through contract directly with the city, shall pay an impact fee based on the amount of EDUs to be generated by such use. Commercial users, at the time of plan submittal, must submit their proposed fixture unit schedule for the construction. The purpose of the impact fee and the standard by which its amount is determined is as a contribution of capital toward the expansion of the city's water system. The impact fee shall be adjusted from time to time to reflect changing costs and it shall be in addition to all other charges and assessments made in connection with the furnishing of water service. The amount of the water impact fee shall be as adopted by the city council, and such amount shall be kept in a separate, interest-earning expansion account and shall be used only for costs associated with the expansion of the city's water system. This impact fee shall be in addition to any assessment, tapping fee or other costs associated with providing service. Impact fees are to be paid by all developers or owners of newly constructed structures or enlarged/improved existing structures requiring water service prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. The city reserves the right to bar occupancy of such structure and withhold water service until such time as the aforementioned fee is paid in full. 
(c)  Fee and applicability. 
(1)  The impact fee shall be as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines beginning on February 1, 2008, for every additional user or additional demand to be placed on the system where both the applicable building permit and certificate of occupancy is issued on or after February 1, 2008. Additional users or additional demands issued an applicable building permit before February 1, 2008, shall not pay the fee. A sales contract executed prior to February 1, 2008, for the sale of the applicable property to a buyer who is independent of the seller may be submitted to the city manager for consideration in lieu of a building permit issued before February 1, 2008. 
(2)  The impact fee shall be as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines beginning on February 1, 2009, for every additional user or additional demand to be placed on the system where a certificate of occupancy is issued after February 1, 2009. 
(3)  The impact fee shall be as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines beginning on February 1, 2010, for every additional users or additional demand to be placed on the system where a certificate of occupancy is issued after February 1, 2010. 
(4)  The impact fee shall be adjusted from time to time to reflect changing costs as a result of study of the city's water system that will be conducted as needed, but not more frequently than every five years. 
(d)  EDU credit. Any connection to the city's water system will be credited with any EDUs existing on the property. As an example, if a house with an EDU is demolished and a structure with 50 EDUs is put in its place, the owner shall pay a water impact fee based on 49 EDUs. No EDUs shall be transferred from one property to another property, whether or not such properties are owned by the same person, without the approval of the city council. 
(e)  Deferred charge. All applicants for service, which have been served by private water sources, shall be subject to a deferred impact fee charge. Payment of the deferred impact fee charge shall not be required until such time as connection is made directly to the city's water system. The amount of the charge shall be based on the prevailing impact fee at the time of connection. This fee shall be in addition to any assessment, tapping fee or other costs associated with providing service.

In these cases, city council may reduce the number of assigned EDUs to as low as 100 EDUs if an economic benefit to the City of Dover is demonstrated. Any request that will contribute less than 100 EDUs will not be eligible for a reduction. Maximum assignment of EDUs in excess of 100 EDUs will only apply to projects or connections with building permits issued after July 28, 2014. Any project with a building permit issued prior to July 28, 2014, will be subject to a maximum assignment of no more than 100 EDUs.

Sec. 110-283. - Wastewater collection and transmission impact fee established; payment, credits. 
(a)  Findings, etc. It is hereby determined that additional users to be connected to the city wastewater collection and transmission system will cause a reduction in presently existing excess capacity and will eventually contribute to the need to expand the city's wastewater collection and transmission system. Such additional users should contribute capital to be used for the expansion of the city's wastewater collection and transmission system. The city's engineers have determined that the calculation methods and procedures in the most recent impact fee ordinance adopted by the Levy Court of the county will be used to establish wastewater collection and transmission impact fees for additional users based on the number of EDUs. A copy of this ordinance is on file with the city. A comprehensive study of the city's wastewater collection and transmission system was completed and a master plan developed for the orderly expansion of the city's wastewater collection and transmission system (Whitman, Requardt and Associates, "City of Dover, Delaware, Wastewater System Master Plan," July 1987). It is in the best interest of the city and users of the city's wastewater collection system to establish an impact fee. A study of the city's wastewater collection and transmission system will be conducted as needed and the master plan updated accordingly, but not more frequently than every five years. 
(b)  Payment. Every additional user to be connected to the city's wastewater collection and transmission system, whether within the city's boundaries or outside the city's boundaries, and receiving service through contract directly with the city, shall pay an impact fee based on the amount of EDUs to be generated by such use. Commercial users, at the time of plan submittal, must submit their proposed fixture unit schedule for the construction. The purpose of the impact fee and the standard by which its amount is determined is as a contribution of capital toward the expansion of the city's wastewater collection and transmission system. The impact fee shall be adjusted from time to time to reflect changing costs and it shall be in addition to all other charges and assessments made in connection with the furnishing of wastewater collection and transmission service. The amount of the wastewater collection and transmission impact fee shall be as adopted by the city council, and such amount shall be kept in a separate, interest-earning expansion account and shall be used only for costs associated with the expansion of the city's wastewater collection and transmission system. This impact fee shall be in addition to any assessment or tapping fee. 
(c)  EDU credit. Any connection to the city's wastewater collection and transmission system will be credited with any EDUs existing on the property. As an example, if a house with an EDU is demolished and a structure with 50 EDUs is put in its place, the owner shall pay a sewer impact fee based on 49 EDUs. No EDUs shall be transferred from one property to another property, whether or not such properties are owned by the same person, without the approval of the city council. 
(d)  Deferred charge. All applicants for service, which have been served by either private individual wastewater disposal systems or private wastewater treatment plants, shall be subject to a deferred impact fee charge. Payment of the deferred impact fee charge shall not be required until such time as connection is made directly to the city's wastewater collection and transmission system. The amount of the charge shall be based on the prevailing impact fee at the time of connection. This fee shall be in addition to any assessment to the tapping fee.

(h)  Care upon public grounds. The city shall have the right to plant, prune, maintain and remove trees, plants and shrubs within the lines of all streets, alleys and public grounds as may be necessary to ensure public safety or to preserve or enhance the symmetry and beauty of such public grounds.

APPENDIX A - SUBDIVISIONS[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Appendix A contains the city's land subdivision regulations as readopted with amendments June 18, 1984, and approved June 25, 1984. Formerly, App. A contained the city's land subdivision regulations as recompiled and readopted Oct. 24, 1966, and as amended by ordinances of Aug. 24, 1971 and Sept. 27, 1971. Absence of a history note following a particular section indicates that the section derives unchanged from such regulations as readopted June 18, 1984; conversely, a history note enclosed in parentheses following a particular section indicates amendment by legislation shown in such history note. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made uniform and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

(Ord. of 2-14-2005) 
ARTICLE IV. - SUBDIVISION-PROCEDURE 

A. - Preapplication. 
1.  Prior to filing an application for conditional subdivision approval, the subdivider shall meet, in person, with the city planner, or his/her designee, to discuss the proposed subdivision and the required steps associated with the review process and to determine whether or not the plan is a major subdivision, minor subdivision or whether the plan merely represents a minor lot line adjustment. Plans limited to minor lot line adjustments may be approved for recordation by the city planner, or his/her designee, after review and determination of compliance with all applicable zoning and subdivision regulations. 
2.  Following this step, the subdivider shall submit to the commission preapplication plans and data as specified in article V, section A, with a filing fee as provided for Appendix F-Fees and Fines. 
3.  Prior to the review of the preapplication, the commission shall hold a public hearing to be advertised by the applicant in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten days prior thereto. The applicant shall notify, by mail, all property owners within 200 feet of the extreme limits of the subdivision, as their names appear on the municipal tax record, at least ten days prior thereto. The applicant shall provide the commission with a copy of the notice, verification of newspaper publication, and post office return receipts for all letters on or before the meeting date. Said notices shall state the time and place of the hearing, a brief description of the subdivision and that a copy of the subdivision application and plan is filed with the department of planning and inspections for public review. 
4.  Within five days after the next regularly scheduled meeting of the commission following said preapplication, the commission shall notify the subdivider whether his proposal is classified as a minor subdivision and that the plans and data, as submitted, do or do not meet the objectives of these regulations, and if not, it shall state its reason therefor. Minor subdivisions shall be designated by a majority vote of the commission and shall only include subdivisions where no improvements, dedications or easements are required. If, in the opinion of the commission, the character of the subdivision (by reason of size or design) so warrants, it may hold a public hearing on the preapplication, with notice to be given substantially in accordance with subparagraph [subsection] 4. of this article. 
(Ord. of 6-24-1991; Ord. of 10-13-1992; Ord. of 4-25-1994; Ord. of 7-12-2004(2); Ord. No. 2009-09, 6-22-2009) 
B. - Preliminary layout. 
1.  A preliminary layout and other documents, as specified in article V, shall be prepared by the subdivider in accordance with the general requirements and design standards specified in article VI, and conforming to the conclusions reached by the commission with respect to the preapplication plan above. 
2.  Application for conditional approval of the preliminary layout shall be submitted in writing with a filing fee as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines by the subdivider to the commission, together with the original and 20 prints of the preliminary layout, and other specified documents at least 30 days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. 
3.  Since the provision of some public facilities and utilities are the responsibility of special districts, governments, boards, agencies or utility companies, the commission or their [sic] representative shall direct the referral of proposed subdivision layouts to such agencies as may be involved. Distribution may include the following: 
(1)  The director of state division of highways. 
(2)  Affected school districts. 
(3)  City fire department. 
(4)  Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, and Dover City Board of Health. 
(5)  U.S. Postal Service cluster mailbox location. 
(6)  Other agencies or jurisdictions involved. 
4.  Prior to the review and action on the preliminary layout application, the commission shall hold a public hearing to be advertised by the applicant in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten days prior thereto. The applicant shall notify by mail all property owners within 200 feet of the extreme limits of the subdivision as their names appear on the municipal tax record at least ten days prior thereto. The applicant shall provide the commission with a copy of the notice, verification of newspaper publication, and post office return receipts for all letters on or before the meeting date. Said notices shall state the time and place of the hearing, a brief description of the subdivision and shall state that a copy of the subdivision application and plan is filed with the planning department [department of planning and inspections] for public review. 
5.  The commission shall, within 45 days from the date of the submission of the preliminary layout or within such additional time as may be consented to by the applicant, act on said layout as submitted or modified, and, within five days, shall notify the subdivider in writing of its decision, and state the conditions of approval if any, the suggested modification if any, or the reason for disapproval of the layout. Approval of the preliminary layout by the commission shall be expressed as conditional approval. 
6.  Any condition required by the city planner shall be noted on the original and a print of the preliminary layout. The chairman of the planning commission and the city planner shall sign the original and print as approved by the city planner. The print shall be retained by the city planner and the original shall be returned to the subdivider, who shall deliver two prints of the signed original to the city planner. 
7.  Conditional approval of the preliminary layout shall not constitute approval of any subsequent plat, rather it is an expression of approval of the general design submitted to be used as a guide to the preparation of the plan to be submitted to the commission for its approval. For the protection of the subdivider, it is stressed that the commission's approval of the preliminary layout shall be secured before undertaking of final surveys of streets and lots and final construction plans, and that the start of any grading or street construction work must await approval by the commission of the plat and of a grading plan. However, in the case of minor subdivisions, approval of the preliminary layout shall be equivalent to final approval and the subdivider shall follow procedures set forth in paragraphs [section] C.7., C.8. and C.9. of this article. 
(Ord. of 6-24-1991; Ord. of 10-13-1992; Ord. of 4-25-1994; Ord. of 1-10-1996; Ord. of 7-12-2004(2); Ord. No. 2009-09, 6-22-2009) 
C. - Plat.

(e)  Under no circumstances shall the planning commission grant extensions beyond six months from the date of first approval. 
3.  Application for approval of the plat shall be submitted in writing by the subdivider to the city planner, together with three prints of the plat and the plat review fee as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. 
4.  Within 45 days from the date of submission of the plat or within such additional time as may be consented to by the applicant, the city planner shall approve or disapprove said plat, and shall notify the subdivider in writing of the decision and state the conditions of approval if any, the required modifications if any, or the reasons for disapproval. Approval of the plat shall not become final until the provisions of paragraphs [subsections] 5. and 6. below have been complied with. 
5.  When all improvements are completed to the satisfaction of the city manager and when the subdivider makes an application for dedication of streets and other public areas and easements, such application shall be accompanied by a maintenance bond in the amount of ten percent of the cost of all public improvements, upon the advice of the city manager, to be adequate to assure the satisfactory condition of the initial improvements for a period of at least one year following their completion and to remain valid until certificates of occupancy have been issued and/or property transfers have occurred for at least 75 percent of the lots within the subdivision. Such bond shall be satisfactory to the city solicitor with regard to form, sufficiency, manner of execution and surety. 
6.  The approved plat shall be filed and recorded in the county recorder of deeds' office within 90 days from the date of final approval by the city planner; otherwise, said approval shall become null and void, unless an extension of time is applied for, and granted by the city planner within the said 90-day period.

ARTICLE VI. - SUBDIVISION-GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN STANDARDS 
    The following shall be deemed to be minimum requirements and shall be varied or waived by the commission only under circumstances set forth in article VII, section A. 

A. - Streets. 
1.  The layout, character, extent, width, grade and location of proposed streets shall be established with due regard to: 
(a)  Public convenience and safety. 
(b)  Proposed uses of the land to be served by said streets. 
(c)  Proper relation and connection with, continuation and projection of streets to adjacent areas; whether these streets are existing, or proposed in another subdivision, in a neighborhood plan, in the development plan, or in the official map, as approved or adopted by the commission. Where existing or proposed streets are located on adjacent land, then the planning commission shall require street extensions at points in which the commission determines are suitable for future connections to adjacent developable lands on each side of the development. 
(d)  Topography and other land features. 
(e)  Speed reduction devices on any city or private street, drive, parking lot, or any other driveable surface, which causes a change in elevation which may result in emergency equipment having to reduce speed during a time of emergency, is prohibited. Speed cushions may be installed on privately owned commercial property, in accordance with Chapter 98-Streets, Sidewalks, Storm Sewers and Other Public Places, Article I.-In General, section 98-10-Speed Reduction Devices. 
2.  The layout of proposed streets shall furthermore be arranged in a manner acceptable to the commission so that vehicle safety, pedestrian convenience, emergency vehicle access, and ease of traffic flow for private vehicles and public service delivery vehicles is accomplished. 
3.  Minor streets shall be laid out so as to discourage their use by through traffic. 
4.  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, limited access highway or railroad, the commission may require marginal access or service streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or other treatment, such as parks, which may be necessary for protection of residential properties and for separation of through and local traffic with due regard for the requirements of future approach grades and separations. 
5.  Where a tract of land is subdivided into lots substantially larger than the minimum size required in the zoning district in which a subdivision is located, the commission may require that streets and lots be laid out so as to permit future resubdivision in accordance with the requirements of these regulations. 
6.  Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where the control and disposal of land comprising such strips has been placed in the governing body under conditions approved by the planning commission such as provided in paragraph [subsection] 4. above. 
7.  Certain proposed streets may be required to be extended to the boundary line of the subdivision to provide access to tracts which may be subdivided in the future. Wherever necessary, when a street is carried to the boundary line of the subdivision, the commission may require a temporary turnaround improved to the satisfaction of the city manager and of the size specified in paragraph [subsection] 15. below at the stub end. 
8.  The creation of interconnected streets will be encouraged wherever the commission finds that such layout will not interfere with traffic convenience and safety. The commission shall determine the number of connections of streets in the proposed subdivision with existing streets. At least two connections onto a state-maintained road or a city-maintained street are required unless the Delaware Department of Transportation or the city engineer determines that the second connection will not be permitted or is determined to be nonfeasible. This requirement shall pertain to: 
(a)  Subdivisions containing 20 or more lots, plots, sites, or parcels. 
(b)  Site developments containing 150 or more dwelling units. 
9.  Street jogs shall be prohibited. Street intersections, where centerlines do not meet, shall have centerline offsets of 150 feet or more. 
10.  Street right-of-way lines deflecting from each other at any point shall be connected with a curve, the radius of which, for the centerline of the right-of-way, shall not be less than 500 feet on arterial streets, 300 feet on collector streets and 150 feet on minor streets. The outer and inner right-of-way line shall be parallel to said center right-of-way line. 
11.  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. The inner right-of-way line of a street intersecting another street at an angle of less than 90 degrees shall be tangent to and follow a curve with a minimum radius of 150 feet centered on the nearest right-of-way line and shall be parallel to said inner right-of-way line. 
12.  Street rights-of-way lines at intersections shall be connected with a curve, the radius of which shall be at least 25 feet. The required radius may be increased by the city engineer if the increased radius is necessary for public safety. 
13.  Street rights-of-way and roadway shall be as shown on the official map or development plan and, if not shown thereon, said widths for the various street types, shall not be less than [as] follows: 
13.1  Rights-of-way and roadway widths for the various street types, with no on-street parking, shall not be less than as follows: 
Street Type Right-of-Way 
(feet) Roadway 
(feet) Arterial 80 to 110 60 to 80 Collector 60 38 Local for all residential areas 60 24 Local for commercial areas 60 26 Culs-de-sac and dead-ends 60 24 Marginal access 60 24 Alley, one-way 16 12  
13.2  The minimum roadway widths provided in [sub]section 13.1 are to be utilized on streets with no on-street parking. 
13.3  In areas where off-street parking does not exceed that required in appendix B and on all local commercial streets, roadway widths shall be increased by six feet for parking to be allowed on one side of the roadway and by 12 feet for parking to be allowed on both sides of the roadway. These street width requirements shall not be amended by any alternative street widths provided for in §13.4 or § 13.5 of this section. 
13.4  In areas where off-street parking does exceed that required in appendix B, but on-street parking is necessary or desired, roadway widths shall be increased by four feet for parking to be allowed on one side of the roadway and by ten feet for parking to be allowed on both sides of the roadway. 
13.5  In areas where off-street parking meets or exceeds that required in appendix B and rear access alleys are provided for parking and access to garages, roadway widths shall be increased by two feet for parking to be allowed on one side of the roadway and by eight feet for parking to be allowed on both sides of the roadway. 
13.6  Accommodations for off-street parking must exceed that required in appendix B, Articles 3, 4, 5 or 6, as applicable to take advantage of the street widths allowed in [subsection] 13.4 or 13.5 of this section. In residential subdivisions, off-street parking requirements must be increased by a minimum of one space per lot.

Section 22. - Airport environs overlay zone (AEOZ). 
22.1  Purpose and intent. The airport environs overlay zone (AEOZ) is expressly intended to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by identifying areas impacted by high levels of aircraft noise, and the potential for aircraft accidents associated with airport operations, by regulating land use and the construction of buildings within such areas. The AEOZ is further intended to preserve and promote the integrity of the mission of Dover Air Force Base (DAFB) as a matter of local, regional and national importance, by regulating development and land use within the specific areas surrounding DAFB, and to protect DAFB from encroachment of incompatible land uses. The AEOZ shall serve as an overlay zone that applies additional standards and requirements to properties located therein. 
(a)  The AEOZ is based on information provided by the Dover Air Force Base's Air Installation Compatible Use Zone Study Update. The city shall work with the Dover Air Force Base to update the provisions of this section as needed. 
(b)  In case of conflicting standards and requirements, the more stringent standards and requirements shall apply. Uses prohibited by the underlying zoning designations of the properties within the AEOZ shall not be permitted by this section. 
22.2  Definitions. 
(a)  Air installations compatible use zones (AICUZ): is a department of defense program to achieve compatibility between air installations and neighboring communities. 
(b)  Airport environs: is the geographic area that is affected by airport air traffic operations and defined on the basis of those areas immediately impacted by aircraft noise of the 65 decibels (dBs) and greater noise exposure areas as delineated by the current and approved DAFB air compatibility use zone study. This area is represented as the airport environs overlay zone (AEOZ). 
(c)  Day-night average A-weighted sound level (DNL): is a cumulative aircraft noise index which estimates the exposure to aircraft noise and relates the estimated exposure to an expected community response; a 24-hour energy average sound level expressed in decibels (dBs), with a ten-decibel penalty applied to noise occurring between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
(d)  DNL contour: is an isoline linking together a series of points of equal cumulative noise exposure based on Ldn metric. Such contours are developed based on aircraft flight patterns, number of daily aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day, noise characteristics of each aircraft, and typical runway usage patterns. 
(e)  Decibel (dB): is a unit of measure of sound pressure or intensity. 
(f)  Ldn metric: is the average equivalent A-weighted sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained by adding ten decibels to the hourly noise levels measured during the night (10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.). 
(g)  SLUCM: Standard Land Use Coding Manual, U.S. Department of Transportation. 
22.3  Accident potential zones and noise zones. The AEOZ is comprised of two basic regulatory components: accident potential zones and noise zones. This section establishes three accident potential zones and four noise zones. The boundaries of each of these zones are delineated on the City of Dover Zoning Map and are further described as follows: 
(a)  Accident potential zones: 
(1)  Clear zone (CZ) is that area immediately adjoining the end of a runway and which extends outward from the edge of the runway a distance of 3,000 feet and which is 3,000 feet in width (1,500 feet to either side of the centerline of the airport runway); 
(2)  Accident potential zone I (APZ I) is that area immediately adjoining the outer edge of the CZ and which extends outward from the boundary of the CZ a distance of 5,000 feet, and which is 3,000 feet in width; and 
(3)  Accident potential zone II (APZ II) is that area immediately adjoining the outer edge of the APZ I and which extends outward from the boundary of the APZ I a distance of 7,000 feet, and which is 3,000 feet in width. 
(b)  Noise zones: 
(1)  Noise zone A (DNL A) is that area within and bounded by DNL contour lines of between 65 decibels and 69 decibels of noise pressure. 
(2)  Noise zone B (DNL B) is that area within and bounded by DNL contour lines of between 70 decibels and 74 decibels of noise pressure. 
(3)  Noise zone C (DNL C) is that area within and bounded by DNL contour lines of between 75 decibels and 79 decibels of noise pressure. 
(4)  Noise zone D (DNL D) is that area within and bounded by DNL contour lines of 80 decibels and subject to noise pressure of 80 decibels and greater. 
22.4  Exemptions. The following uses and structures are exempt from compliance with the provisions of this section: 
(a)  Additions to existing one-family dwellings. Additions to existing one-family dwellings may be permitted when all other applicable zoning district bulk requirements are met. 
(b)  Additions to existing non-residential buildings. 
(1)  Additions to existing non-residential buildings designed for human occupation shall be limited to a maximum increase of 50% of the floor area. 
(2)  Additions to existing non-residential buildings designed for storage, warehousing and other uses not designed or intended for human occupancy as a primary use are unlimited in floor area. 
(c)  Temporary uses. Temporary uses which include but are not limited to public gatherings, celebrations and outdoor entertainment events are permitted, so long as the period of operation does not exceed five days. 
(d)  Temporary structures. Temporary buildings and structures such as tents, pavilions, bleachers, etc., that are not used for residential purposes, and which meet said applicable requirements as contained within this zoning ordinance appendix are permitted, so long as such uses and associated structures are constructed incidental to a permitted use. 
(e)  Accessory uses and structures. Accessory uses and structures incidental to a permitted principal structure or use. 
22.5  Land use and development standards. Any building or portion thereof constructed or placed within the AEOZ shall comply with the following standards: 
(a)  Unless specifically exempted under subsection 22.4 above, land uses shall be permitted or prohibited in accordance with subsection 22.6, land use compatibility table. 
(b)  Proposed structures situated within noise zones A through D shall be constructed with noise attenuation features to achieve the minimum interior noise level reductions specified by building type in subsection 22.6, land use compatibility table. 
(c)  In APZ I and APZ II, no structure may be erected over 60 feet in height, regardless of zoning district bulk regulations of the individual zoning district. 
(d)  All building permit applications for construction of new buildings or building additions not exempted under section 22.4, within AEOZ shall be accompanied by a written statement from a licensed architect or engineer, which lists all construction materials to be used and the resultant interior noise level reductions to be achieved. The written analysis provided by the engineer or architect shall demonstrate that the proposed construction will achieve compliance with the minimum required interior noise level reductions specified in subsection 22.6, land use compatibility table.

Section 24. - Planned neighborhood design option (PND). 
24.1  Generally. 
(a)  Planned neighborhoods. In order to encourage superior residential environments through a unified planning process, the planned neighborhood design option shall be permitted in R-20, R-15, R-1O, R-8, RM-1 and RM-2 zones as a conditional use subject to the provisions of article 10 of this ordinance and after a determination by the planning commission that the proposed planned neighborhood design presents a superior community design than would be possible under the conventional zone and is in accordance with the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan. The minimum size required for a planned residential development shall be 20 acres. 
(b)  Senior citizen housing option. In order to encourage the development of high quality housing opportunities designed to accommodate the particular needs of senior citizens, the senior citizen housing option shall be permitted in all zones as a conditional use, except in the M, IPM, IPM2, IPM3 and C-4 zones within which this option shall not be applicable. Preference shall be given to those projects which are within close proximity to public transit services and which are situated within one-quarter mile of a grocery store, pharmacy, restaurant, physician office, senior center or similar convenience service establishment. 
24.2  Review process. The planned neighborhood design option shall involve a three-step review and approval process. In the first step, the developer shall meet with the city council and present a general sketch plan and a statement documenting the project's compliance with the goals of the comprehensive plan for review. The general sketch plan shall reflect the general layout of streets, open space, and housing areas and types. Each application for a general sketch plan review shall be accompanied by a fee as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. The city council shall determine whether the proposed project is of such a design and type that it warrants further review by the planning commission. If the city council determines that further review is warranted, the second step shall be the conditional use review process which involves the submission of a conceptual plan which conforms in content to the design standards and requirements specified in subsections 24.5 and 24.6 of this section, as well as the plan submission requirements of subsection 24.8 of this section and article 10, section 1.6 of the zoning ordinance [this appendix]. Depending upon the type of development proposed, the following additional requirements shall apply: 
(a)  Proposals not involving land subdivision. Submission of plans for proposals which do not involve the subdivision of land shall also conform in content to the provisions of article 10, section 2.5 of the zoning ordinance [this appendix] pertaining to site development plans. Depending upon the complexity and physical size of a proposal, either a one- or two-step planning commission review process will be required. Plans for smaller, less complex projects may be processed as a unified conditional use and site development plan application which shall reflect conformity with the provisions of article 10, sections 1.6 and 2.5 of this ordinance. Large scale, more complex proposals may involve an initial conditional use/conceptual plan review by the planning commission in accordance with the provisions of article 10, section 1 of this ordinance, to be followed by a more detailed site development plan submission reflecting conformity with the provisions of article 10, section 2.5 of this ordinance. 
(b)  Proposals involving land subdivision. In the case of proposals involving subdivision of land, the conditional use plan shall also conform to the provisions of article V, section A of the land subdivision ordinance. 
If the conditional use/conceptual subdivision plan is approved, the plan would proceed to the third step which involves the submission of a site development plan and preliminary subdivision plan for review and approval by the planning commission in accordance with the provisions subsection 24.9 of this section. 
24.3  Permitted uses: 
(a)  Any use permitted in one-family residence zones; 
(b)  Any other residential use, including one-family lot line dwelling units, duplexes, multiplexes, townhouses, patio houses, garden apartments, and mid-rise apartments, but not including high-rise apartments, mobile homes, or manufactured homes; 
(c)  Accessory dwelling units may be proposed in conjunction with detached single-family houses if approved by the planning commission as an integral part of planned neighborhood design; 
(d)  Commercial uses accessory to the development as a whole in accordance with the standards of the C-1A zone; 
(e)  Under the senior citizen housing option, all housing types, and including congregate housing structures and uses, assisted living residences, and nursing homes. All such housing units and/or property shall be deed restricted to require that the head of household for each housing unit be at least 55 years of age or older. 
24.4  Maximum density. The maximum density for each zone shall be the same as follows, plus additional bonuses as set forth in section 24.7: 
24.41  R-20. The gross residential density in an R-20 planned residential development shall not exceed 1.6 dwelling units per acre. 
24.42  R-15. The gross residential density in an R-15 planned residential development shall not exceed two dwelling units per acre. 
24.43  R-10. The gross residential density in an R-10 planned residential development shall not exceed three dwelling units per acre. 
24.44  R-8. The gross residential density in an R-8 planned residential development shall not exceed 3.8 dwelling units per acre. 
24.45  RM-1. The gross residential density in an RM-1 planned residential development shall not exceed six dwelling units per acre. 
24.46  RM-2. The gross residential density in an RM-2 planned residential development shall not exceed eight dwelling units per acre. 
24.47  Senior housing option. Project density shall be generally compatible with the development pattern and existing or potential zone densities of the surrounding area. The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the planning commission that the project density proposed is compatible with the development pattern and density potential of the surrounding area in general, and with that of adjoining properties in particular. 
24.5  Design standards. The design standards and dimensional requirements (bulk and parking regulations) shall be in accordance with article 4, sections 4.10 and 4.11, except that the planning commission may relax any of these requirements where the developer can demonstrate that such action is desirable and consistent with the objectives of this ordinance and the comprehensive plan. 
24.51  Accessory dwelling units. Accessory dwelling units shall only be permitted if approved by the planning commission as part of the overall planned neighborhood design when it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the planning commission that such units would be beneficial to achieving a well balanced residential neighborhood. The following standards shall pertain to accessory dwelling units: 
(i)  Only one accessory dwelling unit shall be permitted in conjunction with a detached single-family house. 
(ii)  Accessory dwelling units shall only be permitted if dispersed occasionally within the neighborhood. It is not the intention of this [sub]section to permit such units in conjunction with the majority of single-family units proposed, but rather to permit such units on a limited basis in recognition of accessory units as valid contributors to the overall balance of housing options within a healthy and well designed residential neighborhood. 
(iii)  An accessory dwelling unit may be within the main dwelling house or within a freestanding structure such as a carriage house. 
(iv)  For purposes of calculating density, minimum lot area and a single-family unit with an accessory dwelling unit shall be counted as 1.5 dwelling units. Single-family houses with accessory dwelling units shall be physically separated from each other by at least three dwelling units of a different dwelling type which do not include accessory dwelling units. 
24.52  Senior citizen housing option.

Section 29. - Source water protection overlay zone (SWPOZ). 
29.1  Purpose. The purpose of this source water protection overlay zone is to provide a safe drinking water supply and to ensure that groundwater is adequately protected and maintained. The overlay zone's purpose is to protect public health and safety by minimizing contamination of the aquifer and to ensure that the aquifer is property maintained and supplied with clean water through the reduction of impervious surfaces. 
29.2  Definitions. 
    Aboveground storage tank (AST). An AST is a single containment vessel greater than 250 gallons as defined in the Delaware Regulations Governing Aboveground Storage Tanks. ASTs with a storage capacity greater than 12,499 gallons containing petroleum or hazardous substances, and ASTs with a storage capacity greater than 39,999 gallons containing diesel, heating fuel or kerosene are subject to the design, construction, operation and maintenance requirements of the Delaware AST regulations. 
    Hazardous material. A material which is defined in one or more of the following categories: 
Ignitable: A gas, liquid or solid which may cause fires through friction, absorption of moisture, or which has low flash points. Examples: white phosphorous and gasoline. 
Carcinogenic: A gas, liquid, or solid which is normally considered to be cancer causing or mutagenic. Examples: PCBs in some waste oils. 
Explosive: A reactive gas, liquid or solid which will vigorously and energetically react uncontrollably if exposed to heat, shock, pressure or combinations thereof. Examples: dynamite, organic peroxides and ammonium nitrate. 
Highly toxic: A gas, liquid, or solid so dangerous to man as to afford an unusual hazard to life. Example: chlorine gas. 
Moderately toxic: A gas, liquid or solid which through repeated exposure or in a single large dose can be hazardous to man. 
Corrosive: Any material, whether acid or alkaline, which will cause severe damage to human tissue, or in case of leakage might damage or destroy other containers of hazardous materials and cause the release of their contents. Examples: battery acid and phosphoric acid. 
    Underground storage tank (UST). A UST is one or a combination of tanks including underground pipes, the volume of which is ten percent or more belowground, as defined in the Delaware Regulations Governing Underground Storage Tank Systems. The following USTs are not subject to the design, construction, operation and maintenance requirements of the Delaware UST regulations: Residential heating fuel, agricultural and residential motor fuel USTs less than 1,100 gallons and any UST less than 110 gallons. 
29.3  Use and bulk requirements. The uses and bulk standards which govern the underlying zoning designations attached to the properties within the source water protection overlay zone shall apply in all instances except where uses are specifically prohibited by this section and except pertaining to impervious surface, ground cover, and floor area ratio. Where issues of impervious surface, ground cover, and floor area ratio are concerned, the provisions of the source water protection overlay zone are the governing provisions, overriding the existing zoning for the property. 
29.4  Zone boundaries. This section of the zoning ordinance encompasses the lands demarcated on the City of Dover Zoning Map as set forth in article 2 section 2 of this Ordinance, as the source water protection overlay zone. 
29.5  Uses prohibited. The following uses are specifically prohibited throughout the source water protection overlay zone: 
29.51  Uses prohibited: 
a)  Automobile body/repair shop, motor vehicle, boat or farm equipment service; 
b)  Gas stations and motor vehicle service stations; 
c)  Fleet/trucking/bus terminal;

n)  Injection wells/dry wells/sumps, except for single-family residences directing gutter downspouts to a drywell; 
o)  Underground storage tanks; 
p)  All uses not permitted in the underlying zone district. 
29.6  Geothermal wells. Geothermal wells are permitted uses within the source water protection overlay zone in accordance with other city and state regulations. 
29.7  Tier 3: excellent recharge areas. Lands defined as tier 3 lands are areas which have been identified as 'excellent recharge areas'. Recharge areas are defined as land with high percentages of sand and gravel that have "excellent" potential for recharge as determined through a stack unit mapping analysis performed originally by the Delaware Geological Survey. 
29.71  Applicability. The impervious cover restrictions of this section shall apply only to any activity requiring approval of the planning commission. 
29.72  Impervious surfaces. Impervious surfaces within tier 3 lands of the source water protection overlay zone are limited to a maximum of 30 percent. Limits upon impervious surface apply to portions of a site which is within tier 3 lands. New development may exceed the 30 percent impervious cover threshold up to 60 percent impervious cover provided the differential volume of stormwater generated from 30 percent to 60 percent impervious cover, based on the two-year storm, is infiltrated within an excellent recharge area. The use of infiltration shall be based upon the technical merits of the application as well as the ability to quantify the volume of recharge. All infiltration facilities shall be designed in accordance with the Delaware Sediment and Stormwater Regulations. 
29.73  Redevelopment. Site modification which requires site development plan approval must create a 15-percent reduction in the amount of impervious surface on the site when compared to pre-redevelopment conditions. 
(a)  If the 15-percent reduction would require a site to go below the 30-percent maximum impervious surface provision of section 29.72, then the maximum impervious surface cover for the site is 30 percent. 
(b)  If stormwater is infiltrated within the excellent recharge area as per section 29.72 then only an amount of reduction in impervious surface which is necessary to meet the 60-percent maximum will be required. 
29.74  Storage tanks. Underground storage tanks are prohibited within tier 3 lands. Aboveground storage tanks which use, store, transfer, or dispose of any solid or liquid material or waste having potentially harmful impact on groundwater quality are prohibited within tier 3 lands. 
29.75  Site design. All reasonable efforts must be undertaken to position permanent structures on the portions of the property which are not subject to the tier 3: excellent recharge area. The particular desires of personal or corporate entities shall not constitute reasonable efforts. 
29.76  Alternative design standards. It is the intent of this ordinance to protect, conserve, and improve the available supply of potable water while still maintaining property rights. As such, where the restrictions of this ordinance prevent development that would otherwise be reasonable and proper according to the base zoning, the applicant may request alternative design standards as part of their application and development plan. The planning commission may modify specific bulk standards when in the opinion of the commission, it has been demonstrated that the use of alternative design standards is desirable and consistent with the protection of water resources. Alternative bulk standards include, but are not limited to changes in building height/stories, floor area ratio, or building setbacks. 
29.77  Master plans. Site development which occurs as part of a site development master plan as specified in the zoning ordinance, article 10 section 2.58 may consider the area of the entire tier 3 portion of the master plan area when developing individual phases. This will allow for higher than prescribed amounts of impervious cover on specific portions of the master plan so long as the overall impervious surface for the entire tier 3 lands in the plan remains in compliance with this section. On a site development master plan, when the city engineer certifies that the project utilizes superior infiltration design that maximizes groundwater recharge, impervious cover may be increased to 75 percent. 
29.78  Improvements to existing residential lots. Improvements to existing residential lots, including additions to existing one-family dwellings, the placement of sheds, and fences are exempt from section 29.7 and may be permitted when all other applicable zoning district bulk requirements are met. 
29.79  Downtown target area. The downtown redevelopment target area as defined in appendix C, article II, section 3 [Target Area] of the City of Dover Code of Ordinances shall be exempt from the requirements and restrictions of the source water protection overlay zone. 
29.710  Special environmental considerations. On sites where infiltration would be contrary to a cleanup agreement or other conditions imposed by the department of natural resources and environmental control or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the impervious surface limitations of this section shall not apply to the affected areas. Such sites shall be certified by the City Engineer through the development application process. 
29.711  Procedure for Contesting the delineation of the source water protection overlay zone. Data used to define these zones was generated in a report from the Delaware Geological Survey entitled, "Report of Investigations No. 66, Ground-Water Recharge Potential Mapping in Kent and Sussex Counties, Delaware". Any challenges to the delineation of the source water protection overlay zone must follow the methods provided in the above sited report to contest the delineation. 
29.8  Tier 2: Primary wellhead protection areas. Lands defined as tier 2 lands are areas which have been identified as primary wellhead protection areas. 
29.81  Purpose and intent. The purpose of the primary wellhead protection areas is to safeguard the potable water resources of Dover and Kent County and to safeguard the public health, safety, and resources through regulation of land use and development within zones of protection surrounding potable water supply well fields. 
29.82  [Open space requirements.] Areas within 300 feet of the well shall be 100 percent open space. 
29.83  [Hazardous materials restrictions.] New development within 500 feet of the well must demonstrate that the new development will not produce, store, transfer or otherwise handle hazardous materials. 
29.84  [Wellhead production area reduction.] The primary wellhead protection area around the well may be reduced to a 150-foot radius provided a hydrogeological report, prepared by a Delaware registered geologist and submitted to the satisfaction of the Delaware Geological Survey and the DNREC, is prepared. The report must certify that (1) the minimum 60-day time of travel from a point to the public water supply well is maintained and (2) the well draws from a confined aquifer. Upon completion of such a report, the regulations governing tier 1 lands within the source water protection overlay zone will apply. 
29.85  Runoff. The natural runoff flowing into wellhead areas shall be allowed and all new stormwater runoff shall be diverted around the wellhead protection areas wherever practical. 
29.86  The stormwater system's discharge to tier 2. Primary wellhead protection areas land shall be by sheet flow through a grassland or discharge from a stormwater management facility having a wetland or aquatic bench. Stormwater runoff from all parking areas shall be directed to a stormwater management facility before it is discharged into a primary wellhead protection area. 
29.87  Boundary disputes.

ARTICLE 5. - SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS 

Section 1. - Supplementary regulations applying to residence zones. 
1.1  Accessory buildings. An accessory building may be located in any required side or rear yard provided: 
1.11 Such buildings shall not exceed 15 feet in height. 
1.12 Such buildings shall be set back five feet from any lot line and shall not be located less than ten feet from an adjoining principal structure. 
1.13 All such buildings in the aggregate shall not occupy more than 30 percent of the area of the required rear and side yard. 
Accessory buildings constructed at the same time may be located in pairs or groups in the required rear or side yard along the common side lot line or rear lot line of contiguous lots. 
1.2  Relation of accessory buildings to streets. No accessory building shall project nearer to the street on which the principal building fronts than such principal building. The board of adjustment may authorize the erection of garages under the following conditions: If the natural slope is from 12 percent to 20 percent within 25 feet of the street line, the board may permit a garage not closer than ten feet of the street line. If the slope is over 20 percent, a garage may be permitted not closer than five feet of the street line. 
1.3  Corner lots. 
1.31  Corner visibility. In all zones within the city, no structure, fence, wall, landscaping, earthen berm, sign or any other form of obstruction to visibility, in excess of three feet in height above the adjacent street grade, shall be erected, placed or maintained on any corner lot within the triangular area formed by intersecting right-of-way lines. Two sides of the triangular area shall be 20 feet in length and measured from the point of intersection of the right-of-way lines as further illustrated in figure 5-1. 

1.32  Yard requirements. Corner lots are considered to have two front yards. The rear yard for a corner lot shall be the yard that is opposite the street upon which the principal structure fronts. The side yard for a corner lot shall be the yard that is opposite the street adjacent to the side of the principal structure. 
1.33  Fences. A fence on a corner lot shall comply with the front yard requirement for height along the street upon which the principal structure fronts. A fence on a corner lot shall comply with the side yard requirement for height along the street adjacent to the side of the principal structure. 
1.4  Exceptions to lot depth requirements. The depth of any lot other than a corner lot may be decreased at any point to 75 percent of the minimum requirement if the average depth conforms with the minimum requirement. 
1.5  Exceptions to yard requirements. 
1.51  Permitted obstructions. Cornice or cantilevered roofs and chimneys may project not more than 21/2 feet into a required yard. Belt courses, windowsills and other ornamental features may project not more than six inches into a required yard. Paved terraces, steps, and walks (other than such as are needed for access to the buildings on the lot) shall not project within 15 feet of a street line or four feet of a property line. 
1.52  Entries and porticos. A roofed-over but unenclosed projection in the nature of an entry, portico or awning not more than eight feet wide and extending not more than six feet into the required front yard shall be exempt from the requirements of this section when the building otherwise complies with the regulations of this section. In computing the average setback, the presence of such entries and porticos shall be ignored. 
1.53  Existing setback. No proposed one-family or two-family dwelling need have a setback greater than the average setback of the two existing dwellings with the greatest setbacks within 200 feet on each side of the said proposed dwelling, on the same side of the street and within the same block and the same zone. 
1.54  Open decks. An open deck or patio extending to within ten feet of a rear lot line or within 20 feet of a rear lot for second story decks shall be exempt from rear yard setback requirements and lot coverage requirements so long as the principal structure complies with the regulations. Such open decks or patios shall not be enclosed and used as a part of the principal structure. 
1.55  Fences. Fences or walls shall be limited to a maximum height of four feet above the ground when situated within front yard areas, and shall be limited to a maximum height of six and one-half feet above ground when situated within side and rear yard areas. Fences situated on corner lots shall be subject to the provisions of article 5, section 1.3. For the purposes of this provision, on lots with dual street frontage that are not corner lots, a fence situated to the rear of the principal structure shall be limited to a maximum height of six and one-half feet above ground. Fences or walls with a height in excess of six and one-half feet above ground shall conform to the setback requirements for dwelling buildings as set forth in article 4 of this appendix. Fence material commonly referred to as "barbed wire" and/or "razor wire," or any similar material, shall be prohibited in residential zones. 
1.6  Existing small lots in all one-family residence zones. A lot owned individually and separately and separated from any adjoining tracts of land on November 27, 1971, which has a total area or width less than prescribed herein, may be used for a one-family residence, provided such lot shall be developed in conformity with all applicable zone regulations, other than the minimum lot area and lot width requirements, and with the minimum side yards set forth below:

1.7  Uniformity of design in all one-family residence zones. Except as provided in this ordinance, no building permit shall be issued for the erection of any building on land within any one-family residence zone, if it is like or substantially like any neighboring building existing or for which a building permit has been issued. To be deemed unlike any such building, a proposed building shall differ therefrom in the following respects: 
1.71 Relative location of windows in the front elevation or in each of both side elevations with respect to each other and with respect to any door, chimney, porch or attached garage in the same elevation; 
1.72 In the front elevation, both (a) relative location with respect to each other or garage, if attached, porch, if any, and the remainder of the building and (b) with the limits of the main roof, measured from the elevation of the first floor to the roof ridge, or, in case of a flat roof, the highest point of the roof beams, or (c) width of said portion of the building if it has a gable in the front elevation, otherwise the length of said roof ridge or said flat roof in the front elevation; and 
1.73 One of the following: 
a.  Height of the main roof edge, or, in the case of a building with a flat roof, the highest point of the roof beams above the elevation of the first floor; 
b.  Height of the main roof ridge above the top of the plat (all flat roofs shall be deemed identical in dimension); 
c.  Length of the main roof ridge, or, in the case of a building with a flat roof, length of the main roof; 
d.  Width between outside walls at the ends of the building measured under the main roof at right angles of the length thereof. 
    Buildings shall be deemed to be like each other in any dimension with respect to which the difference between them is not more than two feet. Buildings between which the only difference in relative location of elements is side-to-side reversal of elements shall be deemed to be alike in relative location of such elements. 
    Except as provided hereinafter, in relation to the premises with respect to which the permit is sought, a building shall be deemed to be a neighboring building if such building is located on any lot fronting on the same street as the proposed building which is the first, second, or third lot next along said street in either direction from the said proposed buildings or which is any lot directly across the street from the proposed building lot or from any lot referred to hereinafter. 
    The planning commission may vary or waive in their entirety any or all requirements of this section wherever, in their opinion, the overall layout of the neighborhood, road pattern, setback variations, grading, observation of natural features, views and exposure and siting of individual structures is such as to prevent monotony of architectural design despite the similarity of the structures themselves. 
1.8  Arterial street buffers. Where residential zoned property fronts on a principal arterial street, as designated by the comprehensive plan, a landscape buffer shall be required in addition to normal landscaping of the street right-of-way. This landscape buffer shall be required when the property is subject to site development plan review or site development master plan review by the planning commission according to appendix B, zoning, article 10, planning commission. Arterial street buffers shall be a minimum of 30 feet in depth, measured from the right-of-way line of the arterial street. 
1.81  Landscaping of arterial street buffers. At the time of development of the property, the arterial street buffer shall be planted with a variety of trees, shrubs and ground cover. The landscape design and planting plan for these arterial street buffers shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission as an integral part of the site development plan. 
1.82  Standards for arterial street buffer landscaping. Landscaping in arterial street buffers shall follow the landscape guidelines outlined in appendix B, zoning, article 5, supplementary regulations, section 15, landscape guidelines of this appendix. Landscaping shall be designed to enhance the appearance of the arterial street, complement the architecture of buildings on site, and integrate with adjacent landscape areas. Landscape designs and planting plans which would pose a hazard to traffic on the arterial street, obstruct underground or overhead utilities or infrastructure, or significantly impede visibility of properties from the street shall be prohibited. 
1.83  Planning commission waiver. The planning commission may approve a buffer less than 30 feet in depth. In approving a lesser amount of buffering, the planning commission shall consider the following factors: 
a)  Whether there are specific constraints related to existing lot size, lot configuration or the orientation of existing buildings on adjoining properties that would severely limit the development potential of the property if a deep buffer was required. 
b)  Whether a deep or shallow buffer would cause the property to be out of character with the surrounding built environment. 
c)  Whether there is significant landscape area within the right-of-way of the arterial street itself that can contribute to the buffer, and whether future road improvement activities are likely to reduce the depth of this area. 
d)  Whether the landscape design and planting plan for the buffer achieve the standards of subsection 1.82-Standards for arterial street buffer landscaping. 
1.9  Storage of furniture and appliances outdoors. The storage of any equipment, materials, furnishings or appliances that are not designed or manufactured for exterior placement is prohibited. Items such as lawn furniture, barbeque grills, garden tools, and children's outdoor play equipment may be stored outside in an orderly fashion. 
1.10  Portable storage units. For the purpose of this section the following definitions shall apply: 
a.  Portable storage unit means any container designed for the storage of personal property which is typically rented to owners or occupants of property for their temporary use and which is delivered and removed by truck. 
1.101  Number, duration, and removal. There shall be no more than one portable storage unit per lot. No portable storage unit shall remain on a lot in a residential district in excess of 30 consecutive days, unless the lot is the subject of an active building permit, in which case it may remain as long as the building permit is active. 
1.102  Cumulative time restriction. No portable storage unit as defined in section 1.10 of this article shall be placed at any one site in a residential district in excess of 60 days in any calendar year, unless the lot is the subject of an active building permit. 
1.103  Location. The location of the portable storage unit shall not affect the health, safety and/or welfare of the neighborhood including, but not limited to, blocking access to a fire hydrant and obstructing the view of street intersections. 
1.11  Swimming pools. 
1.111  Definition. For the purposes of this section, swimming pools shall be defined as any pool, tank, depression, or excavation in or above ground, or other structure which shall cause retaining of water over a greater depth than 24 inches. 
1.112  Safety . All swimming pools as defined in this section must conform to the requirements of Dover Code, Chapter 22-Buildings and Building Regulations. 
1.113  Placement . Swimming pools shall be permitted to be established in the side and rear yard, but shall be prohibited from placement between the principal structure and the street. 
1.114  Setback . The edge of the swimming pool, specifically referring to the edge of the water containment portion of the pool, shall be no less than 15 feet away from all property lines. All associated structures, buildings, and pavement related to the swimming pool shall be no less than five feet away from all property lines. 
1.12  Infill standards. In locations where a lot or group of lots lies within a developed area, the following standards shall apply to the development of the infill lots: 
(a)  Sidewalks. Standard City of Dover sidewalk, per chapter 98, shall be required to be installed along public street frontage of every infill property by the property owner or developer. 
(b)  Landscaping. Infill structures shall be designed to minimize the impact on existing, mature trees when practical. All residential lots shall include landscaping to include plants and shrubs along the portions of the house that front a public street. No form of vegetation shall be planted on a property in a way that blocks more than half of the front façade(s) from public view. 
(c)  Primary facade. All buildings shall include a primary entry along the property's street frontage, and shall also include a porch or other entry feature.

Section 2. - Supplementary regulations applying to general residence (RG-1, RG-2, RG-0, RG-3 and RG-4) zones. 
2.1  Exceptions to yard requirements. Garages so designed as to allow the use of the roof thereof as part of the grounds may be erected in side or rear yards not nearer than four feet to any property line, provided the average height of such wall or walls thereof which face a side lot line is not in excess of 61/2 feet above the average level of such lot line. 
    The side yard provisions may be eliminated, but not reduced, along any portion of a lot line where a building erected on an adjoining lot is built to the lot line, provided that the second side yard shall be increased to a minimum width of two times the width otherwise required. 
2.2  Exceptions to maximum coverage regulations. Garages designed so that the roof is usable open space shall be exempt from any coverage limitation. The planning commission, in reviewing a site development plan, may issue a special permit for accessory garages covering ten percent more of the lot than would otherwise be permitted if they find that it is impractical to fulfill off-street parking requirements under the principal building and/or within a garage whose roof is usable open space. 
2.3  Length of buildings. No building shall exceed a length of 220 feet. 
2.4  Distance between buildings. The following minimum distances between buildings shall be observed:

2.43 Notwithstanding any other provisions, and except as provided hereinafter, no building on any lot shall intrude into the area enclosed by an arc of a circle with a radius of 60 feet extending 70 degrees on each side of a line perpendicular to the center of any legally required window (other than a bathroom or kitchen window), and the exterior radii of such arc. All measurements shall be performed in horizontal projection at the sill level of the subject window. This limitation shall not apply to any wall of the same building the plane of which intersects the plane of the wall in which the subject window is located at an exterior angle of more than 80 degrees. A minimum distance of 60 feet shall be maintained between the subject window and any wall parallel thereto, whether such wall is a part of the same or of another building on the same lot. 
  

Illustration of 2.43 
2.5  Courts. 
2.51  Inner courts. An inner court is permitted if the minimum dimension of such court is not less than 11/2 times the average height of all surrounding walls, but not less than 60 feet. The height of walls surrounding an inner court shall be measured from finished grade at the base thereof to the top of such wall, except that, in the case of roofs with a slope exceeding five inches vertical to 12 inches horizontal, the height shall be measured to the mean point between the top of the said wall and the highest point of the roof. 
2.52  Outer courts. The minimum width of an outer court shall be 20 feet and the depth thereof not exceed its width. 
Section 3. - Supplementary regulations applying to nonresidential buildings, except in IPM zone. 
3.1  Supplementary height regulations in nonresidential zones. In nonresidential zones, except for one- or two-family dwellings, where a lot has frontage on two or more streets or other public ways, the height limitation shall apply only as measured from the curb level along the street or way with a higher elevation above sea level. When penthouses, etc., are over 12 feet high and cover more than 20 percent of the roof area, measurements must be taken to the top of such penthouses or bulkheads; provided, however, that no ornamental or decorative part of a building which is not used as a living or storage area, such as steeples, spires and the like be greater in height than the maximum height of the building to which the same is attached. All penthouses, bulkheads, etc., must be ten feet back of the sidewalls, except that walls of elevators and stair enclosures may be built on the sidewall when required by the plan of the building. 
3.2  Courts for nonresidential buildings. 
3.21  Inner courts. No inner court shall have a minimum dimension less than one-half of the average height of all surrounding walls. 
3.22  Outer courts. The minimum width of an outer court shall be 20 feet and the depth thereof shall not exceed its width. 
Section 4. - Supplementary sign regulations. 
4.1  Purpose statement. The purpose of this section is to create a legal framework for a comprehensive and balanced system of signs and other street graphics to facilitate an easy and pleasant communication between people and their environment. The ordinance from which this section is derived is enacted to avoid the visual clutter that is potentially harmful to vehicular and pedestrian safety, property values, business environment and opportunities, and community appearance. With these purposes in mind, it is the intent of this section to authorize the use of signs which are compatible with their surroundings, appropriate to the activity that displays them, expressive of the identity of individual activities and the community as a whole, and legible in the circumstances in which they are seen, understanding that it is important for the economic vitality of the community as well as individual businesses and institutions that they are clearly identified and their services are understood by the traveling public. 
    All signs, which are regulated by this section, shall conform to the following general guidelines: 
A.  The legibility of signs. Signs shall be legible under the circumstances in which they are primarily seen. Signs shall legibly convey their messages without being distracting or unsafe to motorists reading them. The legibility of signs is related to the speeds at which they are viewed; the context and surroundings in which they are seen; and the design, colors, and contrasts of the sign copy and sign face. 
B.  The relationship of signs to the buildings and sites they identify. Signs shall be an integral architectural element of the buildings and sites that they identify and their design shall be consistent with, and not detract from, the overall architectural concept of the site. Signs should be of an appropriate size and scale in relation to the buildings on the lot. 
4.2  General provisions. 
A.  Permitting. No sign, advertising display or structure, poster or device shall be erected, moved, enlarged or reconstructed except in accordance with this section. All signs, except exempt signs, shall require a permit and fee as prescribed in Appendix F, Chapter 22-Buildings and Building Regulations. 
B.  Administration. Administration, interpretation, and enforcement of the provisions of this section shall be under the authority of the city planner or their authorized designee. In administering the provisions of this section, the city planner shall evaluate signs and applications for sign permits for conformity with the design guidelines, standards, and specifications contained herein. Appeals from the application or interpretation of any provision of this section may be processed in accordance with the provisions of article 9 (board of adjustment) of the zoning ordinance. 
C.  Unsafe, dilapidated and illegal signs. If it is determined by the city planner or his authorized designee that any sign is unsafe, presents a hazard to the safe operation and movement of motorized or nonmotorized vehicular traffic, or to pedestrians, or is in a dilapidated condition, or is in a state of disrepair, or is otherwise in violation of any provision of this section, the owner of such sign shall be responsible for removal of such sign and supporting structure within 14 days of receipt of written notification by the city planner. In cases where signs are determined to be unsafe or present a hazard, the city planner may order their removal in a shorter period of time. Responsibility for removal shall be in accordance with subsection 4.10-Nonconforming signs, B., and subsection 4.11-Abandoned and Damaged signs, of this section. 
D.  Setback. All signs, including those which do not require a permit, shall be setback from the right-of-way in accordance with the provisions of Article 5, Section 4.7, unless otherwise specified, and shall not interfere with aboveground or underground utilities. 
E.  Administrative waiver. For existing developed properties where placement of the sign in accordance with the required setback would interfere with existing required parking, fire lane, or other site improvements, the city planner shall have the authority to waive the setback requirement.

4.8  Unified Comprehensive Signage Plan. 
A.  Purpose statement. Recognizing that large campuses and complexes have signage needs that may not be adequately addressed by traditional sign regulations, this subsection of the ordinance is intended to allow a procedure for approval of a unified comprehensive signage plan for these Unified Campuses and Complexes. 
1.  Campuses and complexes are required to follow all standard signage requirements, as embodied elsewhere in this section, unless they choose to apply to the planning commission for comprehensive signage plan approval. All such plans must embody a thorough review of all existing signs. 
2.  Any proposed shopping center or group of three or more principal structures under common management and operation located on one or more contiguous properties is required to submit an application for comprehensive signage plan approval to the planning commission. 
3.  Any business or institution which has more than 400 linear feet of frontage on a principal arterial may submit an application for comprehensive signage plan approval. 
B.  Design guidelines for unified comprehensive signage plans. 
1.  Unified campuses and complexes applying for a unified comprehensive signage plan may not be held to the height, size, number and area regulations for signs found in other subsections of this section. However, the number, type and size of signs proposed may not be excessive, and must be in proportion to the scale of the buildings and the uses on the site. 
2.  All unified comprehensive signage plans must comply with all design guidelines found in subsection 4.4-Design requirements of this section, as well as all specific design guidelines found in this section. 
3.  Building signs shall be in harmony with the overall architectural concept for the site, and be compatible with each other and the building facades. 
4.  The freestanding signs identifying shopping centers and other unified campuses and complexes shall identify the name of the campus or complex and no more than three separate tenants within the campus or complex unless otherwise approved by the planning commission. 
5.  There shall be architectural harmony and unity of signs within a unified campus or complex. Sign type, color scheme, size, and illumination within the site shall be coordinated and shall be compatible with the architecture of the center and the surrounding area. 
C.  Planning commission duties. In reviewing and approving comprehensive signage plans, the planning commission shall take into consideration the public health, safety and welfare, the comfort and convenience of the public in general and of the residents, businesses, and property owners of the immediate neighborhood in particular, and shall ensure that unified campuses and complexes have adequate, but not excessive, signage. Specifically, the following objectives shall guide the commission when reviewing such plans: 
1.  That the size and complexity of the campus or complex warrants the need for extra signage under the provisions of this section; 
2.  That, in respect to the number and type of entrances, the placement of signage at or near those entrances provides superior visibility in order to ensure the safety of the driving public; 
3.  That the proposed signs are adequate in number to safely direct the public to the use or uses on the site; 
4.  The proposed signs must not have an adverse impact on the visibility of adjacent signs, and shall be consistent with, or an improvement over, the prevailing type and style of signage in the general area; 
5.  That the proposed signs will be of a style and color which will complement the architecture of the site, and the area in general. 
D.  Submission requirements. 
1.  A pre-application meeting is required. No application will be accepted without a pre-application meeting. 
2.  Copies of a sign plan, which details the signage proposal, including relevant application forms, will be due on the regularly scheduled submission deadline for planning commission review. The sign plan shall illustrate the physical location of all existing and proposed signs on the subject property and their relationship to existing and/or proposed buildings on the site. The submission plan shall include color renderings of each proposed sign (drawn to scale), along with architectural elevation drawings of the building depicting the placement of all wall mounted signs existing and proposed. 
3.  Public notice is required, following the procedures set forth in article 10, section 2.43(C). 
4.  The application fee as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines, is due at time of application. 
E.  Amendments to approved comprehensive signage plans. Any new or revised signs to be placed on a property with an approved comprehensive signage plan need not go back to the planning commission for re-approval if the sign area is not increased more than 15 percent, and the proposed signs conform to the overall design concept and colors as approved. The 15 percent increase shall be calculated cumulatively over the life of the project, based upon the originally approved sign area. 
4.9  Supplementary sign provisions. 
A.  Window signs. 
1.  Three window signs shall be permitted as additional signage on walls fronting on the public right-of-way. 
2.  Window signs shall not cover more than 50 percent of any window exclusive of window and/or door frame. 
3.  Windows principally viewed from drive aisles and parking lots and not prominently visible from the public right-of-way shall be exempt from restrictions on the number of signs, and may be approved by the city planner for a window coverage area greater than 50 percent when the business elects to have less window signage than permitted on the windows fronting on, or prominently visible from, the public right-of-way. 
4.  Window signs shall be permitted on windows on the first floor of a building only. 
5.  The city planner may waive the provisions of this subsection when it has been demonstrated that the proposed window signs are of a unique or superior quality and style, and are intended to compliment the architectural design of the building, or when the business elects to use less wall signs than permitted for the purpose of complimenting the architectural design of the building. Signs granted this waiver are not exempt from the requirement to obtain a sign permit. 
B.  Historic district signs. 
1.  All signs in the historic district must meet the standards laid out in the Design Standards and Guidelines for the City of Dover Historic District Zone. Any and all standards found elsewhere in this section may be waived as part of the architectural review approval when proposed signs are determined to contribute to or improve the historic context of the building. 
C.  Gas station signage. 
1.  Canopy signs. 
(a)  Canopy sign height shall not exceed 30 feet. 
(b)  Canopy sign copy shall be directed toward a public street. 
(c)  Canopy sign area shall be limited to no greater than 20 percent of the area of the canopy face to which the sign is applied. 
2.  Exempt signs. 
(a)  State or federal required price per gallon signage shall not count towards overall sign area for the site, unless they exceed 32 square feet in size. 
(b)  Price per gallon signs not exceeding two square feet, located on the pump itself. 
D.  Temporary signs. 
1.  Temporary signs. Temporary signs for special events including inflatable signs with a surface area of less than 100 square feet and not more than 25 feet tall, may be erected on the premises of any establishment conducting a special event, provided that such signs do not exceed a total of two signs with a total of 100 square feet in sign area.. Temporary signage shall be displayed no longer than 90 days per calendar year. For grand openings, the maximum number, sign type, and allowable area may be waived by the city planner. Permits for such signs are required and shall be accompanied by a fee as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. The city planner may waive the time period, not to exceed an additional 30 days, if they determine that there are extenuating circumstances requiring further time for a temporary sign. 
2.  Race weekend signs. During any seven-day period prior to the Saturday or Sunday that auto racing is occurring, temporary signs may be erected without a permit and with no restrictions on the number or size of the signs. 
3.  Inflatable signs. Permits for such signs are required and shall be accompanied by a fee as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. 
(a)  Inflatable signs with a surface area equal to or less than 100 square feet and not more than 25 feet tall are permitted in subsection 4.9-Supplementary Sign provisions, D.1., of this section and shall meet the following requirements: 
i.  The inflatable sign shall be setback from the edge of the right-of-way a minimum of 25 feet. 
ii.  The inflatable sign shall be securely anchored to the building or ground. 
(b)  Inflatable signs with a surface area over 100 square feet and not more than 25 feet tall are permitted only during grand opening events, community festivals, and during race weekends in accordance with subsection 4.9 Supplementary Sign provisions, D.1. and D.2., of this section and shall meet the following requirements: 
i.  The inflatable sign shall be setback from the edge of the right-of-way a minimum of 25 feet. 
ii.  A plot plan/survey is required showing the placement of the inflatable sign in respect to utility lines and traffic. 
iii.  The inflatable sign shall be securely anchored to the building or ground. 
E.  Motor vehicle sales lots. This subsection allows motor vehicle sales lots to compensate for their likelihood to be mistaken for ordinary parking lots unless additional signs or other attention getting devices are placed in the sales area. It has also been demonstrated that these businesses tend to have smaller buildings relative to their land area diminishing their ability to effectively use wall signs. 
1.  Banners are permitted on motor vehicle sales lots with a permit. Such banners may be permitted at a rate not to exceed one banner for each ten motor vehicle parking/storage spaces on the premises, and any such banner shall not be situated closer than 50 feet of any other banner on the premises. Parking spaces required for employees, customers, and service department uses shall not be counted to calculate the number of banners. The term "banner" does not include pennants, streamers, balloons, or other temporary or permanent signs. 
2.  Banners shall not exceed a width of three feet. 
3.  All banners must be securely attached to light standards, poles, or other substantial mounting hardware. Except for temporary signs permitted under the provisions of subsection 4.9-Supplementary sign provisions, D., of this section, all banners must be constructed of a permanent, weather resistant material. 
F.  Shared freestanding signs. 
1.  For adjoining nonresidential properties, a freestanding sign structure may be shared among adjoining property owners or businesses solely for the purpose of identification of the adjoining premises or businesses. 
2.  Where multiple property owners have agreed to share a freestanding sign as referenced in subsection 4.4-Design requirements, of this section, the shared freestanding sign shall be entitled to a combined sign area bonus of not more than 50 percent over the freestanding sign area otherwise permitted for the property on which the shared freestanding sign would be placed. 
3.  The permit application for a shared freestanding sign shall be accompanied by a binding legal agreement between the multiple adjoining property owners and/or businesses which describes the ownership and maintenance obligations for such shared sign. 
G.  Single buildings with multiple commercial tenant spaces or facades. 
1.  Structures, such as shopping centers, which contain multiple commercial tenant spaces, are permitted to have at least one wall sign on each unit. This provision shall only apply to units on the first floor of the structure. 
2.  When a structure is designed so that there are distinctly different facades or sections of the building along a single frontage, at least one wall sign is permitted on each facade or section of the building. 
3.  Multi story office buildings with multiple tenants are permitted one wall sign per tenant. Signs shall not be located above the second story. 
H.  Vehicle and utility trailer signs . Vehicles or utility trailers shall be permitted to have vehicle signs attached to or painted on them, with no sign permit required. However, the city planner may require any vehicle or utility trailer with a vehicle sign to be moved if he/she determines that the vehicle is inoperable or being used for the sole purpose of displaying signage. Vehicles and utility trailers shall be moved to a location not visible from the public right-of-way, or, if no such location is available, as far away from the public right-of-way as possible. In making the determination, the city planner shall use the following criteria; at least two criteria shall be met before this section requires moving a vehicle: 
1.  The sign is temporarily attached to the vehicle or utility trailer, rather than painted on or applied in a permanent manner. 
2.  The sign includes directional copy or symbols that only function correctly when the vehicle or utility trailer is parked in one or more specific locations. 
3.  The vehicle or utility trailer does not move during the normal business hours of operation of the business. 
4.  The vehicle or utility trailer is regularly parked in a location or manner to be prominently displayed to the public, even though a more discrete parking area is available at the business location. 
5.  The vehicle or utility trailer is inoperable, meaning it is not properly and currently registered and tagged; is damaged or disabled as to not immediately be movable; is raised off the ground; is missing required equipment enabling it to travel on a public roadway; is parked in a location where it cannot access a public roadway; or cannot be started and moved off its location. 
4.10  Nonconforming signs. 
A.  Exclusions. Nonconforming signs which are within ten percent of compliance of any height, area or location requirement and which conform to all other provisions of this ordinance [section] shall be considered legal signs for the purposes of these regulations, except as provided in subsection 4.10-Nonconforming signs, B.4, below. 
B.  Removal or compliance required. Nonconforming signs shall be removed from the premises or otherwise made to comply with these regulations in the following instances: 
1.  When there is renovation to more than 75 percent of the exterior of the principal building measured in square feet of exterior wall surface area, or expansion of more than 20 percent of the floor area of the principal building measured in square feet of floor area on the premises on which such nonconforming signs are present, except that freestanding signs that are nonconforming as specified shall not be required to conform; however, the degree of non-conformity shall not increase. When, within any given two-year period, individual renovation projects involving less than 75 percent of the building exterior and/or individual building additions involving less than 20 percent of the floor area of the principal building on the premises would in aggregate exceed the 75 percent renovation and/or 20 percent expansion thresholds set forth herein, all such nonconforming signs shall be brought into conformity with these regulations or shall be removed from the premises. 
2.  Prior to the issuance of any permit for the placement of any additional signage on the property. No new signs of any type shall be added to the property until the nonconforming sign is removed. 
3.  Nonconforming signs (including all supporting structures and mounting hardware) which have been abandoned shall be removed from the premises or otherwise made to conform within one year from the date of abandonment. Refacing the sign in accordance with other requirements of this section does not absolve an owner from complying with this subsection. In certain instances where it is evident that the reoccupation or reuse of a premises which contains an abandoned nonconforming sign is imminent, the city planner may grant an extension of time within which to reestablish the use of such nonconforming sign. 
4.  Any nonconforming sign which has been removed from the premises shall be considered discarded, and replacement shall constitute a new sign, and require new permits. 
C.  Notification and responsibility. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of record of such property to cause the removal of such nonconforming signs in accordance with these provisions. When any of the above-listed conditions exist, the city planner is authorized to issue written notice to the owner of record of such property, stating that such signs shall be removed within two calendar weeks of the date of receipt of the written notice. In cases where signs are determined to be unsafe or present a hazard, the city planner may order their removal in a shorter period of time. Failure to comply with these regulations, after due notice, shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance [section] and is punishable in accordance with the provisions of article 8, section 4 of this ordinance [section]. In addition, in the event that compliance is not achieved within the stated period, the city planner may remove or cause to be removed from the premises any such signs in violation of this section. All expenses incidental to such removal shall be charged to the owner of record of such property and shall constitute a lien upon such property. 
4.11  Abandoned and damaged signs. 
A.  Abandoned. All signs that conform to the current regulations which are deemed abandoned shall either be refaced with a blank or blacked out face or removed totally (including the supporting structure and/or mounting hardware) within 90 days of abandonment. Covering sign copy with tarps, paper, tape, cardboard or other nonpermanent materials is not an acceptable method of refacing. 
B.  Removal. Any conforming sign, which has been removed from the premises, shall be considered discarded, and replacement shall constitute a new sign, and require new permits. 
C.  Repair. All signs that are damaged (no longer working, cracked, missing pieces, etc.) shall be repaired within 30 days. A permit is not required as long as the sign will look exactly the same as it did before the sign was damaged. If there are any changes (color, script, etc.) to the sign a new permit will be required. 
4.12  Historic or significant signs. 
A.  Preservation of historic or significant signs. Signs that are at least 50 years old and considered historic or to have cultural/aesthetic significance shall be protected and preserved. If these signs are legally nonconforming they shall maintain their nonconforming status indefinitely. The determination of the historic or cultural/aesthetic significance of the sign shall be determined by the historic district commission. 
1.  The owner of the premises on which these signs reside shall maintain the signs to ensure they work and are in good condition.

Section 5. - Supplementary regulations applying to group housing zone (RG-3). 
[(a)]  Number of dwelling units per group. The maximum number of dwelling units per group shall be eight. 
[(b)]  Distance between building groups. No part of any building group shall be nearer than 30 feet to any other building group and no portion of the front or rear of any building group shall be nearer than 50 feet to any part of another building group. When the planning commission has reduced the side yard requirements through a waiver to eight feet in accordance with the supplementary minimum side yard requirement paragraph [in subsection (c)] of this section, then no part of any building group of four or less units shall be nearer than 16 feet to any other building group of four or less units and no portion of the front or rear of any building group of four or less units shall be nearer than 50 feet to any part of another building group of four or less units. 
[(c)]  Supplementary minimum side yard requirements. The minimum side yard of 15 feet for group dwellings of four or less units may be waived to eight feet by the planning commission to allow for the separation of group dwelling buildings into two or more group buildings, provided that the total number of units permitted by the reduction of the minimum side yard requirement does not exceed the number of group dwelling units otherwise allowed within the same space by meeting the 15-foot side yard requirement. Such waiver shall only be granted by the planning commission after a determination that the reduction in side yard width affords a superior design and does not diminish safety. 
[(d)]  Exception to front yard requirement. In developments where single-family dwellings are proposed adjacent to group dwellings (i.e., duplexes or townhouses), the minimum front yard requirement may be waived by the planning commission to 15 feet, conditioned that driveways are provided with a minimum 20-foot long driveway. Such waiver shall only be granted by the planning commission after a determination that the reduction in front yard width affords a superior design and does not diminish safety. 
[(e)]  Minimum lot areas for single-family homes. The minimum lot area of the single-family detached dwelling may be waived by the planning commission to 6,000-foot developments where single-family dwellings are intermixed with group dwellings (i.e., duplexes or townhouses). Such waiver shall only be granted by the planning commission after a determination that the reduction in lot area affords a superior design and does not diminish safety. 
(Ord. of 1-10-1996) 
Section 6. - Dumpsters for trash and recycling. 
6.1  Location of trash receptacles. In all zones of the City of Dover (except in residential zones where standard City of Dover 90-gallon trash containers are used), all trash receptacles and bulk recycling bins (excluding publicly operated recycling drop off centers), which shall be referred to collectively as "dumpsters" in this ordinance, are to be situated in order to allow safe and efficient access by trash collection vehicles, and shall be screened from public view. All dumpsters must comply with the following regulations: 
6.11  Location and screening required. All dumpsters must be located in approved locations on the lot. Dumpsters must be placed on hard, paved, dust-free surfaces and may not be placed in designated parking spaces, fire lanes, or access ways. Outside storage of trash, cardboard, or shipping pallets is prohibited. A dumpster enclosure is required to screen the dumpster from view whenever these units are situated so that they will be visible from any public right-of-way or from an adjacent property. 
6.12  Minimum dumpsters required. 
Use Dumpsters Required Restaurant Two required for the first 3,000 square feet of gross building area; one required for each additional 3,000 square feet of gross building area or fraction thereof Shopping center (excluding supermarkets or anchor tenants) Two required for the first three stores; one required for each store thereafter Supermarkets & anchor tenants in shopping centers Two required in addition to requirements for shopping center Office & retail less than 50,000 square feet Two required for the first 16,000 square feet of gross floor area; one required for each additional 16,000 square feet of gross floor area or fraction thereof Office & retail greater than 50,000 square feet Two required for the first 50,000 square feet of gross floor area; one required for each additional 24,000 square feet of gross floor area or fraction thereof Industrial, warehousing & institutional Two required for the first 80,000 square feet of gross building area; one required for each additional 40,000 square feet of gross building area or fraction thereof Apartment complex Two required for the first 48 apartments; one required for each additional 24 apartments or fraction thereof  
6.13  Selection of trash service. Applicants for site development plan approval shall specify the proposed method of trash collection (side load or front load) at the time of application. A change in the method of collection may require an alteration of the site plan, subject to approval of the city planner or the planning commission. 
6.14  Maneuvering space. Adequate off-street truck maneuvering space shall be provided on-lot and not within any public street right-of-way or other public lands. Internal site circulation lanes are to be designed with adequate turning radii to accommodate the size and efficient maneuvering of trash collection vehicles. 
6.15  Minimum dimensions for dumpster enclosures. All dumpster enclosures must be adequate to screen dumpsters from public view. Enclosures for private collection must be no less than seven feet in height. The height of enclosures for City of Dover collection may be no less than five feet high. 
6.16  Enclosure construction. All dumpster enclosures shall be constructed of durable materials that will withstand the normal use and wear expected in trash removal operations. Whenever a dumpster, in its enclosure, will be visible from a public right-of-way, the appearance of the dumpster enclosures shall complement the architecture of the principal building on the lot, and be constructed with the same or similar exterior materials. 
6.17  Gates. Gates are required whenever a dumpster, in its enclosure, will be visible from a public right-of-way. Gates must be designed to swing back behind the front of the enclosure and lock in the open position. If City of Dover trash service is provided, it is the responsibility of the property owner or occupant to open and securely lock back the gates to allow for trash pick up. The gates may be opened 12 hours prior to pick up, and must be closed within 12 hours after pick up. 
6.18  Reduction of dumpster requirement . When a use is required to provide dumpsters as part of site development plan approval, the required number of dumpsters may be reduced under the following circumstances: 
a)  Dumpster pads reserved for future use. An area of the site reserved for a dumpster may be substituted for an actual dumpster. The provided area must be large enough to accommodate a dumpster and must be accessible to trash collection services. The city planner may require that the owner of record of the property provide a dumpster in the reserved location, together with any enclosure required, upon determining there is need for the additional dumpster. 
b)  Trash compactor substitution. Trash compactors may be substituted for ordinary dumpsters at a two to one ratio. The city planner may approve a higher substitution ratio if specifications are provided indicating the machine will achieve a correspondingly higher trash compaction ratio. Trash compactors must meet the same location and screening requirements as other dumpsters. Sites providing trash compactors must still provide separate receptacles for recycling. 
6.2  Location and screening approval required . The locations of new dumpsters on a site and any screening necessary shall be approved through the site development plan approval process, according to the type of review required in article 10 of this appendix. 
6.3  Unauthorized dumpsters . Any dumpster not previously approved through the site development plan approval process may be required by the city planner to be moved, removed, or screened if said dumpster is a nuisance to neighboring properties by virtue of its current location. 
(Ord. of 9-13-1999; Ord. No. 2017-12 , 10-9-2017) 
Section 7. - Supplementary regulations applying to all non-residential zones. 
7.1  Lighting. Lighting of commercial uses shall provide no less than 11/2 footcandles at grade. Light shall be deflected away from adjacent residential areas and shall not be distracting to traffic on adjacent roads. 
7.2  Opaque barrier. Visual and sound screening shall be provided on a non-residential use when abutting a residential use, except in front yard areas. The screening shall be required to be installed on site as part of planning commission or administrative site plan approval. Where required, screening shall consist of an opaque barrier at least six feet in height, accompanied by landscaping. 
7.21  Opaque barrier options. The requirement for the opaque barrier may be met by choosing one of the following: 
a)  An opaque fence made of durable materials such as wood, vinyl, composite, etc. 
b)  A wall constructed of masonry materials, either stucco, brick, split-faced block, or decorative concrete. If the principal structure on the lot is of masonry construction, the wall shall match the exterior of the building. 
c)  An earthen berm (3:1 slope maximum). 
d)  An earthen berm (3:1 slope maximum) with either an opaque fence or wall constructed on top. Materials of the fence or wall shall be as specified in options a) and b). The total height of the barrier may be no less than six feet high. 
7.22  Landscaping options. The required opaque barrier must be accompanied by one of the following: 
a)  A durable and continuous evergreen planted screen, six feet in height at the time of planting. In the case of an earthen berm, the evergreen screen may be on the top of the berm. 
b)  A hedge that will grow to a height of at least six feet at maturity. The hedge shall be interspersed with evergreen trees at least six feet high at the time of planting. The hedge shall be at least four feet high at the time of planting. 
7.23  Parking lots. Whenever a parking lot is located across the street from a residential use, it shall be screened from view of such land by a thick hedge located along a line drawn parallel to the street, such hedge to be interrupted only at points of ingress and egress and to meet the corner visibility standards of appendix B, zoning, article 5, supplementary regulations, section 1.31. The open area between such hedge and the street shall be landscaped in harmony with the landscaping prevailing on neighboring properties fronting on the same street. The hedge shall be at least two feet in height at the time of planting and shall grow to no more than four feet in height at the time of maturity. While the hedge is growing to a suitable height, an adjacent four foot high fence may be required by either the planning commission or city planner, according to the type of review required by appendix B, zoning, article 10, planning commission. 
7.24  Planning commission waiver. The planning commission may waive the requirement for the opaque barrier (wood fence, masonry wall, or earthen berm) and require only landscaping as required by section 7.22-Landscaping options in cases where noise is not a concern and the vegetation alone is considered a desirable aesthetic alternative. 
7.3  Arterial street buffers. Where nonresidential zoned property fronts on a principal arterial street, as designated by the comprehensive plan, a landscape buffer shall be required in addition to normal landscaping of the street right-of-way. This landscape buffer shall be required when the property is subject to site development plan review or site development master plan review by the planning commission according to appendix B, zoning, article 10, planning commission. Arterial street buffers shall be a minimum of 30 feet in depth, measured from the right-of-way line of the arterial street. 
7.31  Landscaping of arterial street buffers. At the time of development of the property, the arterial street buffer shall be planted with a variety of trees, shrubs and ground cover. The landscape design and planting plan for these arterial street buffers shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission as an integral part of the site development plan. 
7.32  Standards for arterial street buffer landscaping. Landscaping in arterial street buffers shall follow the landscape guidelines outlined in appendix B, zoning, article 5, supplementary regulations, section 15, landscape guidelines. Landscaping shall be designed to enhance the appearance of the arterial street, complement the architecture of buildings on site, and integrate with adjacent landscape areas. Landscape designs and planting plans which would pose a hazard to traffic on the arterial street, obstruct underground or overhead utilities or infrastructure, or significantly impede visibility of properties from the street shall be prohibited. 
7.33  Planning commission waiver. The planning commission may approve a buffer less than 30 feet in depth. In approving a lesser amount of buffering, the planning commission shall consider the following factors: 
a)  Whether there are specific constraints related to existing lot size, lot configuration or the orientation of existing buildings on adjoining properties that would severely limit the development potential of the property if a deep buffer was required. 
b)  Whether a deep or shallow buffer would cause the property to be out of character with the surrounding built environment. 
c)  Whether there is significant landscape area within the right-of-way of the arterial street itself that can contribute to the buffer, and whether future road improvement activities are likely to reduce the depth of this area. 
d)  Whether the landscape design and planting plan for the buffer achieve the standards of subsection 7.32-Standards for arterial street buffer landscaping. 
7.4  Outdoor storage trailers. Storage trailers accessory to an approved use shall be prohibited on a site, except when meeting the following conditions: 
1.  The total floor area of storage trailers shall be less than two percent of the gross floor area of the principal building. 
2.  All storage trailers shall be placed in accordance with all zoning regulations regarding permanent structures, including setbacks, parking, and other bulk regulations. 
3.  All such trailers shall be screened from public streets, and shall not be located between the principal building and the public road right-of-way. 
4.  Trailers placed during approved construction phases or those used as collection facilities for non-profit, governmental or philanthropic organizations shall not be calculated into floor area totals used to determine parking requirements, but must conform to setbacks and all other bulk regulations. 
5.  Storage trailers accessory to an approved use are to be temporary features on a site. No such trailer shall be in place for more than 18 months, except for those trailers to be used during construction or those used as collection facilities for non-profit, governmental or philanthropic organizations. 
7.5  Fences. Fences or walls shall be limited to a maximum height of four feet above the ground when situated within front yard areas, and shall be limited to a maximum height of eight feet above the ground when situated within side and rear yard areas. Fences situated on corner lots shall be subject to the provisions of article 5, section 1.3. For the purposes of this provision, on lots with dual street frontage that are not corner lots, a fence situated to the rear of the principal structure shall be limited to a maximum height of eight feet above ground. Fences or walls with a height in excess of eight feet above the ground shall conform to the setback requirements for dwelling buildings as set forth in article 4 of this Appendix. Fence material commonly referred to as "barbed wire" and/or "razor wire," or any similar material shall be prohibited along property lines which adjoin residential zones.

Section 8. - Performance standards. 
8.1  Dangerous and objectionable elements. No land or building in any zone shall be used or occupied in any manner so as to cause any one or more of the following conditions to exist and to be dangerous, injurious, noxious or offensive beyond the boundaries of such premises in such a manner or in such amount as to adversely affect the reasonable use of the surrounding area or adjoining premises: Fire, explosive or other hazard; noise, or vibration; smoke, dust, odor or other form of air pollution; heat, cold, dampness or electromagnetic disturbance; glare, liquid or solid refuse or waste; traffic congestion causing roadways or intersections in the surrounding highway network to fall below acceptable levels of comfort and convenience; or other substance, condition or element (referred to hereinafter as "dangerous or objectionable elements"), provided that any use permitted or not expressly prohibited by this ordinance may be undertaken and maintained if it conforms to the regulations of this section limiting dangerous and objectionable elements at the point of the determination of their existence. 
8.2  Uses requiring performance standards review procedure. Those uses in the C-3, IPM, IPM2, IPM3, and M zones and uses accessory thereto, which are specified as being subject to performance standards review procedure, are subject to the procedure specified in article 5, section 8.6 in obtaining a site plan approval. The city planner may require other uses, whether existing or proposed and regardless of the particular zoning district, to submit to the performance standards review procedure when there exists reasonable grounds to believe that a proposed use is in violation, or is likely to violate, the performance standards, in which event, the property owner shall comply with [the] performance standards review procedure. 
8.3  Enforcement provisions applicable to other uses. Even though compliance with the performance standards procedure in obtaining a site plan approval is not required for some proposed uses, initial and continuing compliance with the performance standards themselves is required of every use, and provisions for enforcement to ensure continued compliance with the performance standards shall be invoked by the city planner against the property owner, tenant, or other responsible party if there are reasonable grounds to believe that performance standards are being violated by a particular activity or use. 
8.4  Nonconforming uses. Certain uses established before the effective date of this ordinance and nonconforming as to performance standards shall be given a reasonable time in which to conform therewith, as provided in article 7, section 1.53. 
8.5  Performance standards regulations. Where the following regulations overlap regulations of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control or other state or local agencies, the more restrictive regulations shall apply in case of a conflict: 
8.51  Fire and explosion hazards. All activities involving, and all storage of, inflammable and explosive materials shall be provided at any point with adequate safety devices against the hazard of fire and explosion and adequate firefighting and fire suppression equipment and devices standard in the industry. Burning of waste materials in open fires is prohibited at any point. The relevant provisions of the state and local laws and regulations shall also apply. 
8.52  Radioactivity or electromagnetic disturbance. No activities shall be permitted which emit dangerous radioactivity at any point, or electromagnetic disturbance adversely affecting the operation at any point of any equipment other than that of the creator of such disturbance. 
8.53  Noise. The maximum sound pressure level radiated by any use or facility (other than transportation facilities open to the public) at the property line shall not exceed the values in the designated octave bands given in [the following] table I, after applying the corrections shown in [the following] table II. The sound pressure level shall be measured with a sound level meter and associated octave band analyzer conforming to standards prescribed by the American Standards Association (American Standard Sound Level Meters for Measurement of Noise and Other Sounds, Z243-1944, American Standards Association, Inc., New York, N.Y., and American Standard Specification for an Octave Band Filter Set for the Analysis of Noise and Other Sounds, Z24.10-1953, American Standards Association, Inc., New York, N.Y., shall be used).

*Apply one of these corrections only. 
8.54  Vibration. No vibration shall be permitted which is discernible without instruments at the property line. 
8.55  Smoke. No emission shall be permitted at any point, from any chimney or otherwise, of visible grey smoke of a shade equal to or darker than No. 2 on the Power's Micro-Ringlemann Chart, published by McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc., and copyrighted 1954 (being a direct facsimile reduction of the standard Ringlemann chart as issued by the United States Bureau of Mines), except that visible grey smoke of a shade equal to No. 2 on said chart may be emitted for four minutes in any 30 minutes. These provisions applicable to visible grey smoke shall also apply to visible smoke of a different color, but with an apparently equivalent opacity. Any emission shall be in conformance with air pollution regulations of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. 
8.56  Odors. No emission shall be permitted of odorous gases or other offensive odorous matter in such quantities as to be readily detectable when diluted in the ratio of one volume of odorous air emitted to four volumes of clean air. Any process which may involve the creation or emission of any offensive odors shall be provided with a secondary safeguard system, so that control will be maintained if the primary safeguard system should fail. There is hereby established as a guide in determining such quantities of offensive odors Table III, Odor Thresholds, in chapter 5, "Air Pollution Abatement Manual," copyright 1951 by Manufacturing Chemists' Association, Inc., Washington D.C., and said manual and/or table as subsequently amended. 
8.57  Fly ash, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, and other forms of air pollution. No emission shall be permitted which can cause any damage to health, to animals, vegetation, or other forms of property, or which can cause any excessive soiling, at any point, and/or which does not conform to air pollution regulations of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, and, in no event, any emission, from any chimney or otherwise, of any solid or liquid particles in concentrations exceeding 0.3 grain per cu. ft. of the conveying gas resulting from combustion. Standard corrections shall be applied to a stack temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit and 50 percent excess air. 
8.58  Glare. No direct or sky-reflected glare, whether from floodlights or from high-temperature processes such as combustion or welding or otherwise, shall be permitted. This restriction shall not apply to signs otherwise permitted by the provisions of this ordinance. 
8.59  Liquid or solid wastes. No discharge shall be permitted at any point into any public sewer, private sewage disposal system or stream, or into the ground, except in accord with standards approved by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, of any materials of such nature or temperature as can contaminate any water supply or otherwise cause the emission of dangerous or offensive elements. 
8.60  Traffic congestion. When, in the surrounding highway network, operating conditions are at or near the design capacity level beyond which would result in functional failure of the surrounding highway network. All speeds are reduced to a low, but relatively uniform value. Freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream is extremely difficult, and it is generally accomplished by forcing a vehicle or pedestrian to "give way" to accommodate such maneuvers. Comfort and convenience levels are extremely poor, and driver or pedestrian frustration is generally high. Operations at this level are usually unstable, because small increases in flow or minor perturbations within the traffic stream will cause functional failures beyond acceptable levels. (The conditions described in this [sub]section are also used to describe "level of service E" as defined by the highway capacity manual developed by the transportation research board, dated 1985.) 
8.6  Performance standard procedure. 
8.61  Application. An application for a site plan approval shall be accompanied with a performance standard review application when a use or occupancy is required, and shall be referred by the city planner to the planning commission. The applicant shall also submit, in an amount equal to the required number of site plan submissions, a plan of the proposed construction or development, including a description of the proposed machinery, operations, and products, and specifications for the mechanisms and techniques to be used in restricting the emission of dangerous and objectionable elements referred to in article 5, section 8.1, in accordance with rules prescribed by the planning commission specifying the type of information required in such plans and specifications, and an affidavit by the applicant acknowledging his understanding of the applicable performance standards and agreement to conform with same at all times. 
No applicant will be required to reveal any secret processes, and any information submitted will be treated as confidential if requested. The fee for such application shall include the cost of the special reports required to process it, described below. 
8.62  Report by expert consultants. The planning commission, if there is any reasonable doubt as to the likelihood of conformance, shall refer the application for investigation and report to one or more expert consultants qualified to advise as to whether a proposed use will conform to the applicable performance standards specified herein. Such consultant or consultants shall make such report within 30 days after his or their receipt of such application. A copy of such report shall be promptly furnished to the applicant. 
8.63  Decision of the planning commission. At the next regular meeting of the planning commission, but in no event more than 30 days after the board has received the aforesaid report, or within such further period as agreed to by the applicant, the board shall decide whether the proposed use will conform to the applicable performance standards and, on such basis, shall authorize or refuse to authorize the issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy, or require a modification of the proposed plan of construction. Such decision of the commission shall be in the form of a written report. Any building permit or certificate of occupancy so authorized and issued shall be conditioned on, among other things: 
(i)  The applicant's completed buildings and installations in operation conforming to the applicable performance standards, and 
(ii)  The applicant's paying the fees for services of the expert consultant or consultants deemed reasonable and necessary by the planning commission for advice as to whether or not the applicant's completed buildings and installations will, in operation, conform to the applicable performance standards.

Section 9. - Development in stages. 
    Preliminary or final site plan approval may be granted in stages if the following criteria are met: 
9.1 The development schedule must be approved by the planning commission. 
9.2 Each stage submitted for site plan approval shall include not less than 20 percent of the total number of dwelling units for a residential development, or 20 percent of the total floor area, for a nonresidential development, which are proposed in the overall development plan. 
9.3 The landscaping for each stage shall be 70 percent complete before final site plan approval is granted for the next stage. 
9.4 In residential developments, the establishment of the common open space as detailed in the development plan must proceed concurrently with construction of the dwelling units, and must be completed no later than six months after the construction of all dwelling units. 
9.5 In residential developments, the gross residential density for each stage, in addition to all preceding stages, may not exceed the approved gross density for the total development by more than 20 percent. 
Section 10. - Open space, recreation and other public facilities. 
    The City of Dover shall require the reservation of open space, recreation and other public facilities in accordance with the provisions of this section as a condition of approval for all one-family dwelling, two-family dwelling and multiple-family dwelling residential developments requiring conditional use approval, site development plan approval, or land subdivision approval by the City of Dover Planning Commission. 
10.1  Recreation areas. 
10.11  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure that active recreation areas are provided as an integral design element within residential developments and that such facilities are of an adequate scale in relation to the size of the residential development and which provide residents with a variety of active recreational pursuits. 
10.12  Dedication required. The commission shall require the dedication or reservation of recreation areas, and the subsequent construction of recreation facilities of a character, extent and location suitable to the needs created by a development for recreation facilities as defined and in accordance with the design guidelines set forth. 
10.13  Definition. The following are illustrative of the types of recreation areas and subsequent facilities that shall be deemed to serve active recreational needs and therefore to count toward satisfaction of the recreation area requirements of this section: tennis courts, handball courts, racquetball courts, swimming pools, saunas and exercise rooms, meeting or activity rooms within clubhouses, baseball and soccer fields, basketball courts, volleyball courts, swings, slides and play apparatus, and developed walking, jogging or biking trails. 
10.14  Recreation area review. 
10.141  Presubmission conference. Prior to the submission of a development plan, the applicant or his representative shall meet in person with the city manager or his appointee and the city planner to receive early advice and consultation on the proposed development and the proposed recreation facilities, including the size, type and layout. 
10.142  Review with parks, recreation, and community enhancement committee. Upon receipt of the submitted development plan, the city manager or his appointee shall consult with the city council parks, recreation, and community enhancement committee. 
10.143  Report to planning commission. Upon consultation with the committee, the city manager or his designee shall submit to the planning commission, through the development advisory committee, a report detailing the recommendations as to the active recreation facilities to be recommended and their location, related parking areas, and proposed landscaping. 
10.15  Design guidelines. 
10.151  Accessible. Recreation areas shall be accessible within the development and arranged in a manner which affords reasonable access to all residents within the development. When warranted, recreation areas can be dispersed throughout the development, provided that each remote location is accessible. 
10.152  Pedestrian oriented. Recreation areas shall be pedestrian oriented and designed with linkages to existing and planned public walkways and with other existing or planned recreation areas. 
10.153  Age oriented. The nature and scope of planned recreation areas shall reflect an awareness of, and sensitivity toward, the anticipated age groups that would reside within the proposed development. 
10.154  Parking. Designs consider the need for parking facilities associated with recreation areas.

10.25  Area required. In no case shall the commission require that more than five percent of the gross area of the development be so dedicated or reserved. 
10.3  Public facilities. 
10.31  Purpose. The purpose of this [sub]section [10.3] is to afford the city the opportunity to reserve lands within developing areas which represent important and strategic locations for the distribution of essential public goods and services. 
10.32  Dedication optional. Where public facilities are shown or proposed in the city comprehensive plan, or in any other plan or study accepted by the city council or other public body, and are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision or site plan, the commission may require the dedication or reservation of the area required in lieu of the requirements of [sub]section 10.1. 
10.33  Definition. The following are illustrative of the types of public facilities that may be considered for reservation or dedication by this [sub]section [10.3]: schools, utility service lines, future road rights-of-way (other than those planned to serve the proposed development), public buildings, parks, public trails, and recreation facilities. 
10.34  Area required. In no case shall the commission require that more than five percent of the gross area of the development be dedicated for the public facility. Area dedications shall only be allowed when the facility is to be dedicated to the City of Dover for facilities to be operated by the city. 
10.35  Reservation. Any areas required by any other public bodies or any remaining areas beyond the five percent dedicated to the city under [sub]section 10.34 may be set aside by the commission for a period of one year to allow the proper authority the opportunity to purchase the area. Upon failure of the proper authorities to purchase such site within one year after the date of the final approval of the project, the developer, upon application, shall be relieved of the responsibility of reserving such land for public purposes. 
10.4  Management and maintenance of common open space and recreational areas. 
10.41  Management and maintenance required. There shall be provisions which ensure that the common open space land and all public facilities not dedicated to the City of Dover shall continue as such and be properly maintained. These provisions shall be in a form acceptable to the City of Dover. The developer shall either (a) retain ownership and responsibility for maintenance of such open land; or (b) provide for and establish one or more organizations for the ownership and maintenance of all common open space. In the case of (b) above, each organization shall be a nonprofit homeowners' corporation, unless the developer demonstrates that a community open space trust is a more appropriate form of organization.

Section 11. - Environmental protection. 
11.1  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect public health and safety by ensuring that environmental standards for water, air, and soil in the City of Dover adequately address current practices in the realm of environmental protection. Further, it is the intent of this section to protect environmentally sensitive land as well as the plants and animals that reside on that land. 
11.2  Environmentally sensitive areas and scarce resources. All land areas which contain one of the following natural features or combination of these features shall be considered to be an environmentally sensitive area or an area of scarce resources subject to specific requirements for environmental protection and conservation: flood hazard areas, steep slopes, water bodies and wetlands, wet soils, woodlands, significant wildlife habitats, prime agricultural soils, designated scenic areas, and natural areas and nature preserves identified in the comprehensive plan. 
11.21  Flood hazard areas. All flood hazard areas shall remain as natural open space, except for the construction of roads authorized by the City of Dover and/or the Delaware Department of Transportation. 
a)  For the purposes of this section, natural open space is defined as an area of land that excludes buildings, structures, and impervious surface from being constructed on or located within the area. For evaluating flood hazard areas, patios, cement slabs, sidewalks, and other similar constructs are considered to be structures and are similarly prohibited. 
11.211  Redevelopment. Existing uses or buildings located within a flood hazard area are considered to be nonconforming structures and are subject to the following requirements if redevelopment occurs on properties within the flood hazard area. 
a)  Nonresidential uses existing in a flood hazard area seeking to redevelop a property under the requirements of Appendix B-Zoning, Article 10-Planning Commission, are required to reduce impervious surfaces for the lot by 15 percent from the preredevelopment conditions. 
b)  For nonresidential uses where less than 33 percent of the total lot area is located within a flood hazard area, the planning commission may waive or reduce the amount of required reduction in impervious surfaces. For projects being reviewed under administrative site plan review, the city planner may waive or reduce the amount of required reduction in impervious surface for projects where less than 33 percent of the total lot area is located within a flood hazard area. 
c)  New residential building construction or additions of impervious surface are not permitted in pervious areas of the flood hazard area. 
11.22  Water bodies and wetlands. Water bodies and wetlands shall be left as permanent open space. No development, filling, piping or diverting shall be permitted, except for required roads, to be approved by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and/or the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. Within these same areas, the clearing or removal of natural ground cover or vegetation, including the cultivation of the soil for agricultural purposes, is prohibited. 
11.221  [Water bodies identified.] For the purposes of this section, the following, as depicted on the most recent USGS Topographic Maps, shall be defined as water bodies: Cahoon Branch, Dover Run, Fork Branch, Little River, Maidstone Branch, McKee Run, Morgan Branch, Muddy Branch, Puncheon Run, Silver Lake, and St. Jones River. 
11.222  Setbacks. All buildings, structures, and impervious surfaces shall be set back at least 100 feet from the top of bank from wetland areas greater than 0.25 acres in size and from all water bodies. Patios, cement slabs, sidewalks, and other similar constructs are considered to be impervious surfaces. Within this 100-foot setback, vegetative ground cover is required. This setback may be reduced under the conditions set forth as follows: 

a)  [Riparian buffer.] The setback may be reduced to 50 feet from the top of bank provided that a riparian buffer is established in the setback, consisting of native vegetation. (See figure 11-1) 
b)  [Bank stabilization.] The setback may be reduced to 30 feet from the top of bank provided that a riparian buffer is established in the setback, consisting of native vegetation and provided that bank stabilization is implemented through the planting of native species. (See figure 11-1) 
c)  [Single-family residential uses.] Single-family residential uses may reduce the setback requirement to 75 feet of the top of bank. 
d)  Removal of buffer plantings without approval. The removal of native vegetation or plantings required for the purposes of riparian buffers for any purpose whatsoever, except the establishment of pathways (not greater than eight feet in width), shall be prohibited unless approved by the planning commission through the site plan, conditional use, or subdivision review process. 
e)  [Replacement plantings.] Plantings in a riparian buffer that are removed without permission must be replaced with similar plantings within 30 days of removal. The City Planner may extend this time frame where and if weather conditions necessitate a delay. 
f)  Exceptions to the setback requirements. Stairs, ramps, open decks, patios, fences, and docks necessary for access to natural features with a combined total of 200 square feet in size are exempt from the setback restrictions. Paved trails and sidewalks of up to six feet in width or less are exempt from the setback restrictions as defined in this section. 
11.23  Wet soils. No construction shall be permitted where the seasonally high water table is within two and one-half feet of the surface unless crawl space, piles or slab on grade with provisions to prevent water seepage will be used to prevent water damage to the building. The proposed construction techniques must be approved by the building inspector in accordance with City of Dover Building Code and must meet or exceed the standards of the Federal Housing Administration. 
No basements or cellars shall be permitted to be constructed below the seasonal high water table, unless special measures are taken to prevent water damage to the building. Such measures must be approved by the building inspector in accordance with City of Dover Building Code and must meet or exceed the standards of the Federal Housing Administration. 
11.231  Requirements for development applications. Site development applications appearing before the planning commission must include either a wetland delineation prepared by a licensed/registered soil scientist, wetlands scientist, or professional engineer in accordance with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers standards; or provide a statement from the design professional that no wetlands are present on the site. 
11.232  Requirements for major subdivision applications. Subdivision plans must identify the seasonal high water table on each lot if basements are proposed for those lots. A licensed Class D Soil Scientist is required to determine the seasonal high water table and this information must be displayed on the subdivision plat. This information must also be present in the deed and plot plan for each property. Basements may be prohibited where severe groundwater conditions exist. 
a)  A lot specific study may be substituted for the recorded seasonal high water table as per the subdivision plan. 
11.24  Significant wildlife habitat. Natural features that constitute significant wildlife habitats are considered to be environmentally sensitive features and a scarce resource deserving of protection. The natural features that typically provide significant wildlife habitat include wetlands and marsh areas that provide nesting and breeding grounds for waterfowl and support a wide variety of aquatic life; wooded areas in general, but most especially the edges of the wooded areas adjacent to open fields and along stream corridors; freshwater marsh and wetland areas, old fields and hedgerows; and natural areas of grasses and shrubs along the edges of open fields, drainage channels and wetlands. Applications for subdivision plan and site development plan approval shall include the identification of all areas and features which constitute significant wildlife habitat as part of the documentation of existing site conditions. The protection and preservation of wildlife habitat shall be considered by the planning commission in development review. 
11.25  Scenic resources. Scenic resources shall consist of the following: mature woodlands and most especially the edges of wooded areas adjacent to open fields, wetlands or urbanized areas; other areas of mature natural vegetation such as marsh grasses; the historic district and areas listed on the National Register of Historic Places ; and freestanding historic buildings and sites and other buildings or districts of the city exhibiting particular architectural or visual merit buildings and places of special public or cultural significance, and significant views and view corridors to buildings or places of architectural, visual, public or cultural value and to attractive natural areas. Application for subdivision plan or site development plan approval shall include, as a part of the documentation of existing site conditions, the presence of and location of all scenic resources. The preservation and enhancement of the scenic resources potentially affected by the proposed development shall be considered by the planning commission in development review. 
11.251  Silver Lake. All Site Plan, Conditional Use Site Plan, or Subdivision applications for parcels where any boundary of the parcel is abutting Silver Lake are required to go before the Silver Lake commission prior to appearing before the planning commission. The Silver Lake commission shall provide advisory comments for the planning commission on such applications. 
11.26  Combinations of environmentally sensitive features and scarce resources. Wherever more than one environmentally sensitive feature or scarce resource is present on a site in combination, special care shall be taken in both the documentation of existing conditions on a site being considered for development and in the planning commission's review of a specific subdivision plan or site development plan application. 
In general, the use of available development options such as planned neighborhood design and traditional neighborhood design is strongly encouraged to take advantage of the design and the planning feasibility in new development projects afforded by these options to preserve and protect environmentally sensitive features and the natural processes associated with these features to the maximum extent possible. 
11.3  Stormwater management. All development must be designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with State of Delaware Sediment and Stormwater regulations. The planning commission may require stormwater management in excess of the minimum regulations in areas with documented drainage problems upon concurrence with the Kent Conservation District, State of Delaware, or the City Engineer.

Section 14. - Child day care facilities. 
14.1  General. In order to promote the development of quality child care outside of the home (day care facilities), the following two basic assumptions have been made: 
14.11 The establishment of child day care services and facilities, wherever there is a need, is a necessary public objective; and 
14.12 Day care programs for children shall be treated as community facilities and shall be permitted to locate in any zoning district, provided that need has been demonstrated, state licensing requirements have been met and no physical hazard to children can be reasonably anticipated. 
14.2  Definitions. 
    Child day care facility. For the purposes of this ordinance, the facilities described furnishing care, supervision and guidance of a child or group of children unaccompanied by a parent or guardian, for periods of less than 24 hours per day shall be defined as follows: 
14.21  Child day care center. 
(a)  Any place, other than an occupied residence, which receives children for compensation for day care or large family day care home; and 
(b)  Any occupied residence which receives 13 or more children for compensation for day care. 
Child day care centers shall be required to obtain conditional use approval by the planning commission in accordance with the procedures and subject to the general conditions set forth in article 10 and to any specified requirement set forth in subsection 14.3 below, except in zoning districts where listed as a permitted use. 
14.22  Family day care home-children. An occupied residence in which a person provides care for children other than his/her own family and the children of close relatives for compensation. Such care in a family day care home is limited to that care given to six or fewer children with a maximum of three children allowed for after school care. Such child care facility shall be permitted as an accessory use in all residential zones and shall be exempt from obtaining a conditional use permit and site plan approval. 
14.23  Large family day care home-children . A facility which provides child care for more than six, but less than 13 children. This care may be offered in a private home or in a property converted to the purpose of providing child day care. This form of day care facility requires the submission of a site plan application in accordance with the procedures and subject to article 10, section 2 of the zoning ordinance. If a large family day care home is not to be located in an occupied residence, then a conditional use site plan application shall be required in accordance with article 10 section 1 of the zoning ordinance. 
14.3  Zoning criteria. 
14.31  Number of children. Day care centers shall be limited to a maximum of 50 children in all residential zones. 
14.32  Outdoor play area. Must meet the state requirement for day care centers.

14.34  Signage for child day care facilities. 
(a)  Signs in residential zones. 
i.  Family day care homes-children and large family day care homes-children. One wall-mounted sign limited to two square feet. 
ii.  Child day care center. One sign, wall-mounted or freestanding, limited in area to 12 square feet. The planning commission shall consider the location of such sign as part of the conditional use review and may approve a lesser amount of sign area if deemed necessary by the commission to protect the general health, safety and welfare of the public in general and the residents of the immediate neighborhood in particular. 
(b)  Signs in nonresidential zones. Child day care centers within nonresidential zoning districts shall be governed by the sign regulations in effect for the particular nonresidential zoning district in which the day care center is located. 
14.35  Licensing requirements. Child day care facilities must meet state licensing standards and must be inspected by the City of Dover Fire Marshal's Office. A City of Dover Business License and a Public Occupancy Permit is required.

Editor's note- The subsections of this section have been numbered by the editor to retain format. 
Section 15. - Landscape guidelines. 
    The following guidelines shall be used in the design of site landscape as required in other sections of this ordinance and shall be followed unless it can be demonstrated through the site plan review process that such features would be impractical or incompatible with a particular land use or site development proposal. Failure to maintain required landscaping shall constitute a violation of this ordinance and is subject to, as specified in article 8, section 4, violations and penalties: 
15.1 Trees of substantial size shall be provided to create a sense of scale and an overhead canopy. Where trees are set in paving, flush tree grates or open planters shall be used to protect root zones without interrupting the ground plane. 
15.2 Large shrubs, small trees and evergreens are most effective for foundation planting around buildings, emphasizing major vehicular entrances and areas requiring visual screening. Avoid using large, dense plant material where maximum visibility is imperative. 
15.3 Security and visibility are important considerations in landscape design along commercial corridors. Understory plant materials shall be confined to 36 inches or lower and trees shall be limbed to above 12 feet at maturity to allow for visual surveillance. 
15.4 Color and specimen material shall be targeted to a few key locations. A few highly visible masses of color will be more effective than numerous small patches dispersed over the entire site. 
15.5 Massing of plant material, or large groups of a single species is preferred over planting a large area with numerous species. Trees and shrubbery shall be used in scale with corridor development and large open spaces to create visual balance. 
15.6 Grading shall be level, except to allow for necessary surface drainage and earth berms used for screening purposes. 
15.7 Lawn areas shall be contained and separated from landscaped beds with defined edging such as concrete walks, steel edging or curbing. 
15.8 Entrances shall be provided with landscaping to define the entrance location and to establish the site entrance as part of the overall landscape. 
15.9 Landscape plantings shall be placed at least 10 feet away from all underground utilities and infrastructure, as measured from the trunk of the planting. Plantings located within 10 feet of overhead utilities or infrastructure shall be of a species that does not grow to the height of the lowest equipment overhead. Placement of all plantings must minimize conflict with required servicing of utilities and infrastructure.

The purpose of this section is to establish standards and requirements for the protection and planting of trees and woodlands because it is recognized that woodlands and trees are not only desirable, but are essential to the health, safety, and welfare of the population in that they provide oxygen, reduce carbon dioxide, stabilize soil, cleanse the air by transpiring clean water into the atmosphere, cleanse water passing into the ground through the root system, provide protection for wildlife and their habitats, provide shade, reduce noise and glare, increase property values, and provide an important physical, aesthetic, and psychological balance to the built environment. 
16.2  Definitions. 
    Caliper dimension. The term "caliper dimension" means an outside diameter measurement of the trunk of a tree measured at a vertical distance of three feet above grade. 
    Clearing. The removal of trees from an area of 5,000 square feet or greater, whether by cutting or other means. The term "clearing" shall not include the removal of trees for landscaping purposes by individual lot owners. 
    Development area. The area containing all new site features (buildings, parking and drive areas, pedestrian walks, stormwater management areas, buffer areas etc. but not underground utilities) proposed by a plan. The development area shall be delineated using property lines and lines run straight across the property from one property line to another without bending or curving. 
    Design professional. The term "design professional" shall be any person licensed as a landscape architect or architect, or Delaware certified nursery professional. 
    Dripline. A line on the ground established by a vertical plane extending from a tree's outermost branch tips to the ground, i.e., the line enclosing the area directly beneath the tree's crown, from which rainfall would drip. 
    Tree. Any self-supporting, woody perennial plant, usually having a main stem or trunk and many branches and at maturity normally attaining a trunk diameter greater than three inches at any point and height of over ten feet. 
    Tree protection area. Any portion of a site wherein are located existing trees which are proposed to be retained in order to comply with the requirements of this section. The tree protection area shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree canopy as defined by the dripline of the tree or group of trees collectively. 
    Woodland. An area of contiguous wooded vegetation (7,500 square feet or greater), where trees exist at a density of at least one tree with a caliper dimension of six inches or greater per 375 square feet of land and where the tree branches form a contiguous canopy. 
16.3  Applicability. The terms and provisions of this section shall apply to any activity on real property which requires conditional use, site plan or subdivision approval of the planning commission as set forth in article 10, except the provisions in [sub]section 16.4 which shall apply to all real property. 
16.4  Tree preservation. 
16.41  Trees required by planning commission to be replaced. Trees required by the planning commission as a part of a conditional use, subdivision, or site plan approval shall not be removed unless they are diseased or infested, or present a danger to life and property. In cases where such trees are removed, they must be replaced with a tree planting in accordance with the table of trees standards kept in the office of the city planner. 
16.42  Trees of special value. Trees having an historic value, as determined by the state historic preservation officer, or that are of an outstanding nature due to type or species, age, or other professional criteria, may be required by the planning commission to be preserved. Such trees may be prohibited from being removed by the city planner until such time that the planning commission has granted approval to remove such trees. 
16.43  Tree preservation in wetlands. No portions of wetland areas shall be developed or cleared of vegetation unless granted permission under state and/or federal permit; and they shall remain as essentially undisturbed areas protected under the provisions set forth in subsection 16.7. 
16.44  Clearing prohibited without approval. Clearing, as defined by this section, for any purpose whatsoever, except the establishment of trails and pathways (not greater than eight feet in width) and open yard areas, shall be prohibited unless approved by the planning commission through the site plan, conditional use, or subdivision review process. 
16.5  Woodland preservation. 
16.51  Tree preservation and selective clearing plan required. All site development proposals which involve the development of woodland areas and require planning commission approval shall include a tree preservation and selective clearing plan as part of the submission plan. The tree preservation and selective clearing plan shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions of subsection 16.5, subsection 16.7 and subsection 16.8 of this section. 
16.52  Limited clearing for site development allowed. Generally, site development plans for the construction of a new building within existing woodland areas shall limit clearing of the land to those areas necessary to provide for the placement of the building or group of buildings, adequate access onto the property and to the proposed building or group of buildings, utility placement, off-street parking and yard areas to allow for daylight infiltration and building maintenance. When woodland areas are proposed to be cleared to allow for new construction, clearing within the area of the proposed construction shall be limited to an area of 30 feet from proposed building foundation, and 15 feet from off-street parking lots, and utility placement. 
16.53  Maximum clearing requirement. Specifically, no more than 50 percent of a lot, parcel or tract of land occupied by woodland vegetation may be cleared for any purpose. 
16.54  Reserved. 
16.6  Tree preservation and planting in nonwoodlands. 
16.61  Tree preservation and planting plan required. All developments requiring approval of the planning commission shall be required to submit, with its application and plans, a tree preservation and planting plan as set forth in subsection 16.8, and shall conform with the following provisions. 
16.62  Tree density. For each property required to submit a tree preservation and planting plan, a development area as defined in this section shall be delineated within the nonwoodland area of the property. Within this development area, existing trees may be retained and new trees shall be planted such that the development area shall attain or exceed a tree density of one tree per 3,000 square feet or fraction thereof. 
16.63  Minimum standards for new trees. For new trees to be counted toward the required tree density, they must be of a species and size as set forth in the table of trees approved by the planning commission and kept on file in the office of the city planner, or be of an alternate species found acceptable by the commission. 
16.64  Minimum standards for existing trees. For existing trees to be counted toward the required tree density, the tree shall have a minimum caliper dimension of two inches. No trees over eight inches in caliper dimension shall be removed unless within an area of 30 feet from the proposed building foundation, off-street parking lot, and utility placement. 
16.7  Tree protection and planting requirements. 
16.71  Application. The following guidelines and standards shall apply to activities regulated under article 5, section 15 of this ordinance: 
16.72  Protection required. To protect the required trees or woodland and their critical root zone, a tree protection area delineated by the dripline of a tree or group of trees to be retained, shall be established. The protection area shall not be disturbed by site utility and grading work, by construction activities such as parking, material storage, concrete washout, sedimentation intrusion or erosion, or other activity. Damage to trees or woodlands and their critical root zones shall require tree plans to be revised to compensate for the loss as determined by the building inspector. 
16.73  Protection measures. Tree protection areas shall be protected by fencing, staking, or continuous ribbon and, where necessary, silt screens which shall be situated to coincide with the dripline of the tree or group of trees to be preserved. Protection measures shall be erected prior to construction, and must remain until final landscaping is installed. 
16.74  Planting requirements. New trees proposed to be planted for credit toward the density requirement shall have spacing that is compatible with the spatial site limitations and with responsible consideration toward species size when mature. Species selected for planting must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing site. Trees selected for planting shall be free from injury, pest, disease, and disorders. 
16.8  Tree preservation, planting and selective clearing plans. 
16.81  Plan specifications. A tree preservation and planting plan or a preservation and selective clearing plan, prepared by or in conjunction with a design professional, shall be shown on a copy of a preliminary plat, sketch, or site plan, as appropriate to the proposed development, drawn to the same scale and covering the same area as the other plan documents prepared for the planning commission hearing. The plan may be combined with a required buffer and landscape plan for the project, at the option of the developer. The plan shall provide sufficient information and detail to clearly demonstrate that all applicable requirements and standards of this section will be fully satisfied. The plan shall contain, but need not be limited to, the following: 
a.  Project name, zone, parcel number, north arrow and scale. 
b.  Developer's name, address and telephone number. 
c.  Name, address, and telephone number of the design professional responsible for the preparation of the plan.

f.  Delineation of all wetlands and woodlands. 
g.  Designation and delineation of all lots in nonwoodland areas expected to retain existing trees to meet the tree density requirement. 
h.  Approximate location and description of the protective tree fencing, staking, or continuous ribbon to be installed which, at a minimum, shall follow the dripline of all trees to be retained along adjoining areas of clearing, grading, or other construction activity. 
i.  The location, spacing, caliper dimension, and species of new trees proposed to meet tree density requirements. 
j.  Measures to be taken to avoid sedimentation intrusions and erosion in tree protection areas, and the location of such devices. 
k.  A summary table of the number of new trees to be planted and minimum number of existing trees to be retained to meet the tree density requirement, if any, along with calculations showing that the tree density requirement has been achieved. Groupings of trees in the tree protection areas for new trees may be keyed to the summary table by area rather than having each tree individually labeled on the plan. 
l.  There shall be a note on the plan indicating that a one-year full price replacement guarantee on all new trees planted is held by the applicant. 
16.9  Tree mitigation. 
16.91  Planning commission waiver. The planning commission may waive the provisions of subsections 16.52, 16.53, and 16.62, and require replacement planting for mitigation purposes should the planning commission determine, after demonstration by the applicant, that due to physical limitations of the land which would otherwise prohibit the reasonable use of the land, or for purposes of preserving, protecting and promoting the interest of public health, safety, welfare and/or public convenience. All tree mitigation plantings must occur within the corporate limits of the City of Dover. Tree mitigation may occur off-site in accordance with the provisions listed below in this ordinance: 
(a)  If a waiver is sought from the provisions of subsection 16.62, new tree plantings are required at a rate of 1:1. All new tree plantings shall meet the minimum size at planting requirements of the City of Dover table of trees. 
(b)  If a waiver is sought from the provisions of subsection 16.52 and/or subsection 16.53, then mitigation must be in the form of newly created woodland areas. New woodlands shall be created at a rate of 1.25 times the amount of woodlands to be removed. A woodland mitigation plan shall be prepared by a licensed forester, landscape architect, or certified nursery professional, for the consideration of the planning commission. 
(c)  All tree mitigation must occur on-site unless an off-site location is specifically approved by the planning commission. When considering off-site locations for tree mitigation, the commission shall consider: 
1)  A physical hardship related to the land which would otherwise prohibit compliance on the subject site; 
2)  Whether the mitigation plan proposed by the applicant is superior in terms of environmental benefits, tree quantity, or aesthetic qualities compared to strict compliance with the ordinance on-site. 
16.92  Tree mitigation required for unauthorized clearing. In the event that trees or woodland areas to be preserved under this ordinance or as a condition of a site plan, subdivision, or conditional use approval are illegally removed, tree mitigation shall be required. All tree mitigation plantings must be placed on the same lot, parcel, or tract on which the illegal clearing occurred, except as noted below. All replacement trees must be of the same or a similar variety as the trees illegally removed. 
(a)  If trees have been removed from non-woodland areas, new tree plantings shall be provided in accordance with the table below: 
Caliper Dimension 
of Trees Removed Number of 
Trees Required Caliper dimension 
at Planting 25? or larger 5 trees 3? 17? to 24? 3 trees 3? 9? to 16? 3 trees 3? 8? or less 2 trees 3?  
*  Note -All trees replanted must be guaranteed to survive a minimum of one year. 
(b)  If trees have been removed from woodland areas, then mitigation must be in the form of newly created woodland areas. New woodlands shall be created at a rate of 1.75 times the amount of woodlands that were illegally removed. The woodland unlawfully removed must be replanted to satisfy a portion of this requirement. A woodland mitigation plan shall be prepared by a licensed forester, landscape architect, or certified nursery professional, for review and approval by the city planner. 
(c)  If the applicant wishes to provide replacement plantings on any property other than the one on which illegal clearing occurred, the mitigation plan must be reviewed and approved by the planning commission. When considering off-site locations for tree mitigation, the commission shall consider: 
1)  A physical hardship related to the land which would otherwise prohibit compliance on the subject site; 
2)  Whether the mitigation plan proposed by the applicant is superior in terms of environmental benefits, tree quantity, or aesthetic qualities compared to strict compliance with the ordinance on-site.

Editor's note- An ordinance adopted July 13, 1992, added provisions designated as app. B, art. 5, § 15. In order to avoid duplicative section numbering, such provisions have been redesigned as app. B, art. 5, § 16, at the discretion of the editor. 
Section 17. - Emergency access requirements. 
(1)  General purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish standards and requirements for the fire protection of structures and inhabitants by providing emergency vehicle access to structures that enable the City of Dover Bureau of Fire to approach and attack fires in such a way that there is a reduced threat to the lives and safety of citizens. 
(2)  Waiver. Should the planning commission determine, after demonstration by an applicant, that alternative means of fire protection can be provided which are equivalent to or greater than the public safety protection provided by this ordinance, then the planning commission may recommend to [the] city council to waive certain provisions of this ordinance that are not required under other city or state laws. 
(3)  Fire lanes. 
(a)  Primary and secondary fire lanes shall be provided with all new construction in accordance with the requirement of the State of Delaware Fire Protection Regulations and in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. Where the State of Delaware Fire Protection Regulations conflict with the provisions of these regulations, the more stringent regulation shall prevail. 
(b)  The owner of record of the property containing any primary or secondary fire lane shall be responsible for proper maintenance of such fire lanes in accordance with the provisions of the State of Delaware Fire Protection Regulations and all applicable regulations of the City of Dover. 
(4)  Subgrade emergency access lanes. 
(a)  A subgrade emergency access lane is designed to provide emergency vehicle accessibility in lieu of paved, hard-surfaced fire lanes where permitted under subsection 5 [(5)](a) of this section. A subgrade emergency access lane shall not be substituted for a required secondary fire lane. 
(b)  All subgrade emergency access lanes shall be established at a minimum width of 18 feet and shall be set back from all building walls in accordance with the Delaware State Fire Protection Regulations. The planning commission may waive the 18-foot width requirement when demarcation is enhanced beyond the standards set forth in paragraph [subsection (4)](d) below. 
(c)  All subgrade emergency access lanes shall be constructed on a level subgrade compacted to at least 2,000 pounds per square foot. The compacted subgrade shall be overlaid with three to four inches of compacted crusher run (CR1-2.5?) underneath four inches of compacted crusher run (CR6-1.5?) to form a compacted subbase. The compacted subbase shall be covered with at least four inches of topsoil and shall be graded and seeded or sodded. (See figure 17.1.) 
(d)  All subgrade emergency access lanes shall be designated and identified by shrub plantings, fencing, signage or any combination of materials to adequately delineate such access way, subject to approval by the City of Dover Fire Marshal. When shrub plantings are to be used for lane demarcation, such plantings shall be evergreen and of a columnar, upright form, with [a] tight branching habit. Shrub planting selection shall be subject to final approval by the city planner. Demarcation shrub plantings shall be spaced no greater than 40 feet on center on straight sections of access lane and no greater than 20 feet on center on curved sections. 
(e)  All subgrade emergency access lanes shall be maintained free of obstruction. The placement of fences, buildings, landscaping, gardens, play equipment or any other form of obstruction shall be prohibited from placement within the boundaries of subgrade emergency access lanes. The area reserved for [an] emergency access lane shall be subject to all property maintenance ordinances of the City of Dover, including those governing grass cutting, and landscape maintenance. Violations are punishable as misdemeanor offenses under the applicable ordinances of the City of Dover. 
(f)  At points of access to subgrade emergency access lanes, there shall be provided an adequate curb depression of at least 24 feet in width. Such access points shall be designated as restricted use and controlled by signage, pavement marking, gates or fencing to prevent the use of such lane for purposes other than emergency vehicle access. The methods employed to ensure controlled access shall be reviewed, approved and inspected by the fire marshal on a case by case basis prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for associated buildings. 
(5)  Rear access requirements. 
(a)  Emergency access to rear building areas shall be provided for various residential dwelling types in accordance with the following matrix:

Section 18. - Pedestrian, bicycle, and multi-modal access requirements. 
18.1  Purpose . The purpose of this section is to establish standards and requirements for the construction of transportation networks for pedestrians, bicyclists, and other users of non-motorized forms of transit, in order to ensure safe and convenient multi-modal access to all development within the City of Dover. Sidewalks, multi-use paths, and other hard paved trails, whether adjacent to a roadway or not, shall be referred to collectively as "pathways" within this section. It is the intent of this section that all new pathways installed shall be designed to a standard commensurate with existing and expected future multi-modal traffic volumes, recognizing that the convenience of a growing network of such pathways citywide will encourage residents and visitors to use non-motorized means of travel to reach their destinations. 
18.2  Applicability . Sidewalks or other pathways according to the requirements of this section shall be installed on a property by the property owner or developer under the following circumstances: 
a)  When the property is part of a development proposal which is subject to planning commission site development plan review. 
b)  When the property is part of a development proposal which is subject to planning commission site development master plan review. 
c)  When the property is part of a request for a conditional use permit which also requires site development plan review or site development master plan review. 
d)  When the property is part of a development proposal which is subject to administrative site plan review, provided the proposal involves construction of an entire new building. 
18.3  Pathway design standards and location requirements . Pathways shall meet the following minimum standards and requirements in order to allow for pedestrian access: 
a)  Public street frontage . Standard City of Dover sidewalk, as per chapter 98, article IV of the Dover Code of Ordinances, shall be required to be installed along the entire public street frontage of a property. Where frontage sidewalk exists but does not meet the standards of chapter 98, article IV, the sidewalk shall be re-laid to meet the standards. Sidewalk shall include barrier-free access ramping at points of intersection with street crossings and at other locations so as to afford reasonable barrier-free pedestrian movement and site access. 
b)  Private street frontage . Wherever a private road within a development is proposed, whether planned for future subdivision or not, standard City of Dover sidewalk, as per chapter 98, article IV of the Dover Code of Ordinances, shall be required to be installed on both sides of the cartway of the private road. Such sidewalk shall include barrier-free access ramping at points of intersection with street crossings and at other locations so as to afford reasonable barrier-free pedestrian movement and site access. 
c)  On-site linkages . Within all nonresidential developments and all multifamily residential developments, sidewalk at least five feet wide, constructed of concrete or good paving brick laid substantially in concrete, shall be installed to make pathways between street frontages, parking areas, building entrances, and any other site features needing pedestrian access. Such pathways shall be designed to provide reasonable travel times between these features and disincentivize taking shortcuts across areas inappropriate for pedestrians. Where such pathways must cross drive lanes, standard City of Dover crosswalk shall be installed. 
18.4  Alterations to pathway design standards . The planning commission or city planner, according to the type of plan review required by article 10 of this ordinance, may alter the minimum pathway design standards under the following circumstances in order to allow for multi-modal access: 
a)  Where vehicular traffic on adjacent roadways is of sufficient speed and volume to pose a potential danger to bicyclists and other non-motorized forms of transport using the roadway, or where pedestrian and multi-modal traffic is expected in sufficient volumes to cause conflicts on a narrower sidewalk, a ten-foot wide multi-use path made of concrete or asphalt may be required instead of standard City of Dover sidewalk along the public street frontage. 
b)  Where it is determined by evaluation of the characteristics of the nearby transportation networks including roadway classification type, the presence and type of existing pathways, and the general character of the area in terms of development, future development potential, and zoning district, a ten-foot wide multi-use path made of concrete or asphalt may be required instead of standard City of Dover sidewalk along the public street frontage. 
c)  Where an adopted plan recommends installation of multi-modal facilities for a specific site, those facilities may be required to be constructed according to the standards of the agency implementing the plan. 
d)  Where it can be shown that pathway materials alternate to those specified in this section would be more durable to multi-modal traffic, be more environmentally desirable, or be more in keeping with the overall design of the development, use of these alternate materials may be authorized. 
18.5  Waiver of pathway location requirements . The property owner or developer may request a waiver from the planning commission or city planner, according to the type of plan review required by Appendix B-Zoning, Article 10-Planning Commission, under the following circumstances in order to reduce or eliminate the requirements for pathway installation: 
a)  When the property is isolated from the existing pathway network, with no existing pathways within the immediate vicinity of the property. 
b)  When the proposed use would not generate or attract additional pedestrian, bicycle, or other non-motorized trips. 
c)  When physical characteristics of the property are such that pathway installation is impractical or impossible. 
18.6  State law requirements . Where state laws or regulations of the Delaware Department of Transportation applying to right-of-way design conflict with the provisions of this section, the state laws and regulations shall prevail. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2017-12 , adopted October 9, 2017, in effect, repealed § 18 and enacted a new § 18 as set out herein. Former § 18 pertained to sidewalk requirements and derived from Ord. of 6-13-1994; and Ord. of 9-13-1999. 
Section 19. - Building and architectural design guidelines. 
    The following guidelines shall be used in design of buildings and their architectural characteristics for the purposes of meeting the intent of appendix B, zoning, article 10, planning commission, section 2, subsection 2.27: 
(1)  Physical orientation and facade. 
(i)  The principal building facade of proposed buildings shall be oriented toward the primary street frontage, and in the same direction as the majority of existing buildings on the frontage street. Proposed buildings on corner properties shall reflect a public facade on both street frontages. 
(ii)  Consideration shall be given to the dominant architectural features of existing buildings, but do not necessarily have to mimic those styles. Large expanses of blank walls are to be avoided, and consideration shall be given to windows and entrance ways along frontage, as well as projecting elements such as eaves, cornices, canopies, projecting bays, shadow lines and overhangs. 
(2)  Architectural characteristics. 
(i)  Building proportions. Consideration shall be given to proportional attributes, including overall height-to-width ratios, of existing building facades, doors, windows, projecting canopies, and other architectural features, found in adjacent existing buildings. 
(ii)  Building mass. Facades of new buildings shall consider, but not mimic, the sense of lightness or weight of existing buildings on neighboring properties and consider similar proportions of solids (i.e., siding, blank walls, etc.) to voids (i.e., windows, door openings, etc.). 
(iii)  Materials. Proposed buildings shall incorporate durable exterior surface materials similar to and complementary with the color, texture, size, and scale of exterior materials reflected on existing buildings in the immediate vicinity. 
(iv)  Roofs. Consideration shall be given to general shape, ridge and eave heights, and material characteristics expressed in existing buildings along the subject street. 
(v)  Visible utilities . Outside HVAC equipment and visible utility connections shall be designed to minimize impact on adjacent property owners, by reducing their overall visible presence and if necessary screening them from public view. Consideration must also be given to equipment placement in proximity to loading areas and public facades of the buildings. 
(3)  Exemptions. 
(i)  Building additions. Proposed building additions which will be designed to match the architectural characteristics and exterior material treatments of the existing building to which the addition is being made shall be exempt from the requirement to submit elevation drawings or other graphic representations.

(a)  Campus Parking Plan. When a new building or building addition is made to a campus involving multiple buildings under common ownership where one or more of the uses will be generating demand for parking when the other use or uses are not in operation, the applicant shall present a campus parking plan as a part of the site development plan that includes an analysis of the parking needs based on the provisions of section 3.8 of this article. 
3.9  Adjustments to parking requirements. The planning commission or city planner, according to the type of plan review required by appendix B, zoning, article 10, planning commission, may reduce, in an amount not to exceed 50 percent, the number of parking spaces required when, in the opinion of the commission, it has been demonstrated that the use is adequately served by transportation and parking alternatives, including but not limited to: 
(a)  Site plan proposals within the downtown redevelopment target area, as described in appendix C of the Dover Code of Ordinances, may be granted a 20 percent reduction in the amount of off-street parking normally required, due to the availability of mass transit, municipal parking and existing pedestrian amenities. 
(b)  Designated off-street parking reserved for car pools, van pools, and bicycle parking facilities, in accordance with the following schedule: 
(1)  Each carpool space shall be equivalent to three standard parking spaces. 
(2)  Each vanpool space shall be equivalent to five standard parking spaces. 
(3)  Every group of five bicycle parking spaces shall be equivalent to one standard parking space. 
(c)  Employer participation in a traffic-mitigation plan approved by the Delaware Department of Transportation. 
(d)  Cash-in-lieu of parking contributions toward the capital construction or improvement of municipal parking facilities that are proposed. The cash-in-lieu of parking contribution shall be in a monetary amount equivalent to the estimated cost of construction for the number of standard surface parking spaces for which the reduction is sought. To take advantage of this option, the developer shall submit to the city engineer a cost estimate for the parking requested to be waived. The city engineer shall examine the estimate for accuracy in current prevailing costs of construction at the time of proposal and shall report to the planning commission his/her findings. 
(e)  Proposals involving superior urban design which contribute to an enhanced pedestrian environment and which include such features as pedestrian plazas and pocket-parks, pedestrian-way connections with existing sidewalk systems and community facilities, park benches and other street furniture, mass transit connections and shelters, and landscaping and shade tree plantings. 
In all areas, except the downtown redevelopment target area, the planning commission or city planner, according to the type of plan review required by appendix B, zoning, article 10, planning commission, may require the development plans to have an area of open space designated where parking could be constructed less than or equal to the number being reduced. In such cases the plan shall bear a note which explains that the petitioner, in accepting a parking reduction, agrees to construct such additional parking as is otherwise required under the provisions of this appendix, if the planning commission, after a hearing, determines that the reasons for granting said reduction no longer exist. In all such instances where the planning commission determines that the reasons for granting a reduction no longer exist, the owner of record for the subject property for which a reduction was previously granted must construct the parking required to meet the regulations of the city during the next construction season. 
3.10  Bicycle parking. Bicycle parking shall be provided for parking spaces at a rate of one bicycle parking space for every 20 parking spaces or a fraction thereof. The planning commission may waive the requirement for the bicycle parking if it is demonstrated that bicycle parking would not be appropriate for safety reasons or due to the nature of the use of the site.

1)  On an improved lot, when it can be demonstrated that retrofitting the site for loading berth(s) is impractical or impossible; 
2)  When the applicant can demonstrate that the intended use is such that no deliveries by large vehicles is expected, now or in the future; 
3)  When the applicant can demonstrate that the requirements of this ordinance are far in excess of [the] actual needs on the site; 
4)  In the downtown redevelopment target area, where on-street loading areas are provided nearby. 
In all cases, except in the downtown redevelopment target area, land for at least one standard sized loading berth meeting all requirements of this ordinance must be reserved.

ARTICLE 7. - NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND USES 

Section 1. - Nonconforming buildings and uses. 
    The following provisions shall apply to all buildings and uses existing on the effective date of this ordinance, which buildings and uses do not conform to the requirements set forth in this ordinance; to all buildings and uses that become nonconforming by reason of any subsequent amendment to this ordinance and the zoning map which is a part thereof; and to all conforming buildings housing nonconforming uses: 
1.1 Any nonconforming use, except those nonconforming uses specified in [sub]section 1.5, may be continued indefinitely, but: 
1.11 Shall not be enlarged, extended, reconstructed or placed on a different portion of the lot or parcel of land occupied by such uses on the effective date of this ordinance, nor shall any external evidence of such use such as traffic, noise, vibration, smoke, dust, odor, heat or glare be increased by any means whatsoever; or 
1.12 Shall not be changed to another nonconforming use without a special permit from the board of adjustment, and then only to a use which, in the opinion of said board, is of the same or a more restricted nature; or 
1.13 Shall not be reestablished if such use has been discontinued for any reason for a period of one year or more, or has been changed to, or replaced by, a conforming use. Intent to resume a nonconforming use shall not confer the right to do so. 
1.2 Except as provided in paragraph [subsection] 1.4 below, no building which houses a non-conforming use shall be: 
1.21 Structurally altered or enlarged; or 
1.22 Moved to another location where such use would be nonconforming; or 
1.23 Restored for other than a conforming use after damage from any cause exceeding 75 percent of the replacement cost of such building, exclusive of foundations. Any such building damage[d] to a lesser extent may be restored, but not enlarged, and the nonconforming use reinstated within one year of such damage; [however,] if the restoration of such building is not completed within the said one-year period, the nonconforming use of such building shall be deemed to have been discontinued, unless such nonconforming use is carried on without interruption in the undamaged portion of such building. 
1.3 Normal maintenance and repair, structural alteration in, and moving, reconstruction or enlargement of a building which does not house a nonconforming use, but is nonconforming as to the district regulations for lot area, lot width, front yard, side yard, rear yard, maximum height, maximum lot coverage, or minimum livable floor area per dwelling is permitted if the same does not increase the degree of, or create any new nonconformity with such regulations in such building. 
1.4 Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance and repair of any building, or the carrying out, upon the issuance of a building permit, of major structural alterations or demolitions necessary in the interest of public safety. In granting such a permit, the city planner shall state the precise reason why such alterations were deemed necessary. 
1.5 Each of the nonconforming uses specified below is deemed sufficiently objectionable, undesirable, and out of character in the district in which such use is located as to depreciate the value of other property and uses permitted in the district, and blight the proper and orderly development and general welfare of such district and the city to the point that each of such nonconforming uses shall be terminated on or before the expiration of the specified period of time after the effective date of this ordinance; which period of time is specified for the purpose of permitting the amortization of the remaining value, if any, of such use. 
1.51 In any residence zone, any nonconforming use of open land, including such uses as a parking lot, junkyard, or open storage yard for materials or equipment, may be continued for three years after the effective date of this ordinance, or after annexation of the property into the City of Dover, provided that, after the expiration of that period, such nonconforming use shall be terminated (see also article 6, section 1.12). Any "mobile home" as that term is defined in article 12 hereof, that was located within the limits of the City of Dover at the effective date of this ordinance [November 22, 1976], or that was in place on any land subsequently annexed into the City of Dover, shall constitute a nonconforming use and shall be permitted to be maintained as a nonconforming use indefinitely. However, such mobile home shall be required to connect to city sewer and water mains, if available, and such mobile home shall be subject to and shall comply with all other city codes and ordinances applicable to structures and residences. 
1.52 In any residence zone, any sign not of a type permitted, or of a permitted type, but greater than two times the maximum permitted size may be continued for one year following the effective date of this ordinance, provided that, after the expiration of that period, such nonconforming use shall be terminated. 
1.53 In any residence zone, any non-conforming use of buildings which is not permitted under the provisions of this ordinance may be continued for a period of: 
(a)  Twenty years after the effective date of this ordinance, or 
(b)  Forty years after the initial construction of the building containing such use or of any addition thereto adding 50 percent or more to the floor area occupied by such use, 
whichever is the longer period, provided that, after the expiration of that period, such nonconforming use shall be terminated. However, no such nonconforming use shall be permitted to continue for a period exceeding two years, unless such use shall be operated in conformance with performance standards established in article 5, section 8. 
1.6 Residential occupancies that meet the definition of "student home," as provided in article 12 of this ordinance, that can be proven to have been in existence as a student home use prior to the enactment of regulations governing student homes, shall be permitted to remain as legal nonconforming uses as to location and shall not be subject to the conditional use approval requirements set forth in article 10, section 2, provided that all such uses shall be made to conform with all other provisions of article 3, section 2.4, subsection (b), with regard to licensing as a student home, off-street parking requirements and number of students in residence in the student home, within six months of the effective date of the ordinance amendment establishing article 3, section 2.4, subsection (b). Documentation to prove that a student home use existed prior to the enactment of this ordinance shall be limited to executed lease agreements, City of Dover licensing data, and/or [a] sworn legal affidavit from the owner of record of the property.

ARTICLE 9. - BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT 

Section 1. - Creation, appointment and organization. 
    There shall be a board of adjustment pursuant to the provisions of chapter 3 of title 22, Municipalities, of the Delaware Code Annotated (22 Del. C. § 301 et seq.). 
Section 2. - Powers and duties. 
    The board of adjustment shall have the powers and duties as specified in Delaware Code Annotated (22 Del. C. § 301 et seq.) and as articulated below: 
2.1  Variance . The board shall have the authority to authorize variances from provisions of the zoning ordinance that are not contrary to public interest where the board determines that a literal interpretation of the zoning ordinance would result in undue hardship or exceptional practical difficulties to the applicant. In granting variances, the board shall determine that the spirit of the zoning ordinance is observed and substantial justice done. 
2.11  Area variance . A variance shall be considered an area variance if it relates to bulk standards, signage regulations, and other provisions of the zoning ordinance that address lot layout, buffers, and dimensions. In considering a request for an area variance, the board shall evaluate the following criteria and document them in their findings of fact: 
(a)  The nature of the zone in which the property lies; 
(b)  The character of the immediate vicinity and the contained uses therein; 
(c)  Whether, if the restriction upon the applicant's property were removed, such removal would seriously affect neighboring properties and uses; and 
(d)  Whether, if the restriction is not removed, the restriction would create unnecessary hardship or exceptional practical difficulty for the owner in his efforts to make normal improvements in the character of that use of the property that is a permitted use under the provisions of the zoning ordinance. 
2.12  Use variance . A variance shall be considered a use variance if it would permit a use of the subject property that would otherwise not be permitted on the subject property. In considering a request for a use variance, the board shall determine that the following criteria exist and document them in their findings of fact: 
(a)  That there are physical conditions applying to the land or building for which the variance is sought, which conditions are peculiar to such land or building, and have not resulted from any act of the applicant or any predecessor in title; and 
(b)  That the aforesaid circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of all reasonable use of such land or building and the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building, and that the variance as granted by the board is the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose; and 
(c)  That the granting of the variance under such conditions as the board may deem necessary or desirable to apply thereto will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this ordinance, will not represent a radical departure therefrom, will not be injurious to the neighborhood, will not change the character thereof and will not be otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
2.2  Appeal of administrative order, requirement, decision, or determination . The board shall have the authority to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of the zoning ordinance. Appeals to the board may be made by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the municipality affected by any decision of an administrative officer. 
(Ord. of 12-14-1992; Ord. No. 2010-18, 8-9-2010) 
Section 3. - Procedure. 
    The powers and duties of the board of adjustment shall be exercised in accordance with the following procedure: 
3.1 The board of adjustment shall not decide upon any appeal or variance without first holding a public hearing, notice of which hearing and of the substance of the appeal or application shall be given by publication in the official newspaper of the city at least ten days before the date of such hearing. In addition to such published notice, the board of adjustment shall cause notice to be given of the substance of every appeal for a variance, together with notice of the hearing thereon, by causing notices thereof to be mailed by postal card or other means at least ten days before the date of said hearing to the owners of all property abutting that held by the applicant in the immediate area (whether or not involved in such appeal) and all other owners within 200 feet, or such additional distance as the board of adjustment may deem advisable, from the exterior boundaries of the land involved in such appeal, as the names of said owners appear on the last completed assessment roll of the city. Any or all of the notices required by this subsection shall be issued by the office of the city planner on order of the board of adjustment or upon order of the chairperson of said board if the appeal is received when the board is not in session and the chairperson deems it necessary or desirable to expedite the public hearing on such appeal. Provided that due notice shall have been published as above provided and that there shall have been substantial compliance with the remaining provisions of the subsection, the failure to give notice in exact conformance herewith shall not be deemed to invalidate action taken by the board of adjustment in connection with the granting of any appeal or variance. 
3.2 If the land involved in an appeal or application lies within 500 feet of the boundary of any other incorporated municipality, the city planner shall also transmit to the municipal clerk of such other municipality a copy of the official notice of the public hearing thereon not later than the day after such notice appears in the official newspaper of the city. 
3.3 Unless work is commenced and diligently prosecuted within one year of the date of the granting of a variance, such variance shall become null and void. 
3.4 All variance applications and appeals made to the board of adjustment shall be in writing, on forms prescribed by the board. All variance requests and appeals from an order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official, board or agency of the city shall be accompanied by a fee as provided for in Appendix F-Fees and Fines. The board of adjustment may, in its discretion, return to the applicant part or all of the fee paid by him in the event that his appeal under section 2.2 Appeal of administrative order, requirement, decision, or determination hereof is partially or wholly successful. The fees filed in connection with applications under section 2.1 Variance shall not be returnable, regardless of disposition of the case by the board. 
3.5 Each variance application or appeal shall fully set forth the circumstances of the case. Every variance application or appeal shall refer to the specific provision of the ordinance involved, and shall exactly set forth, as the case may be, the interpretation that is claimed, the details of the variance that is applied for and the grounds on which it is claimed that the same should be granted. 
3.6 Every decision of the board of adjustment shall be recorded in accordance with standard forms adopted by the board, and shall fully set forth the circumstances of the case and shall contain a full record of the findings on which the decision is based. Every decision of the board shall be filed by case number, together with all documents pertaining thereto. 
3.7 All the provisions of this ordinance relating to the board of adjustment shall be strictly construed. The board, as a body of limited jurisdiction, shall act in full conformity with all provisions of law and of this ordinance and in strict compliance with all limitations contained therein; provided, however, that if the procedural requirements set forth in this section have been substantially observed, no applicant or appellant shall be deprived of the right of application or appeal. 
3.8 Whenever the board of adjustment denies an application for variance, such application for variance, or an application on the same property which is substantially similar, shall not be accepted for reconsideration by the board of adjustment sooner than one year from the date of denial.
