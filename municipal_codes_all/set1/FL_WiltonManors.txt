PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Wilton Manors, Florida of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the city's 1964 Code, as supplemented through September 24, 1985, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1964 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinances included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code are conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. Tables listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code are included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-1 and the second section of Chapter 3 is 3-2. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-1 and 4-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-1.1, 4-1.2 and 4-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 5 and 6, it will be designated as Chapter 5.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and Terry Pine and Linda Davis, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

    The publisher is most grateful to Sharon Birken, City Clerk, Wallace Payne, City Manager and George Richardson, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

In many instances corrections of obvious misspelled words and typographical errors have been made without notation. The catchlines of the various sections have been either added or enlarged to indicate the full content of the sections. Style and capitalization have been made uniform. Words added for clarification have been added in brackets [ ].

(Ord. No. 870, § 2, 5-10-05)

Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the code inspector shall request a hearing before the code enforcement special magistrate. 
(Ord. No. 870, § 2, 5-10-05) 
Sec. 2-73. - Hearing-Request. 
(a)  The code enforcement special magistrate, through his or her clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing upon request of the inspector. Written notice of such hearing shall be hand delivered or mailed as provided in section 2-74 to the violator. Notice may additionally be served by publication or posting as provided in section 2-74. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code inspector, the case may be presented to the code enforcement special magistrate even if the violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(b)  If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator, but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code inspector, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall request a hearing before the code enforcement special magistrate. The code enforcement special magistrate, through his or her clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing and shall provide notice to the violator as provided in section 2-74. The case may be presented to the code enforcement special magistrate even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the special magistrate hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(c)  If the code inspector has reason to believe a violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and he may immediately notify the code enforcement special magistrate and request a hearing.

(4)  File a notice with the city's code enforcement official of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five (5) days after the date of the transfer. 
A failure to make the disclosures described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(Ord. No. 870, § 2, 5-10-05)

(2)  Hand delivery by the sheriff or other law enforcement officer, code inspector, or other person designated by the local governing body; 
(3)  Leaving the notice at the violator's usual place of residence with any person residing therein who is above fifteen (15) years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice; or 
(4)  In the case of commercial premises, leaving the notice with the manager or other person in charge. 
(b)  In addition to providing notice as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, at the option of the code enforcement board, notice may also be served by publication or posting as follows: 
(1)  Such notice shall be published once during each week for four (4) consecutive weeks (four (4) publications being sufficient) in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the code enforcement board is located. The newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under ch. 50, F.S., for legal and official advertisements. Proof of publication shall be made as provided in F.S. §§ 50.041 and 50.051. 
(2)  In lieu of publication as described in subsection (b)(1), such notice may be posted at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing, or prior to any deadline contained in the notice in at least two (2) locations, one (1) of which shall be the property upon which the violations alleged to exist, and the other of which shall be the primary municipal government office. Proof of posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(3)  Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt to provide notice by hand delivery or by mail as required under subsection (a). 
(c)  Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice as provided in subsection (a), together with proof of publication or posting as provided in subsection (b), shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this section have been met without regard as to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice. 
(Ord. No. 870, § 2, 5-10-05) 
Sec. 2-75. - Fine for failure to comply with order. 
(a)  The code enforcement special magistrate, upon notification by the inspector that a previous order of the code enforcement special magistrate has not been complied with by the set time or, upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in the amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the code enforcement special magistrate for compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each date the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in F.S. § 162.06(4), as amended from time to time (if the code enforcement officer has reason to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety or welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible), the code enforcement special magistrate shall notify the local governing body, which may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of repairs, along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the local governing body to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the local governing body for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made, as provided in this section, a hearing shall not be necessary for the issuance of an order imposing the fine. 
(b)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for a first violation and shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for a repeat violation and, in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to subsection (a) above. However, if the code enforcement special magistrate finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per violation. 
    In formulating its order, the code enforcement special magistrate should be consistent in the imposition of fines and shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The gravity of the violation; 
(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
(3)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. The city commission may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this section; if however, the subject violation fails to pay said reduced fine within a period of sixty (60) days from the day the order is rendered deciding said fine, then the original fine shall be reinstated. If the violator makes arrangements through the city manager to pay said reduced fine in monthly payments and fails to timely make any one (1) of the monthly payments, then the original fine, less payments made, shall be automatically reinstated. 
(c)  Fines are to be paid to the city finance department. 
(d)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the code enforcement special magistrate shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The gravity of the violation; 
(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
(3)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(e)  A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the local governing body and the local governing body may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section. 
(Ord. No. 870, § 2, 5-10-05; Ord. No. 918, § 2, 5-8-07) 
Sec. 2-76. - Fine as a lien; superiority of lien. 
(a)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a fine plus repair costs, may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Effective April 1, 2010, code enforcement liens shall remain liens, coequal with the liens of all state, county, district, and municipal taxes, superior in dignity to all other liens, titles, encumbrances and claims until paid. The priority of the code enforcement liens versus mortgages, liens and encumbrances in existence prior to April 1, 2010, shall be determined as of the date of recording of the lien. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order shall be enforceable in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriff's of this state, including execution and levy against the personal property of the violator, but such order shall not be deemed otherwise to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this division shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. 
(b)  After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the code enforcement special magistrate may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on the lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this division may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under Section 4, Article X of the state constitution.

(d)  After issuing a citation to an alleged violator, a code enforcement officer shall deposit the original citation and one (1) copy of the citation with the county court. 
(e)  A person who receives a citation from a code enforcement officer for the violation of any code or ordinance has committed a civil infraction and shall be subject to a fine in accordance with the following schedule:

(c)  Failure of a violator to appeal the decision of the code inspector within this time period shall constitute a waiver of the violator's right to an administrative hearing. A waiver of the right to administrative hearing shall be deemed an admission of the violation, and penalties may be imposed accordingly. 
(Ord. No. 870, § 2, 5-10-05) 
Sec. 2-80. - Same-Collection and recovery of civil penalties. 
(a)  The city manager shall provide by administrative order the appropriate guidelines and procedures for the administration, collection, recordkeeping, reporting, and accountability of fines assessed under this article. The finance department of the city is authorized to collect such fines. 
(b)  The city may institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to compel payment of civil penalties. 
(c)  If the hearing officer finds that a violation exists and assesses the fine, or if a violator does not contest a citation as provided under this article, and the violator fails to pay the applicable fine, the hearing officer may enter an order imposing the fines previously set. A certified copy of an order imposing a civil penalty may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the real and personal property of the violator. The order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriff of this state, including levy against the personnel property, but shall not be deemed to a court judgment, except for enforcement purposes. After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the city may foreclose or otherwise execute on the lien.

(u)  Bidding preference for local vendors. 
(1)  Purpose and findings. The city annually spends significant dollars on purchasing personal property, materials and services, and in constructing improvements to real property or existing structures. The dollars used in making those purchases are derived, in part, from taxes, fees and utility revenues paid by businesses located within the corporate city limits, and the city commission has determined that funds generated in the community should, to the extent possible, be placed back into the local economy. Therefore, the city commission has determined that it is in the best interest of the city to give a preference to local businesses in making such purchases as provided for herein. 
(2)  Definitions. 
    General services means support services performed by an independent contractor requiring specialized knowledge, experience, or expertise that includes, but is not limited to, pest control, janitorial, laundry, catering, security, lawn maintenance, and maintenance of equipment. 
    Goods includes, but is not limited to, supplies, equipment, materials and printed matter. 
    Local business means the vendor has a valid occupational license issued by the county or another municipality located within the county at least one (1) year prior to bid or proposal opening to do business and that authorizes the business to provide the goods, services or construction to be purchased and a physical business address located within the limits of the county, in an area zoned for the conduct of such business, from which the vendor operates or performs business on a day-to-day basis that is a substantial component of the goods or services being offered to the county or another municipality located in the county. Post Office boxes are not verifiable and shall not be used for the purpose of establishing said physical address. In order to be eligible for local preference, the vendor must provide a copy of the occupational license(s) for the covered period prior to recommendation for award. 
(3)  Local preference; procedure. Except where otherwise provided by federal or state law or other funding source restrictions, purchases of goods, general services, or professional services under the procurement code may give preference to local businesses in the following manner: 
a.  Under a competitive bid solicitation, when a responsive, responsible non-local business submits the lowest price bid, and the bid submitted by one (1) or more responsive, responsible local businesses is within two (2) percent of the price submitted by the non-local business, then that non-local business and each of the aforementioned responsive, responsible local businesses shall have the opportunity to submit, within five (5) working days of notice of intent to award, a best and final bid equal to or lower than the amount of the low bid previously submitted by the non-local business. Contract award shall be made to the responsive, responsible business submitting the lowest best and final bid. In the case of a tie in the best and final bid between a local business and a non-local business, contract award shall be made to the local business. 
b.  For all other competitive solicitations in which objective factors used to evaluate the responses from vendors are assigned point totals, if, upon the completion of final rankings (technical and price combined, if applicable) by the selection committee, a non-local business is the highest ranked proposer and the ranking of a local proposer is within five (5) percent of the ranking obtained by the non-local proposer, the highest ranked local proposer shall have the opportunity to proceed to negotiations with the city. 
c.  If a tie occurs between two (2) or more local businesses, then the tie may be broken using the tie breaker criteria in the procurement code. 
(4)  Waiver. The application of local preference to a particular purchase, contract, or category of contracts for which the city commission of the City of Wilton Manors is the awarding authority may be waived upon written recommendation of the city manager and approval of the city commission. The application of local preference to a particular purchase, contract, or category of contracts below the award authority of the city commission may be waived upon written recommendation of the director of purchasing and approval of the city manager. 
(5)  Other preferences. The preferences established herein in no way prohibit the right of the city commission to compare quality of materials proposed for purchase and compare qualifications, character, responsibility and fitness of all persons, firms, or corporations submitting bids or proposals. Further, the preferences established herein in no way prohibit the right of the city commission from giving any other preference permitted by law instead of the preference authorized herein. 
(6)  Exemption of certain contracts. Co-operative purchases shall be exempt unless all participants in the co-operative purchase agree to apply this local preference ordinance. In addition, particular categories of contracts may be exempted from application of local preference, upon determination by the city commission that such exemption is in the best interests of the city.

h.  Upon a majority vote, the city commission may waive compliance of this section under the following circumstances: 
1.  Where only one (1) solicitation response is received; 
2.  Where more than one (1) solicitation response is received, but the solicitation demonstrates that none of the proposed solicitations can comply with the requirements of this section; or 
3.  Where the cost of the bid, as submitted by the lowest responsive bidder which complies with the requirements of this section, would be at least five (5) percent greater than the lowest responsive bid submitted by the bidder which does not comply with the requirements of this section but would otherwise have been responsive if compliance with this section would not have been listed as a requirement in the bid specifications.

The assessable cost for each property owner for property located in the assessable area shall then be added together to arrive at the total assessment. 
(c)  Annual determination of cost for a service.

Thereafter, if the decision is to levy the special assessments, the city shall equalize or adjust such assessments where justice and right so dictate, and shall approve and confirm the assessment roll by resolution (the "assessment resolution"). When so equalized and approved, a final assessment roll shall be filed in the office of the city clerk of the city, and such assessments shall stand confirmed and remain legal, valid and binding first liens upon the property against which such assessments are made until paid. The annual assessment amount for a service shall be determined by city in accordance with section 2-278(c) shall be filed in the office of the city clerk of the city, and such assessments shall stand confirmed and remain legal, valid and binding first liens upon the property against which such assessments are made until paid.

(e)  Upon completion of a project or termination of a service, any excess in the special assessment as originally made, approved and confirmed over the actual cost of the improvement to be paid by such special assessment, shall be credited proportionately against each special assessment against each parcel in the manner set forth in the assessment resolution, or used for any lawful purpose.

(3)  Statements shall be filed not later than 5:00 p.m. on the date the statement is due.

The city clerk shall provide for a procedure by which a lobbyist who fails to timely file a statement shall be notified and assessed fines. The procedure shall provide for the following: 
a.  Upon determining that the statement is late, the person designated to review the timeliness of statements shall immediately notify the lobbyist as to the failure to timely file the statement and that a fine is being assessed for each late day.

b.  Upon receipt of the statement, the person designated to review the timeliness of statements shall determine the amount of the fine due based upon the earliest of the following: 
1.  When a statement is actually received. 
2.  When the statement is postmarked. 
3.  When the certificate of mailing is dated. 
4.  When the statement from an established courier company is dated. 
c.  Such fine shall be paid within twenty (20) days after receipt of the notice of payment due, unless appeal is made to the city commission. 
d.  A fine shall not be assessed against a lobbyist the first time any statement for which the lobbyist is responsible is not timely filed. However, to receive the one-time fine waiver, all statements for which the lobbyist is responsible must be filed within twenty (20) days after receipt of notice that any statements have not been timely filed. A fine shall be assessed for any subsequent late-filed statement. 
e.  Any lobbyist may appeal or dispute a fine, based upon unusual circumstances surrounding the failure to file on the designated due date, and may request and shall be entitled to a hearing before the city commission, which shall have the authority to waive the fine in whole or in part for good cause shown. Any such request shall be made within twenty (20) days after receipt of the notice of payment due.

(a)  A franchise authorizes use of city streets for installing cables, wires, lines, optical fiber, underground conduit, ducts, conductors, amplifiers, vaults, and other facilities as necessary and pertinent to operate a cable system within a specified area of the city, but does not expressly or implicitly authorize the franchisee to provide service to, or install, cables, wires, lines, underground conduit, or any other equipment or facilities upon private property without owner consent (except for use of compatible easements pursuant to Section 621 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 541(a) (2)), or to use publicly or privately owned conduits without a separate agreement with the owners. 
(b)  A franchise is nonexclusive, and will not expressly or implicitly preclude the issuance of other franchises to operate cable systems within the city, or affect the city's right to authorize use of city streets to other persons to operate cable systems or for other purposes as it determines appropriate. 
(c)  Once a franchise agreement has been accepted and executed by the city and a franchisee, such franchise agreement shall constitute a contract between the franchisee and the city, and the terms, conditions and provisions of such franchise agreement, together with this chapter and all other duly enacted and applicable laws, shall define the rights and obligations of the franchisee and the city relating to the franchise.

Sec. 5.5-57. - Interpretation of franchise terms.

Sec. 5.5-59. - Grant of franchise. 
(a)  The city may grant a franchise for a period not to exceed ten (10) years to serve all or a specified area of the city. 
(b)  The city may make the grant of a franchise conditioned upon the completion of construction within a reasonably prescribed time or upon the performance of other specific obligations which are to be set forth in the franchise agreement, specifying that failure to comply with the condition will cause the franchise to become null and void upon an affirmative vote of the city commission and provided further [sic]. 
(c)  In evaluating an application for a franchise, the city may consider, among other things, the following factors: The applicant's technical, financial, and legal qualifications to construct and operate the proposed system; the adequacy of the proposed construction arrangements, facilities, equipment, and services based on the public convenience, safety and welfare; the applicant's experience in constructing and operating cable systems and providing cable service in other communities, if any; the ability of city streets to accommodate the proposed system; the potential disruption to users of city streets and any resultant inconvenience to the public; and whether the proposal will meet reasonably anticipated community needs and serve the public interest. Evaluation by the city shall not be based on the content of the programming the applicant proposes to provide. 
(d)  The city may hold a public hearing to consider an application or applications. The applicant(s) shall be notified of the hearing and shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Based upon the application(s), the testimony presented at the public hearing, any recommendations of the city manager or staff, and any other information relevant to the application(s), the city shall decide by resolution whether to grant or deny a franchise application(s) and decide the terms and conditions of any franchise(s) granted. Upon the grant of a franchise, the franchise agreement shall become an integral part of such franchise, and the grantee shall be bound by the representations made therein. 
(e)  If the city grants a franchise application, the city and the grantee shall agree on the terms of a franchise agreement within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the city resolution making the grant. This period may be extended for good cause by the city. If agreement is not reached with the city within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the city resolution making the grant, or if the period is not extended by the city, the franchise grant will be null and void upon an affirmative vote of the city commission. 
(f)  Following at least ten (10) days' prior notice to the grantee and the public, the city commission may hold a public hearing at which it will receive comment on the proposed franchise agreement. 
(g)  After complying with the above requirements, the city commission shall approve or disapprove the proposed franchise agreement by resolution, or may direct that it be subject to further negotiation. 
(h)  The grant of an initial franchise, a renewed franchise, an application to modify a franchise agreement, or an application to transfer a franchise may be subject to a processing fee in an amount not to exceed the reasonable and justifiable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the city in considering the application, less the amount of the filing fee set pursuant to subsection 5.5-58(i) but not including any payments for consultants. Within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the resolution approving or denying the franchise agreement or modification or transfer thereof by the city commission, the city shall notify the grantee of the amount of any processing fee and its method of calculation. If the processing fee is not paid to the city within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of the city commission resolution approving or denying the franchise agreement or a modification or transfer thereof, any approval granted by such resolution will be null and void upon an affirmative vote of city commission and provided further written notice is given to the franchisee in advance of the vote.

In cases where the franchisee intends planned repairs or maintenance with interruption of service in excess of twenty-four (24) hours, the franchisee shall give the city reasonable advance notice to the city. 
(m)  If the franchisee has computer capability to do so, a franchisee shall maintain a complete record of all service complaints received, whether written, verbal, or telephonic, and action taken.

Such records shall be subject to the provisions of this article. Such records shall be retained for at least one (1) year after their recordation.

(5)  Subscribers shall not be charged a late fee or otherwise penalized for any failure by the franchisee, its employees, or contractors, including failure to timely or correctly bill the subscriber, or failure to properly credit the subscriber for a payment timely made. 
(6)  In the event of a billing dispute, the franchisee shall waive a late fee during the period until a final resolution of the dispute is agreed upon between the franchisee and the city. 
(7)  The franchisee shall not charge subscribers an additional fee for paying bills by either telephone or on-line unless and until it provides the city with an analysis of the franchisee's cost of processing such payments and the additional fee is approved by the city commission at a public hearing. If an additional fee is approved by the city commission, the franchisee shall provide at least sixty (60) days written notice of adoption of the fee to all Subscribers prior to implementing the fee. 
(p)  Alteration of service. A franchisee may not substantially alter the service being provided to a subscriber (including by retiering, restructuring a tier or otherwise) without the express permission of such subscriber, unless it complies with this subsection or other applicable law. 
(1)  If a franchisee wishes to alter the service being provided to a subscriber (including by retiering, restructuring a tier or otherwise) in such a way that the subscriber will no longer be able to obtain the same package of services (exclusive of programming additions or deletions affecting no more than five (5) channels), then the franchisee shall provide the subscriber with thirty (30) days' notice of such alteration, explain the substance and full effect of the alteration, and provide the subscriber the right within the thirty-day period following notice to opt to change the service provided or to cancel services without change.

(d)  In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee, the city may revoke the franchise, following a public hearing before the city commission, by serving notice upon the franchisee and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise will be revoked and will terminate thirty (30) calendar days after serving such notice, unless the city has approved the transfer of the franchise to the successful bidder and the successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement and this article. 
(e)  If the city revokes a franchise, or if for any other reason a franchisee abandons, terminates or fails to operate or maintain service to its subscribers, the following procedures and rights are effective: 
(1)  The city may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the city may have the removal done at the former franchisee's and/or surety's expense. 
(2)  The city, by resolution of the city commission, may acquire ownership, or effect a transfer, of the cable system at fair market value. 
(3)  If a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee, the city may sell, assign or transfer all or part of the assets of the system. 
(f)  Where the city has issued a franchise specifically conditioned in the franchise agreement upon the completion of construction, system upgrade or other specific obligation by a specified date, failure of the franchisee to complete such construction or upgrade, or to comply with such other specific obligation as required, may result in forfeiture of the franchise upon affirmative vote of the city commission at a public meeting to which the franchisee was notified in writing, unless the city, at its discretion and for good cause demonstrated by the franchisee, grants an extension of time. 
(g)  No adverse action against a franchisee may be taken by the city pursuant to this section except after a noticed public hearing at which the franchisee is given an opportunity to participate. 
(Ord. No. 748, § 1, 1-25-96; Ord. No. 848, 10-14-03) 
Sec. 5.5-76. - Continuity of service mandatory. 
(a)  It is the right of all subscribers to receive all available services from the franchisee as long as their financial and other obligations to the franchisee are satisfied. 
(b)  In the event of a termination or transfer of a franchise for whatever reason, the franchisee shall ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances. The franchisee shall cooperate with the city to operate the system for a temporary period following termination or transfer as necessary to maintain continuity of service to all subscribers. The temporary period will not exceed six (6) months without the franchisee's written consent. During such period, the cable system shall be operated under such terms and conditions as the city and the franchisee may agree, or such other terms and conditions that will continue, to the extent possible, the same level of service to subscribers and that will provide reasonable compensation to the cable operator. 
(c)  In the event a franchisee fails to operate the system for seven (7) consecutive days without prior approval of the city or without just cause, the city may, at its option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time as the franchisee restores service under conditions acceptable to the city or until a permanent operator is selected. If the city is required to fulfill this obligation for the franchisee, the franchisee shall reimburse the city for all costs or damages resulting from the franchisee's failure to perform that are in excess of the revenues from the system received by the city. Additionally, the franchisee will cooperate with the city to allow city employees and/or city agents free access to the franchisees' facilities and premises for purposes of continuing system operation. 
(Ord. No. 748, § 1, 1-25-96) 
Sec. 5.5-77. - Rates. 
(a)  At such time as federal and state law permit rate regulation, the city reserves all rights to implement and impose such regulation, and may do so by amendment to this article, by separate ordinance, by amendment to a franchise agreement, or in any other lawful manner. 
(b)  Nothing in this article shall prohibit the city from regulating rates for cable services to the full extent permitted by law. 
(Ord. No. 748, § 1, 1-25-96) 
Sec. 5.5-78. - Performance evaluation. 
    The city may conduct periodic performance evaluations of a franchisee as the city determines is necessary. A franchisee shall cooperate with these evaluations reasonably and in good faith. If the city implements a survey of cable subscribers in connection with a performance evaluation, the city may require a franchisee to distribute the city's questionnaire to its subscribers at the city's expense. Upon request and upon reimbursement of the city's copying costs, the franchisee may receive copies of all responses. 
(Ord. No. 748, § 1, 1-25-96) 
Sec. 5.5-79. - Administration. 
(a)  The city manager, either directly or through a duly appointed designee, shall have the responsibility for overseeing the day-to-day administration of this article and franchise agreements. The city manager shall be empowered to take all administrative actions on behalf of the city, except for those actions specified in this article that are reserved to the city commission. The city manager may recommend that the commission take certain actions with respect to the franchise. The city manager shall keep the commission apprised of developments in cable and provide the commission with assistance, advice and recommendations as appropriate. 
(b)  The city commission shall have the sole authority, subject to all applicable laws, to regulate rates for cable services, grant franchises, authorize the entering into of franchise agreements, modify franchise agreements, renew or deny renewal of franchises, revoke franchises, and authorize the transfer of a franchise. 
(Ord. No. 748, § 1, 1-25-96; Ord. No. 848, 10-14-03) 
Sec. 5.5-80. - Force majeure. 
    In the event a franchisee's performance of or compliance with any of the provisions of this article or the franchisee's franchise agreement is prevented by a cause or event not within the franchisee's control, such inability to perform or comply shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof; provided, however, that the franchisee uses all practicable means to expeditiously cure or correct any such inability to perform or comply. For purposes of this article and any franchise agreement granted or renewed hereunder, causes or events not within a franchisee's control shall include, without limitation, acts of God, floods, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, fires and other natural disasters, acts of public enemies, riots or civil disturbances, sabotage, strikes and restraints imposed by order of a governmental agency or court (unless such order is procured at franchisee's behest). Causes or events within the franchisee's control, and thus not falling within this section, shall include, without limitation, the franchisee's financial inability to perform or comply, economic hardship, and misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance by any of the franchisee's directors, officers, employees, contractors or agents. 
(Ord. No. 748, § 1, 1-25-96) 
Sec. 5.5-81. - Applicability. 
    This article shall be applicable to all cable franchises granted or renewed after January l, 1996 (the effective date hereof). 
(Ord. No. 748, § 1, 1-25-96) 
Sec. 5.5-82. - Municipal cable system ownership authorized. 
(a)  To the full extent permitted by law, the city may acquire, construct, own, and/or operate a cable system. 
(b)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit in any way the ability or authority of the city to acquire, construct, own, and/or operate a cable system to the full extent permitted by law. 
(Ord. No. 748, § 1, 1-25-96) 
Sec. 5.5-83. - Reservation of rights. 
(a)  The city reserves the right to amend this article as it shall find necessary in the lawful exercise of its police powers and shall notify the franchisee in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of any public hearing to consider any amendment to this article and shall provide the franchisee with an opportunity to be heard at such public hearing. 
(b)  Any proposed additional regulations shall be provided to all franchisees at least thirty (30) days in advance and, once adopted by the city commission, shall be incorporated into this article and complied with by all franchisees within thirty (30) days of the date of adoption of such additional regulations. 
(c)  The city reserves the right to exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire the property of the franchisee's cable system. 
(d)  The city shall, at all times, have the right, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, to examine and copy a franchisee's records and to inspect a franchisee's facilities to the extent needed to monitor a franchisee's compliance with, and performance under, this article and the franchisee's franchise agreement.

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Sections 2-5 of Ord. No. 764, adopted June 24, 1997, amended the Code by adding a new Ch. 5.6. For purposes of classification, such new provisions were codified herein as Art. III, §§ 5.5-101-5.5-111 at the discretion of the editor. 

Sec. 5.5-101. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this article, the following terms, phrases, words, and abbreviations shall have the meanings given herein, unless otherwise expressly stated. The words "shall" and "will" are mandatory, and "may" is permissive. Unless otherwise expressly stated, words not defined in this article shall be given the meaning set forth in Title 47 of the United States Code, and, if not defined therein, their common and ordinary meaning. References to governmental entities (whether persons or entities) refer to those entities or their successors in authority. If specific provisions of law referred to herein are renumbered, then the reference shall be read to refer to the renumbered provision. References to laws, ordinances or regulations shall be interpreted broadly to cover government actions, however nominated, and include laws, ordinances and regulations now in force or hereinafter enacted or amended. 
    Affiliate means a person that, directly or indirectly, owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common ownership or control with, another person. 
    Annual occupancy fee means an annual charge against the operator of communications facilities that are excused from paying the full franchise fee required under this article and the owner of a private communications system. The fee recovers an apportioned share of the costs to the city for maintaining those portions of the public rights-of-way used by the operator of a communications facility and the owner of a private communications system. 
    Communications facility means and refers to a telecommunications facility, an open video system, or a private communications system, but does not include a franchised cable system to the extent the same is used to provide cable service. 
    Construction, operation or repair, and similar formulations of that term, means the named actions interpreted broadly, encompassing, among other things, installation, extension, maintenance, replacement of components, relocation, undergrounding, grading, site preparation, adjusting, testing, make-ready, and excavation. 
    FCC means the Federal Communications Commission or its designee. 
    Franchise means and refers to the authorization granted by the city to a properly licensed operator of a telecommunications facility or open video system, giving the operator the nonexclusive right to use public rights-of-way in the city to provide, through physical facilities located therein, telecommunication services or such other service as may be specified in the franchise itself within a franchise area. Any such authorization, in whatever form granted, shall not mean or include: 
(1)  Any other permit or authorization required for the privilege of transacting and carrying on a business within the city required by the ordinances and laws of the city; 
(2)  Any permit, agreement or authorization required in connection with operations on public streets or property, including, without limitation, permits and agreements for placing devices on or in poles, conduits or other structures, whether owned by the city or a private entity, or for excavating or performing other work in or along public rights-of-way. 
    Franchise agreement means a contract entered into in accordance with the provisions of this article between the city and a franchisee that sets forth, subject to this article, the terms and conditions under which a franchise will be exercised. 
    Franchise area means the area of the city that a franchisee is authorized to serve by its franchise agreement. 
    Franchisee means and refers to a person holding a franchise issued under this article, or a franchise issued prior to this article, subject to the provisions of section 5.5-107 hereof. 
    Gross revenues means any and all revenue, of any kind, nature, or form. 
    License means and refers to the legal authorization, terminable at will, to use a particular, discrete and limited portion of the public rights-of-way. 
    Open video system or OVS means and refers to a facility consisting of a set of transmission paths and associated signal generation, reception and control equipment that is designed to provide cable service, which includes video programming, which is provided to multiple subscribers within a community, and which the Federal Communications Commission or its successor has certified as compliant with Part 76 of the Rules of the Federal Communications Commission, 47 C.F.R., Part 76, as amended from time to time. 
    Operator, when used with reference to a system, means and refers to a person who: 
(1)  Provides service over a communications facility and directly, or through one (1) or more affiliates, owns a significant interest in such facility; or 
(2)  Otherwise controls or is responsible for, through any arrangement, the management and operation of such a facility. 
A person that leases a communications facility or a specific portion of a communications facility to provide telecommunications services shall be treated as an telecommunications facility operator for purposes of this article. 
    Person means and includes any individual, corporation, partnership, association, joint stock company, trust, or any other legal entity, but not the city. 
    Private communications system means a facility placed in whole or in part in the public right-of-way for the provision of communications in connection with a person's business, but not encompassing in any respect the provision of telecommunications services. 
    Private communications system owner means a person that owns or leases a private communications facility. 
    Public rights-of-way means the surface, the area above, and the area below the surface of any public street, highway, lane, path, alley, sidewalk, boulevard, drive, bridge, tunnel, parkway, waterway, public easement, or similar property in which the city now or hereafter holds any property interest, which, consistent with the purposes for which it was dedicated, may be used for the purpose of constructing, operating and repairing a communications facility. Public rights-of-way do not include buildings, parks, or other property owned or leased by the city. No reference herein, or in any franchise agreement, to a public right-of-way shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the city that its interest or other right to control the use of such property is sufficient to permit its use for such purposes; and a franchisee shall be deemed to gain only those rights to use as are properly in the city and as the city may have the undisputed right and power to give. 
    Reseller means and refers to any person that provides telecommunications service over a communications facility for which a separate charge is made, where that person does not own or lease the underlying communications facility used for the transmission. 
    Telecommunications facility means a facility that is used to provide one (1) or more telecommunications services, any portion of which occupies public rights-of-way. The term "telecommunications facility" includes radio transmitting towers, other supporting structures, and associated facilities used to transmit telecommunications signals. An open video system is not a telecommunications facility to the extent that it provides only video services; a cable system is not a telecommunications facility to the extent it provides only cable service. 
    Telecommunications services means the transmission for hire of information in electronic or optical form, including, but not limited to, voice, video, or data, whether or not the transmission medium is owned by the provider itself. Telecommunications service includes telephone service but does not include over-the-air broadcasts to the public-at-large from facilities licensed by the Federal Communications Commission or any successor thereto, or cable services franchised pursuant to article II of this chapter. 
    Transfer means any transaction in which: 
(1)  All or a portion of the communications facility is sold or assigned (except a sale or assignment that results in removal of a particular portion of the facility from the public rights-of-way); 
(2)  There is any change, acquisition, or direct or indirect transfer of control of the franchisee or licensee; or 
(3)  The rights and/or obligations held by the franchisee or licensee under the franchise or license are transferred, sold, assigned, or leased, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, to another party. 
In succeeding provisions of this article, all these activities are referred to as franchise transfers. 
(Ord. No. 764, § 2, 6-24-97) 
Sec. 5.5-102. - Franchise. 
(a)  Required. An operator of a telecommunications facility must obtain a franchise prior to constructing a telecommunications facility or providing telecommunications services; an operator of an open video system must obtain a franchise prior to constructing an open video system or providing service via an open video system. In addition, every private communications system owner must obtain a license. So long as it pays the compensation required, a reseller may use others' facilities to conduct business in the right-of-way without obtaining a written franchise or license, so long as it does not own or lease facilities in the right-of-way and is not involved in construction or repair of facilities in the right-of-way. The fact that a particular communications facility may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise, license or other authorization for those other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, an operator of a telecommunications facility must obtain a separate franchise if it wishes to provide cable service, even if it uses the same facilities or shares facilities that are used to provide telecommunications services. No franchise shall become effective without the franchisee entering into a franchise agreement with the city. 
(b)  Purpose and characteristics. The purpose of requiring authorizations by service is to ensure as far as possible and appropriate that persons providing similar services are treated similarly, considering differences in circumstances, and to comply with requirements of federal law which may require the city to separate its authority over cable systems from its authority over other providers of telecommunications services. The revocation of a franchise for one particular type of system in and of itself will not affect the authority of a franchise holder to continue to operate another type of system for which it holds another franchise. No franchise shall be exclusive and competition shall be encouraged. The issuance of a franchise shall not affect the city's right to itself construct, operate, or repair any communications facility, with or without a franchise. 
(c)  Exceptions. A franchise requirement may be waived for a telecommunications facility or an open video system that is not designed to provide service in the city, and that does not provide service in the city, or a facility, such as an antenna or pole top attachments, where the use of the right-of-way is de minimis. For such facilities, the city may issue a license. Every license issued, including a license for a private communications system, shall require the licensee to obtain a franchise if it is determined that the license is being used in a manner that creates a competitive advantage for that operator or otherwise unduly discriminates in favor of such operator. In any case, the license must provide that if limitations of the license are violated, the licensee must pay the maximum franchise fee required by sections 5.5-109 through 5.5-111 of this article and otherwise bring itself into compliance with this article. 
(d)  Nature of grant. Neither a franchise nor a license shall convey title, equitable or legal, in the rights-of-way. The right is only the personal right to occupy rights-of-way, for the purposes and for the period stated in the franchise or license; the license or franchise may not be subdivided or subleased. 
(Ord. No. 764, § 2, 6-24-97) 
Sec. 5.5-103. - Compensation. 
(a)  Required. Every operator of a telecommunications facility, every operator of an open video system, every private communications owner, and every reseller must pay fees for use of the rights-of-way as provided in this section and the specific compensation provisions of sections 5.5-109 through 5.5-111. This article establishes a two-part fee structure. An annual occupancy fee is intended to recover ongoing right-of-way costs to the city caused by burdens users place upon the right-of-way. A franchise fee is intended to reflect the value of the right-of-way. To the extent that state law validly limits the amount a particular operator, owner or reseller can be required to pay to use the rights-of-way, such operator, owner or reseller shall pay the maximum amount permitted under state law, for the period such state law limit remains in lawful effect. In all other cases, operators of telecommunications facilities, open video systems and private communications facilities must pay the greater of the annual occupancy fee or the franchise fee required by this article and sections 5.5-109 through 5.5-111, unless a franchise or license provides otherwise. The franchise fee applies without regard to whether the operator, owner or reseller is a franchisee, licensee or uses the rights-of-way pursuant to some other authorization. The franchise fee shall be based on gross revenues, except as provided in subsection (c). 
(b)  Establishment of fees. The city may, unless otherwise negotiated and set forth in a franchise or license, fix from time-to-time by resolution the annual occupancy fee, and the market value fee contemplated by subsection (c)(2), each of which shall be charged on a per-linear-foot basis for communications facilities in the public rights-of-way for each major geographic subdivision of the city. The city may from time to time issue exemptions from an obligation to pay an annual occupancy fee where levying the fee would result in a double payment for the same facility. 
(c)  Exceptions. The franchise fees required under sections 5.5-109 and 5.5-110 need not be paid if: 
(1)  State law or charter requires otherwise, or during any transition period for a current franchise holder. In cases subject to this exception, the highest permissible fee shall be paid. 
(2)  In the case of a telecommunications facility or open video system that is not designed to provide service in the city, and that does not provide service in the city, or where a particular facility makes de minimis use of public rights-of-way, and is licensed pursuant to subsection 5.5-102(c). De minimus use of the rights-of-way shall include, but shall not be limited to, pole top attachments. The city shall establish a fee in lieu of the fees specified in sections 5.5-109 and 5.5-110 that recovers an amount equivalent to the fair market value of the property used in the city and reserves the right to charge additional fees as contemplated by subsection (e). 
(d)  Application to persons that provide different types of services. The fact that a fee is paid on one type of service provided over a communications facility does not excuse an operator from its duty to pay fees on other types of services provided over that facility. As an example, and not as a limitation of the foregoing, the operator of a communications facility must pay a cable franchise fee to the extent it provides cable services to subscribers via a cable system, in addition to the fees required hereunder. 
(e)  General rules for payment of fees. 
(1)  Unless otherwise specified in state law, a franchise agreement, or a license, the fees required under this article shall be paid to the city quarterly in a single payment made not later than forty-five (45) calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter. 
(2)  Unless a franchise agreement or license provides otherwise, each payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the manner in which the payment was calculated. 
(3)  No acceptance by the city of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable. 
(4)  The payment is not a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment, except as specifically provided in this title, or as required by applicable law. By way of example, and not limitation, permit fees and business license taxes are not waived and remain applicable and other fees and assessments to recover costs associated with the operation and maintenance of the right-of-way that may be established from time to time by resolution of the city commission. 
(5)  Within ninety (90) calendar days following the end of the calendar year, each person who paid a fee based upon gross revenues or gross receipts shall submit a statement, attested to by a certified public accountant or the chief financial officer of such person, setting forth gross revenues of the communications facility, by category, and describing what revenues were included and what revenues, if any, generated or derived from operations in the city were excluded in the fee calculation, and any adjustments made to gross revenues. If payments are late, in addition to paying any applicable penalties or damages, the person that owes the fee shall pay interest on the amount owed at the statutory interest rates applicable to judgments. 
(6)  The city may, upon fifteen (15) calendar days' advance written notice, inspect and examine any and all books and records reasonably necessary to the determination of whether fees have been accurately computed and paid. 
(7)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a person that is obligated to pay a fee ceases to provide service for any reason (including as a result of a transfer), such person shall make a final payment of any amounts owed to the city within ninety (90) calendar days of the date its operations in the city cease, and shall, to the extent that such fees are based on gross revenues or gross receipts, provide a statement of gross revenues for the calendar year through the dates operations ceased, which statement shall contain the information and certification required by subsection (e)(5). 
(Ord. No. 764, § 2, 6-24-97; Ord. No. 848, 10-14-03) 
Sec. 5.5-104. - General conditions upon use of rights-of-way. 
(a)  Responsibility for costs. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this article or under state law, any act that a communications facility operator, its contractors or subcontractors are required to perform under this section shall be performed at their cost. If a communications facility operator fails to perform work that it is required to perform within the time provided for performance, the city may perform the work and bill the communications facility operator therefor. The communications facility operator shall pay the amounts billed within thirty (30) calendar days, subject to the rights, if any, under F.S. Sections 337.403 and 337.404, as amended. 
(b)  Construction procedures and placement of facilities; obligation to minimize interference with use of rights-of-way. 
(1)  The construction, operation and repair of communications facilities are subject to the supervision of all of the authorities of the city that have jurisdiction in such matters, and shall be performed in compliance with all laws, ordinances, departmental rules and regulations and practices affecting such system. By way of example, and not limitation, this includes zoning codes and safety codes. In addition, the construction, operation and repair shall be performed in a manner consistent with high industry standards. Persons engaged in the construction, operation or repair of communications facilities shall exercise reasonable care in the performance of all their activities, and use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public or to property. 
(2)  All permits required by the City Code or regulations shall be obtained from the proper city officials and all required permit and associated fees paid before any work on a communications facility commences; and all work performed shall be performed in strict accordance with such permits. In any permit so issued, the city may impose, as a condition of the granting of the permit, such conditions and regulations as may be necessary to the management of the right-of-way, including, by way of example and not limitation, conditions requiring notice to affected property owners, conditions imposed for the purpose of protecting any structures in the public rights-of-way, for the proper restoration of such public rights-of-way, and for the protection of the city and the continuity of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
(3)  Without limiting the foregoing, all work on communications facilities within the city shall be performed in accordance with good engineering practices. No work on the facilities shall be performed except by experienced and properly trained personnel. The operator of a communications facility is responsible for all the acts of its contractors and subcontractors, and for ensuring that its contractors and subcontractors perform all work in compliance with this article and any applicable franchise agreement. 
(4)  Operators of communications facilities must follow city-established requirements for placement of facilities in rights-of-way, and must in any event install facilities in a manner that minimizes interference with the use of the rights-of-way by others, including others that may be installing communications facilities. The city may require that facilities be installed at a particular time, place, or manner as a condition of access to a particular right-of-way, and may require a person using the right-of-way to cooperate with others to minimize adverse impacts on the right-of-way through joint trenching and other arrangements. 
(5)  In no case may additional poles or conduit be installed in the right-of-way without the permission of the city; provided, that this provision shall not limit rights to place poles or conduit expressly granted by state or federal law. Any person who is permitted to install poles or conduit that is not subject to the requirements of 47 U.S.C. Section 224 or the equivalent provisions of state law must lease capacity on those poles or in the conduit to others, at a rate not higher than the rate that would be permitted if 47 U.S.C. Section 224 applied. 
(6)  Except as the city may direct otherwise, communications facilities may be constructed overhead where poles exist and electric or [telephone] lines of a local exchange carrier franchised before 1990 are overhead, but where both electric or such telephone lines are underground, or are being initially placed underground (whether voluntarily or at the city's direction), other communications facilities shall be constructed underground. Except as the city may direct otherwise, whenever and wherever the owner of the poles upon which aerial facilities are located moves its plant from overhead to underground placement in an area, all communications facilities in that area shall be similarly moved underground. 
(7)  Any and all public rights-of-way, public property, or private property that is disturbed or damaged during the construction, operation or repair of a communications facility shall be promptly repaired by the communications facility operator. 
(8)  Tree trimming shall be performed in strict accordance with the City Code. 
(c)  Relocation of facilities. 
(1)  A communications facility operator shall, by a time specified by the city, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove any of its property when required by the city by reason of traffic conditions; public safety; public right-of-way construction; public right-of-way repair (including resurfacing or widening); or for any municipal project, including a change of public right-of-way grade; construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes, publicly owned power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any other type of government-owned communications system, public work or improvement or any government-owned utility; public right-of-way vacation; or for any other purpose where the work involved would be aided by the removal or relocation of the communications facility. Collectively, such matters are referred to below as the "public work." 
a.  Except in the case of emergencies, the city shall provide written notice describing where the public work is to be performed at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the deadline by which a communications facility operator must protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove its facilities. A communications facility operator may seek an extension of the time to perform such tasks where they cannot be performed in thirty (30) calendar days, and such request for an extension shall not be unreasonably refused. 
b.  In an emergency, or where a communications facility creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the city may protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove, or relocate any or all parts of the communications facility without prior notice, and charge the communications facility operator for costs incurred. In case of such emergency where, in the judgment of the city, conditions permit, the city shall reasonably attempt to notify the communications facility operator. The determination as to what constitutes an emergency is a matter solely within the discretion of the city, in the exercise of its police powers. 
(2)  If any person, other than a governmental entity, that is authorized to place facilities in the right-of-way requests another communications facility operator receiving the request to protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove, or relocate its facilities to accommodate the construction, operation, or repair of the facilities of such other person, the communications facility operator shall, after thirty (30) calendar days' advance written notice, take action to effect the necessary changes requested. Unless the matter is governed by a valid contract or a state or federal law or regulation, or in other cases where the communications facility that is being requested to move was not properly installed, the cost of the same shall be borne by the party requesting the protection, support, temporary disconnection, removal, or relocation and at no charge to the city. 
(3)  A communications facility operator shall, on the request of any person holding a valid permit issued by a governmental authority, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings or other objects.

(2)  A communications facility operator shall not discriminate among persons or the city or take any retaliatory action against a person or the city because of that entity's exercise of any right it may have under federal, state, or local law, nor may the operator require a person or the city to waive such rights as a condition of taking service. 
(3)  A communications facility operator shall comply with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing equal employment opportunities, as the same may be from time to time amended.

Sec. 5.5-105. - Protection of the city and residents. 
(a)  Indemnification. The city may not enter into any franchise, or otherwise authorize any communications facility operator to use the public rights-of-way, until and unless the city obtains an adequate indemnity from such operator. The indemnity must at least: 
(1)  Release the city from and against any and all liability and responsibility related to or in any way arising out of the communications facility operator's use of the rights-of-way or any property it is authorized or entitled to use as a result of the franchise or other authorization.

At a minimum, the following requirements must be satisfied: 
(1)  A communications facility operator shall not commence construction or operation of the facility without obtaining all insurance required under this section and approval of such insurance by risk management of the city, nor shall a communications facility operator allow any contractor or subcontractor to commence work on its contract or subcontract until all similar such insurance required of the same has been obtained and approved. The required insurance must be obtained and maintained for the entire period the communications facility operator has facilities in the right-of-way, and for a period thereafter as specified in the minimum coverages described below. If the operator, its contractors or subcontractors do not have the required insurance, the city may order such entities to stop operations until the insurance is obtained and approved. 
(2)  Certificates of insurance, reflecting evidence of the required insurance, shall be filed with the risk manager coordinator. For entities that are entering the market, the certificates shall be filed prior to the commencement of construction and once a year thereafter, and as provided below in the event of a lapse in coverage. For entities that have facilities in the right-of-way as of June 24, 1997, the certificate shall be filed within sixty (60) calendar days of the adoption of this article, annually thereafter, and as provided below in the event of a lapse in coverage, unless a pre-existing franchise agreement provides for filing of certificates in a different manner. 
(3)  These certificates of insurance shall contain a provision that coverages afforded under these policies will not be canceled until at least thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice has been given to the city. Policies shall be issued by companies authorized to do business under the laws of the state. Financial ratings must be no less than "A" in the latest edition of Bests Key Rating Guide, published by A.M. Best Guide. Any communications facility operator may self-insure.

Information contained therein is subject to review and approval by the city's risk management division. 
(4)  In the event that the insurance certificate provided indicates that the insurance shall terminate or lapse during the period of this contract, then, in that event, the communications facility operator shall furnish, at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the expiration of the date of such insurance, a renewed certificate of insurance as proof that equal and like coverage for the balance of the period of the franchise or license under which the communications facility operates [exists]. 
(5)  A communications facility operator, and its contractors or subcontractors engaged in work on the operator's behalf in, on, under or over public rights-of-way, shall maintain the following minimum insurance:

5.  Property damage liability insurance shall include coverage for the following hazards: X-explosion, C-collapse, U-underground. 
b.  Workers' compensation insurance shall be maintained during the life of this contract to comply with statutory limits for all employees and, in the case any work is sublet, each communications facility operator shall require the subcontractors similarly to provide workers' compensation insurance for all the latter's employees unless such employees are covered by the protection afforded by each communications facility operator. Each communications facility operator and its contractors and subcontractors shall maintain during the life of this policy employers liability insurance. The following limits must be maintained: 
1.  Workers' compensation ..... Statutory 
2.  Employer's liability, per occurrence ..... $500,000.00

(c)  Performance/payment bonds. Every operator of a communications facility may be required to obtain performance bonds and, if necessary, payment bonds to ensure the faithful performance of its responsibilities under this article and any franchise agreement or license for an initial build, any substantial rebuild, upgrade or extension of its facility, or when construction plans show that there would be more than one thousand (1,000) feet of open trenching in the right-of-way at any given time. The amount of the performance and payment bonds shall be set by the city manager in light of the nature of the work to be performed, and is not in lieu of any additional bonds that may be required through the permitting process. The bond shall be in a form acceptable to the city attorney. The city may from time to time increase the amount of the required performance bond to reflect increased risks to the city and to the public. 
(d)  Security fund. Every communications facility operator shall establish a twenty-five-thousand-dollar cash security fund, or provide the city an irrevocable letter of credit in the same amount, to secure the payment of fees owed, to secure any other performance promised in a franchise agreement, and to pay any taxes, fees or liens owed to the city. The letter of credit shall be in a form and with an institution acceptable to the city attorney and director of financial management. Should the city draw upon the cash security fund or letter of credit, it shall promptly notify the communications facility operator, and the communications facility operator shall promptly restore the fund or the letter of credit to the full required amount. This security fund/letter of credit may be waived or reduced by the city for a franchisee or licensee where the city determines, in its discretion, that a twenty-five-thousand-dollar security fund/letter of credit is not necessary to secure the required performance. The city may from time to time, upon reasonable notice after the communications facility operator has had an opportunity to respond thereto, increase the amount of the required security fund/letter of credit to reflect increased risks to the city and to the public.

(5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, pledges in trust or mortgages of the assets of a franchised or licensed communications facility to secure the construction, operation or repair of the system may be made without application and without the city's prior consent; except, that no such arrangement may be made if it would in any respect under any condition prevent the communications facility operator or any successor from complying with the franchise or license and applicable provisions of the City Code, nor may any such arrangement permit a third party to succeed to the interest of the operator, or to own or control the communications facility, without the prior consent of the city. Any mortgage, pledge or lease shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of the city under this article or other applicable law. 
(c)  Minimum contents of every franchise or license. In addition to satisfying the other applicable requirements of sections 5.5-101 through 5.5-110, every franchise agreement or license for a communications facility may contain the following provisions: 
(1)  The franchise agreement or license shall provide that neither the granting of any franchise or license nor any provision thereof shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power, police power, or regulatory power of the city as may exist at the time the franchise is issued or thereafter be obtained. 
(2)  The franchise agreement or license shall only authorize occupancy of the right-of-way to provide the services and for the purposes described in the franchise or license. 
(3)  A franchise or license shall be a privilege that is held in the public trust and personal to the original franchisee. The franchise agreement or license shall ensure that no transfer of the franchise or license may occur, directly or indirectly, without the prior consent of the city, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, except as contemplated by subsection (b)(5).

(e)  Revocation, reduction of term, or forfeiture of franchise or license. 
(1)  Where, after written notice and providing the licensee or franchisee an opportunity to be heard (if such opportunity is timely requested by a franchisee or licensee), the city finds that the facility is being operated in substantial violation of this article or substantial violation of the terms of the franchise agreement or license, the city may make an appropriate reduction in the remaining term of the franchise or license or to revoke the franchise or license. The city manager is authorized to establish and conduct a proceeding that comports with the requirements of this subsection (1), and to issue a recommended decision, but any such decision may be appealed to the city commission. Any appeal must be filed within thirty (30) calendar days of the decision of the city manager or it shall be deemed waived.Notwithstanding the foregoing, the franchise or license may not be rendered or revoked unless the franchisee or licensee: 
a.  Was given notice of the default; 
b.  Was given thirty (30) calendar days to cure the default; and 
c.  Failed to cure the default, or to propose a schedule for curing the default acceptable to the city where it is impossible to cure the default in thirty (30) calendar days. 
The required notice may be given before the city conducts the proceeding required by this section. No opportunity to cure is required for repeated violations, and fraud shall be deemed incurable. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may declare a franchise or license forfeited where the franchisee or licensee: 
a.  Fails to begin to exercise its rights under the franchise or license within a period specified in the franchise agreement or license; 
b.  Stops providing service it is required to provide in the franchise or license; 
c.  Without the prior consent of the city, transfers the franchise or license; or 
d.  Fails to pay any fees required hereunder, including, but not limited to, annual occupancy fees, franchise fees, license fees, application fees, or permit fees. 
(3)  The city shall give a franchisee or licensee thirty (30) calendar days' notice of an intent to declare a franchise or license forfeited, and shall provide the franchisee or licensee an opportunity to show cause why the franchise or license should not be forfeited. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any franchise or license may, at the option of the city following a public hearing before the city commission, be revoked one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the franchisee or licensee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that one-hundred-twenty-calendar-day period: 
a.  Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or 
b.  Such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this article and the franchise agreement or license and has executed an agreement, approved by a court having jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this article and the franchise agreement or license. 
(5)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee or licensee, the city may revoke the franchise or license, following a public hearing before the city commission, by serving notice upon the franchisee or licensee and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the franchise or license and all rights and privileges of the franchise or license will be revoked and will terminate thirty (30) calendar days after serving such notice, unless: 
a.  The city has approved the transfer of the franchise or license to the successful bidder; and 
b.  The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement or the license and this article. 
(f)  Effect of termination or forfeiture. Upon termination or forfeiture of a license or franchise, whether by action of the city as provided above or by passage of time, the franchisee or licensee shall be obligated to cease using the communications facilities for the purposes authorized by the franchise. The city may either take possession of some or all of the licensee's or franchisee's facilities in the public rights-of-way after furnishing the communications facility operator with written notice and granting the communications facility operator a reasonable period of time, but in no event more than thirty (30) days to remove same, or require the licensee or franchisee or its bonding company to remove some or all of the licensee's or franchisee's facilities from the public rights-of-way and restore the public rights-of-way to their proper condition. Should the franchisee or licensee neglect, refuse, or fail to remove such facility, the city may remove the facility at the expense of the franchisee or licensee. The obligation of the licensee or franchisee to remove shall survive the termination of the franchise or license for a period of two (2) years; provided, that the city may not take possession of, or require the franchisee or licensee to remove, any facilities that are used to provide another service for which the franchisee holds a valid franchise or license issued by the city. 
(g)  Remedies cumulative. All remedies under this article and any franchise agreement or license are cumulative unless otherwise expressly stated. The exercise of one remedy shall not foreclose use of another, nor shall the exercise of a remedy or the payment of liquidated damages or penalties relieve a communications facility operator of its obligations to comply with its franchise or license. Remedies may be used singly or in combination; in addition, the city may exercise any rights it has at law or equity. Recovery by the city of any amounts under insurance, the performance bond, the security fund or letter of credit, or otherwise, does not limit a communications facility operator's duty to indemnify the city in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a communications facility operator of its obligations under a franchise or license, limit the amounts owed to the city, or in any respect prevent the city from exercising any other right or remedy it may have. Nothing herein shall be read to authorize the double recovery of damages. 
(h)  Access to books and records. 
(1)  Each communications facility operator shall, upon thirty (30) calendar days' written notice if reasonably possible, but in no event less than five (5) business days' written notice, provide the city access to all books and records related to the construction, operation, or repair of the communications facility so that the city may inspect these books and records. Any and all nonproprietary or nonconfidential books and records may be copied by the city. To the maximum extent permitted by F.S. Section 166.231(10)(e), such books and records shall be kept confidential and exempt from the provisions of F.S. Section 119.07(1). The operator's obligation includes the obligation, to the extent that the franchise fees or license fees are based upon gross revenue or gross receipts, to produce all books and records related to revenues derived from the operation of the communications facility. An operator is responsible for obtaining or maintaining the necessary possession or control of all books and records related to the construction, operation or repair of the communications facility, so that it can produce the documents upon request. Books and records must be maintained for a period of five (5) years, except that any record that is a public record must be maintained for the period required by state law; and a franchise may specify a shorter period for certain categories of voluminous books and records where the information contained therein can be derived simply from other materials. 
(2)  For purposes of this article, the term "books and records" shall be read expansively to include information in whatever format stored. Books and records requested shall be produced to the city at city hall, except by agreement or pursuant to subsection (h)(3). 
(3)  If any books and records are too voluminous, or for security reasons cannot be copied and moved, then a communications facility operator may request that the inspection take place at some other location mutually agreed to by the city and the operator, provided that the operator must make necessary arrangements for copying documents selected by the city after its review; and the operator must pay all travel and additional copying expenses incurred by the city in inspecting those documents or having those documents inspected by its designee. 
(4)  Without limiting the foregoing, the operator of a communications facility shall provide the city the following within ten (10) calendar days of their receipt or, in the case of documents created by the operator or its affiliate, filing: 
a.  Notices of deficiency or forfeiture related to the operation of the communications facility; and 
b.  Copies of any request for protection under bankruptcy laws, or any judgment related to a declaration of bankruptcy by the operator or by any partnership or corporation that owns or controls the operator directly or indirectly. 
(i)  Retention of records; relation to privacy rights. Each communications facility operator shall take all reasonable steps required, if any, to ensure that it is able to provide the city all information which must be provided or may be requested under this article, a franchise or license agreement, or applicable law, including by providing appropriate subscriber privacy notices. Each operator shall be responsible for redacting any data that applicable law prevents it from providing to the city. Nothing in this section shall be read to require an operator to violate state or federal law protecting subscriber privacy. 
(j)  Reports. The city may require operators of communications facilities to maintain records, and to prepare reports relevant to determining the compliance of the communications facility operator with the terms and conditions of this article and a franchise or license agreement. 
(k)  Maps. Each communications facility operator shall maintain accurate maps and improvement plans which show the location, size, and a general description of all facilities installed in the rights-of-way and any power supply sources, including voltages and connections. Maps shall be based upon post-construction inspection to verify location. The operator of each communications facility shall provide a map to the city showing the location of its facilities, in such detail and scale as may be directed by the city engineer. New maps shall be promptly submitted to the city when the facility expands or is relocated. Copies of maps shall be provided on disk, in a format specified by the city engineer. 
(l)  Compliance with laws. Each franchisee or licensee shall comply with all city laws and regulations heretofore and hereafter adopted or established during the entire term of its franchise or license. 
(m)  Reservation of authority. The city may do all things which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this article. The city manager or its designee is hereby authorized and empowered to adjust, settle or compromise any controversy involving performance or charges arising from the operations of any franchisee or licensee under this article on behalf of the city. The city commission may accept, reject or modify the decision of the city manager, and the city commission may adjust, settle or compromise any controversy or cancel any charge arising from the operations of any franchisee or licensee or from any provision of this article. 
(n)  No waiver. The failure of the city to insist on timely performance or compliance by any person holding a license or franchise shall not constitute a waiver of the city's right to later insist on timely performance or compliance by that person or any other person holding such a license or franchise. 
(o)  Article not a contract. The city expressly reserves the right to amend this article from time to time in the exercise of its lawful powers. This article and any ordinance adopting provisions of this article shall not be construed to be a contract.

(c)  Persons holding leases for property in the right-of-way. Any lessee under a lease from the city for an antenna site located in the right-of-way that is valid and in force on June 24, 1997, may continue to occupy such antenna site to the conclusion of the term of the lease, but not any renewal or extension thereof, in accordance with the terms of such lease; provided, however, that such lessee may elect at any time to apply for a superseding lease, franchise or license under this article.

(Ord. No. 764, § 2, 6-24-97) 
Sec. 5.5-109. - Telecommunications facilities and service providers.

(6)  An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer thereof certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application, and certifying that the application meets all requirements of applicable law. 
(b)  Same-Additional information regarding affiliates; presumptions. To the extent that the applicant is in any respect relying on the financial or technical resources of another person, including another affiliate, the proofs required by subsections (a)(3) through (5) should be provided for that person. An applicant will be presumed to have the requisite financial, or technical or legal qualifications to the extent such qualifications have been reviewed and approved by the state public service commission; or if the applicant is a holder of a franchise in the city for a cable system or open video system, and conduct under the other franchise provides no basis for additional investigation. An applicant that is leasing existing facilities from a franchised communications facility operator, where the applicant will have no responsibility for any activity that involves work in the rights-of-way, may rely upon the franchisee's technical qualifications, and will be presumed to have the necessary financial qualifications. 
(c)  Same-Applications for transfer. An application for a transfer of a franchise must contain the same information required by subsection (a); except, that if the transferor submitted an application pursuant to subsection (a), to the extent information provided by the transferor under subsection (a)(2) remains accurate, the transferee may simply cross-reference the earlier application. 
(d)  Same-City review. The city may request such additional information as it finds necessary and require such modifications to the system proposed as may be necessary in the exercise of the city's authority over telecommunications facilities. Once the information required by the city has been provided, the application shall be promptly reviewed and shall be granted if the city finds that: 
(1)  The applicant has the qualifications to construct, operate and repair the system proposed in conformity with applicable law. The city shall provide a reasonable opportunity to an applicant to show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise under subsection (a)(5)b, by virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of telecommunications facilities. An application for a franchise area shall not be granted if the franchisee has no plans for constructing a system within the entire area for which the franchise is sought. 
(2)  The applicant accepts the modifications required by the city to its proposed system. This section does not authorize the city to exercise authority it does not otherwise have under applicable law. 
(3)  The applicant enters into a franchise agreement and complies with any conditions precedent to its effectiveness. 
(4)  In the case of a transfer, the city must also determine that: 
a.  There will be no adverse effect on the public interest or the city's interest in the franchise; 
b.  The transferee agrees to be bound by all the conditions of the franchise and to assume all the obligations of its predecessor; and 
c.  Any outstanding compliance and compensation issues are resolved or preserved to the satisfaction of the city. 
(5)  An applicant shall not be issued a franchise if it files, or in the previous three (3) years filed, materially misleading information in a franchise application or intentionally withheld information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide. 
(e)  Compensation. 
(1)  Subject only to the exceptions set out in sections 5.5-101 through 5.5-108 of this article, every operator of a telecommunications facility must pay compensation to the city equal to ten (10) percent of gross revenues or as otherwise negotiated in a franchise agreement. 
(2)  The city may accept or require compensation in-kind from an operator of a telecommunications facility; provided, that the city shall not accept in-kind payments from any operator without providing other applicants that apply or have applied within twelve (12) months an opportunity to make an equivalent in-kind payment. 
(3)  A reseller shall pay compensation to the city equal to ten (10) percent of gross revenues or as otherwise negotiated in a franchise agreement. 
(4)  [The term] gross revenues, for purposes of this section, includes all revenue derived directly or indirectly by the operator or, in the case of a reseller, the reseller; or derived directly or indirectly by their affiliates, subsidiaries, parent companies, and any person in whom the operator or reseller has a financial interest, or revenues received by the operator or reseller from a person with whom operator or reseller has a revenue-producing agreement, from the provision of telecommunications services via the telecommunications facility, which provision shall be interpreted to include all services and ancillary equipment; provided, however, that this term shall not include taxes imposed directly upon any subscriber or user by the federal, state, county, or other governmental unit and required to be collected by the operator or reseller; provided further, that a franchisee may deduct from its gross revenues, revenues received from a lessee that holds a franchise under this article, or a reseller, if that lessee or reseller submits a certificate to the telecommunications operator stating that it has paid the fees it owes the city for the applicable reporting period. If such lessee or reseller fails to pay the fees it owes the city for the applicable reporting period, the franchisee shall not deduct from its gross revenues, revenues received from such lessee or reseller. Copies of the certificate must be provided to the city. 
(5)  The compensation paid by each provider shall be publicly disclosed by the city. 
(f)  Additional franchise requirements. In addition to satisfying the requirements of sections 5.5-101 through 5.5-108, every franchise shall specifically reserve the right to require a franchisee to construct facilities or to make payments that may be required to comply with any universal service plan the city may lawfully adopt; and to comply with any lawful requirements to ensure continued quality of telecommunications services, safeguard the right of consumers, or otherwise protect the public safety and welfare.

(8)  An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer thereof certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application, and certifying that the application meets all requirements of applicable law. 
(b)  Same-Additional information regarding affiliates; presumptions. To the extent that the applicant is in any respect relying on the financial or technical resources of another person, including another affiliate, the proofs required by subsections (a)(3) through (5) should be provided for that person. An applicant will be presumed to have the requisite financial, or technical or legal qualifications to the extent such qualifications have been reviewed and approved by a state agency of competent jurisdiction; or if the applicant is a holder of a franchise in the city for a cable system or open video system, and conduct under such other franchise provides no basis for additional investigation. 
(c)  Same-Applications for transfer. An application for a transfer of a franchise must contain the same information required by subsection (a), except that if the transferor submitted an application pursuant to subsection (a), to the extent information provided by the transferor under subsection (a)(2) remains accurate, the transferee may simply cross-reference the earlier application. 
(d)  Same-City review. The city may request such additional information as it finds necessary and require such modifications to the application as may be necessary in the exercise of the city's authority over open video systems. Once the information required by the city has been provided, the application shall be promptly reviewed and shall be granted if the city finds that: 
(1)  The applicant has the qualifications to construct, operate and repair the system proposed in conformity with applicable law. The city shall provide a reasonable opportunity to an applicant to show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise under subsection (a)(5)b, by virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of an open video system. An application for a franchise area shall not be granted if the franchisee has no plans for constructing a system within the entire area for which the franchise is sought. 
(2)  The applicant accepts the modifications required by the city to its proposed system. This section shall not be read to authorize the city to exercise authority it does not otherwise have under applicable law. 
(3)  The applicant enters into a franchise agreement and complies with any conditions precedent to its effectiveness. 
(4)  In the case of a transfer, the city must also determine that: 
a.  There will be no adverse effect on the public interest or the city's interest in the franchise; 
b.  The transferee agrees to be bound by all the conditions of the franchise and to assume all the obligations of its predecessor; and 
c.  Any outstanding compliance and compensation issues are resolved or preserved to the satisfaction of the city. 
(5)  An applicant shall not be issued a franchise if it files, or in the previous three (3) years filed, materially misleading information in a franchise application; or intentionally withheld information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide. 
(e)  Compensation. Every operator of an open video system shall pay compensation to the city as follows: 
(1)  To the extent that the system is used to provide cable services: a percentage of gross revenues (as that term is defined in article II of this chapter as if the open video system operator were a cable operator) each quarter equal to the gross revenue percentage paid by any cable operator for the same quarter. In addition, unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, an open video system operator shall pay to the city, at a time directed by the city, an amount equal to the highest amount contributed by any cable operator under its franchise for and in support of public, educational and government use, including institutional network use, of its cable system. To the extent that a cable operator is providing other support for public, educational or governmental use, the operator must duplicate that support within a time and in a manner directed by the city, or provide a cash equivalent acceptable to the city. In applying this section, the city shall ensure that the obligations borne by the open video system operator are no greater or lesser than the obligation imposed upon the cable operator providing the greatest benefits to the community. The compensation required under this section or specified in a franchise shall increase as the compensation that a cable operator is required to provide, in cash and in other forms, increases. 
(2)  To the extent that the open video system is used for the provision of telecommunications services, the open video system operator shall pay the fee required of a telecommunications service provider. 
(3)  Such other compensation as the city may charge in the future, consistent with federal or state law, including fees imposed upon open video system lessees. 
(f)  Customer service standard certification. An open video system that enters into an agreement to comply with the customer service standards applicable to cable systems may be certified by the city as "Consumer Friendly-City of Wilton Manors" for so long as it complies with those requirements. 
(g)  Interconnection. Every cable or open video system and every cable or open video system operator shall be required to interconnect with every other cable or open video system and cable or open video system operator within the city on fair and reasonable terms for purposes of providing PEG and I-Net services. 
(Ord. No. 764, § 4, 6-24-97) 
Sec. 5.5-111. - Private communications facilities. 
(a)  Application for license. A person wishing to construct, emplace, operate, replace, reconstruct, or maintain a private communications system must obtain a license therefor. The license shall only authorize placement of the system in a specific portion of the public right-of-way for a limited and specific purpose in connection with the person's business, but not encompassing in whole or in part the carriage of telecommunications for hire in the public right-of-way, and for a limited period of time. Such application must be in the form provided for by regulation and must be accompanied by a filing fee, the amount of which must be fixed designated by regulation, promulgated from time to time by the city. 
(b)  Conditions of license. Any license shall be subject to such conditions as the city may from time to time establish, shall be expressly subordinate to the use of the rights-of-way by operators of communications facilities, and shall otherwise conform to the requirements of this article. Subject to the foregoing, the provisions of subsections 5.5-104(a) through (f) shall apply to a private communications system as if it were a communications facility. 
(c)  Compensation. The owner of a private communications facility shall pay, in addition to the annual occupancy fee, a fee established by the city from time to time to reflect the fair market value of the property used.

ARTICLE IV. - COMMUNICATIONS RIGHTS-OF-WAY[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 821, §§ 3-22, adopted June 26, 2001, did not specifically amend the Code; hence inclusion as art. IV, §§ 5.5-131-5.5-150 was at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 5.5-131. - Title. 
    This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the City of Wilton Manors Communications Rights-of-Way Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 821, § 3, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 5.5-132. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is the intent of the city to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by: providing for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way within city; adopting and administering reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with state and federal law, including § 337.401, Florida Statutes (2000), as it may be amended, city's home-rule authority, and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other federal and state law; establishing reasonable rules and regulations necessary to manage the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way by all communications services providers; and minimizing disruption to the public rights-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 821, § 4, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 5.5-133. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this ordinance, the following terms, phrases, words, and abbreviations shall have the meanings given herein, unless otherwise expressly stated. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future tense; words in the plural number include the singular number; and words in the singular number include the plural number; and the masculine gender includes the feminine gender. "And" and "or" may be read conjunctively or disjunctively. The words "shall" and "will" are mandatory, and "may" is permissive. Unless otherwise expressly stated, words not defined in this ordinance shall be given the meaning set forth in Title 47 of the United States Code, and, if not defined therein, their common and ordinary meaning. References to governmental entities (whether persons or entities) refer to those entities or their successors in authority. If specific provisions of law referred to herein are renumbered, then the reference shall be read to refer to the renumbered provision. Reference to laws, ordinances or regulations shall be interpreted broadly to cover government actions, however nominated, and include laws, ordinances and regulations now in force or hereinafter enacted or amended. 
    "Abandonment" shall mean the permanent cessation of all uses of a communications facility; provided that this term shall not include cessation of all use of a facility within a physical structure where the physical structure continues to be used. For example, cessation of all use of a cable within a conduit, where the conduit continues to be used, shall not be "abandonment" of a facility in public rights-of-way. 
    "City" shall mean City of Wilton Manors, Florida. 
    "Communications services" shall mean the transmission, conveyance or routing of voice, data, audio, video, or any other information or signals to a point, or between or among points, by or through any electronic, radio, satellite, cable, optical, microwave, or other medium or method now in existence or hereafter devised, regardless of the protocol used for such transmission or conveyance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this ordinance "cable service", as defined in § 202.11(2), Florida Statutes (2000), as it may be amended, is not included in the definition of "communications services" and cable service providers or providers of service via an open video system may be subject to other ordinances of the city. 
    "Communications services provider" shall mean any person providing communications services through the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. "Communications services provider" shall also include any person that places or maintains a communications facility in public rights-of-way but does not provide communications services. 
    "Communications facility" or "facility" or "system" shall mean any permanent or temporary plant, equipment or property, including but not limited to cables, wires, conduits, ducts, fiber optics, poles, antennae, converters, splice boxes, cabinets, hand holes, manholes, vaults, drains, surface location markers, appurtenances, and other equipment or pathway placed or maintained or to be placed or maintained in the public rights-of-way of the city and used or capable of being used to transmit, convey, route, receive, distribute, provide or offer communications services. 
    "FCC" shall mean the Federal Communications Commission. 
    "In public rights-of-way" or "in the public rights-of-way" shall mean in, on, over, under or across the public rights-of-way. 
    "Ordinance" shall mean this ordinance. 
    "Person" shall include any individual, children, firm, association, joint venture, partnership, estate, trust, business trust, syndicate, fiduciary, corporation, organization or legal entity of any kind, successor, assignee, transferee, personal representative, and all other groups or combinations, and shall include city to the extent the city acts as a communications services provider. 
    "Place or maintain" or "placement or maintenance" or "placing or maintaining" shall mean to erect, construct, install, maintain, grade, excavate, place, repair, extend, replace, expand, remove, occupy, locate or relocate. A communications services provider that owns or exercises physical control over communications facilities in public rights-of-way, such as the physical control to maintain and repair, is "placing or maintaining" the facilities. A party providing service only through resale or only through use of a third party's unbundled network elements is not "placing or maintaining" the communications facilities through which such service is provided. The transmission and receipt of radio frequency signals through the airspace of the public rights-of-way does not constitute "placing or maintaining" facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
    "Public rights-of-way" shall mean a public right-of-way, public utility easement, public highway, street, lane, bridge, sidewalk, road, waterway, tunnel, alley, or similar property for which the city is the authority that has jurisdiction and control and may lawfully grant access to such property pursuant to applicable law, and includes the surface, the air space over the surface and the area below the surface to the extent the city holds a property interest therein. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include private property. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include any real or personal city property except as described above and shall not include city buildings, fixtures, poles, conduits, facilities or other structures or improvements, regardless of whether they are situated in the public rights-of-way. No reference herein, or in any permit, to public rights-of-way shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the city that its interest or other right to control the use of such property is sufficient to permit its use for such purposes, and a registrant shall be deemed to gain only those rights to use as are properly in the city and as the city may have the undisputed right and power to give. 
    "Registrant" shall mean a communications services provider or other person that has registered with the city in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
    "Registration" or "register" shall mean the process described in this ordinance whereby a communications services provider provides certain information to the city. 
(Ord. No. 821, § 5, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 5.5-134. - Registration for placing or maintaining communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(a)  A communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall first register with the city in accordance with this ordinance. Subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in this ordinance, a registrant may place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. A communications services provider with an existing communications facility in the public rights-of-way of the city as of the effective date of this ordinance shall comply with this ordinance within sixty (60) days from the effective date of this ordinance, including, but not limited to, registration, or be in violation hereof. 
(b)  A registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the public rights-of-way. Registration under this ordinance governs only the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the city's or another person's facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from complying with all applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, including this ordinance. 
(c)  Each communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall file a single registration with the city which shall include the following information: 
(1)  Name of the applicant; 
(2)  Name, address and telephone number of the applicant's primary contact person in connection with the registration and the person to contact in case of an emergency; 
(3)  For registrations submitted prior to October 1, 2001, the applicant shall state whether it provides local service or toll service or both; 
(4)  Evidence of the insurance coverage required under this ordinance and acknowledgment that registrant has received and reviewed a copy of this ordinance; 
(5)  A copy of the applicant's certificate of authorization or license to provide communications services issued by the Florida Public Service Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or other federal or state authority, if any; 
(6)  For an applicant that does not provide a Florida Public Service Commission certificate of authorization number, if the applicant is a corporation, proof of authority to do business in the State of Florida, including the number of the certificate of incorporation; and 
(7)  A security fund in accordance with this ordinance. 
(d)  The city manager, or his designee shall review the information submitted by the applicant. If the applicant submits information in accordance with subsection (c) above, the registration shall be effective and the city shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the city determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with subsection (c) above, the city shall notify the applicant of the non-effectiveness of registration, and reasons for the non-effectiveness, in writing. The city shall so reply to an applicant within thirty (30) days after receipt of registration information from the applicant. 
(e)  A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the city and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(f)  Registration shall not in itself establish any right to place or maintain or priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the city, but shall establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by the city. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this ordinance and further subject to any additional city's ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted. 
(g)  A registrant shall renew its registration with the city by April 1 of even numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this ordinance, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even numbered year. Within thirty (30) days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection (c), except, as of October 1, 2001, subsection (c)(3), a registrant shall provide updated information to the city. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services provider has complied with the registration requirements of this ordinance. 
(h)  In accordance with applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations and this ordinance, a permit shall be required of a communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition precedent to obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall continue to apply. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met. 
(i)  A registrant that places or maintains communications facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be required to pay compensation to the city as required by applicable law and ordinances of the city. 
(Ord. No. 821, § 6, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 5.5-135. - Transfer, sale or assignment of assets in public rights-of-way. 
    If a registrant transfers, sells or assigns its assets located in public rights-of-way incident to a transfer, sale or assignment of the registrant's assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to comply with the terms of this ordinance. Written notice of any such transfer, sale or assignment shall be provided by such registrant to the city within twenty (20) days after the effective date of the transfer, sale or assignment. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee is not required to re-register. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is not a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee shall register as provided in section 5.5-132 within sixty (60) days of the transfer, sale or assignment. 
    If permit applications are pending in the registrant's name, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall notify the community services department that the transferee, buyer or assignee is the new applicant. 
    Any encumbrance on the communications facilities of the registrant in the public rights-of-way shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of the city under this ordinance and applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 821, § 7, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 5.5-136. - Placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(a)  Registrant shall at all times comply with and abide by all applicable provisions of state, federal and local law and city ordinances, codes and regulations in placing or maintaining a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(b)  A registrant shall not commence to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way until all applicable permits, if any, have been issued by the city or other appropriate authority, except in the case of an emergency. The term "emergency" shall mean a condition that affects the public's health, safety or welfare, which includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of a pre-existing service. Registrant shall provide prompt notice to the city of the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the event of an emergency and shall be required to obtain an after-the-fact permit within two (2) business days if a permit would have originally been required to perform the work undertaken in public rights-of-way in connection with the emergency. Registrant acknowledges that as a condition of granting such permits, the city may impose reasonable rules or regulations governing the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. Permits shall apply only to the areas of public rights-of-way specifically identified in the permit. The city may issue a blanket permit to cover certain activities, such as routine maintenance and repair activities, that may otherwise require individual permits. 
(c)  As part of any permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way, the registrant shall provide the following: 
(1)  An engineering plan signed and sealed by a Florida registered professional engineer, or prepared by a person who is exempt from such registration requirements as provided in Section 471.003, Florida Statutes, identifying the location of the proposed facility, including a description of the facilities to be installed, where it is to be located, and the approximate size of facilities and equipment that will be located in public rights-of-way; 
(2)  A description of the manner in which the facility will be installed (i.e. anticipated construction methods or techniques); 
(3)  A maintenance of traffic plan for any disruption of the public rights-of-way; 
(4)  Information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed facility, if available (such information shall be provided without certification as to correctness, to the extent obtained from other persons with facilities in the public rights-of-way); 
(5)  If appropriate given the facility proposed, an estimate of the cost of restoration to the public rights-of-way; 
(6)  The timetable for construction of the project or each phase thereof, and the areas of the city which will be affected; and 
(7)  Such additional information requested by the city that the city finds reasonably necessary to review such permit application. 
(d)  To the extent not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within a particular area of public rights-of-way. The city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within the public rights-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests to place and maintain facilities in that area of the public rights-of-way, for the protection of existing facilities in the public rights-of-way or to accommodate city plans for public improvements or projects that the city determines are in the public interest. 
(e)  All communications facilities shall be placed and maintained so as not to unreasonably interfere with the use of the public rights-of-way by the public and with the rights and convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the public rights-of-way. All facilities shall be placed underground to the extent that similarly situated utilities (electric, communications, etc.) are so required.

(e)  Discontinuance of law enforcement response. The failure of an alarm user to make payment of any civil penalty(ies) assessed under this chapter within thirty (30) days from the due date of the invoice may result in discontinuance of law enforcement response to alarm signals that may occur at the premises described in the alarm user's permit until payment is received. In addition, failure to register and obtain an alarm permit may result in no law enforcement response to an unregistered alarm.

The failure to give notice of appeal within this time period shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest the assessment of penalty(ies) or other enforcement decision. 
(b)  Administrative process. Appeals shall be heard by a special magistrate during an administrative process established by the city. The alarm user shall pay a fifty dollars ($50.00) administrative fee for such process.

(c)  Appeal standard. The special magistrate shall review an appeal from the assessment of civil penalty(ies) or other enforcement decision using a preponderance of the evidence standard. Notwithstanding a determination that the preponderance of the evidence supports the assessment of civil penalty(ies) or other enforcement decision, the special magistrate shall have the discretion to dismiss or reduce civil penalty(ies) or reverse any other enforcement decision where warranted. The special magistrate's decision is subject to review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. The decision of the special magistrate is final as to administrative remedies within the city, but does not preclude an appeal to any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)  Fees and costs. Fees and costs incurred either as service charges for false alarms, late fees, violations and/or hearing assessments shall constitute a lien against the premises to the same extent as a lien for special assessment, and with the same penalties and same rights of collection for foreclosure sale and forfeitures obtained for special assessment liens, and may be handled in that manner by the city. It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse or fail to pay any cost assessed pursuant to this article. The refusal or failure to make payment within thirty (30) days of being notified of such expenses after assessment or once an appeal has been concluded shall constitute a separate offense against the city. 
(Ord. No. 931, § 3, 4-8-2008) 
Sec. 7-10. - Government immunity. 
    Alarm registration is not intended to, nor will it, create a contract, duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, of response. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure to respond to a notification is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By applying for an alarm registration, the alarm user acknowledges that law enforcement response may be influenced by factors such as: the availability of police units, priority of calls, weather conditions, traffic conditions, emergency conditions, staffing levels and prior response history.

    These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of City of Wilton Manors, Florida, hereinafter referred to as "this chapter." 
(Ord. No. 2013-0014, § 2, 9-10-13) 
Sec. 9-2. - Scope. 
    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(Ord. No. 2013-0014, § 2, 9-10-13) 
Sec. 9-3. - Intent. 
    The purposes of this chapter and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22.

Sec. 9.5-32. - Findings. 
    It is hereby ascertained, determined and declared: 
(1)  The city commission has determined that ad valorem tax revenue and other revenues will not be sufficient to provide the capital improvements and additions to the city park system that are necessary to accommodate new residential construction within the city. 
(2)  The city has the responsibility to provide parks and recreational facilities in the city park system. Residential construction occurring within the city impacts upon the city park system; therefore, residential construction should pay its fair share of the cost of maintaining the city's existing level of service. 
(3)  Development necessitated by the growth contemplated in the Comprehensive Plan will require improvements and additions to the city park system to accommodate the development generated by such growth and maintain the standards of service currently provided by the city. 
(4)  Implementation of the park impact fee to require residential construction to contribute its fair share of the cost of required improvements and additions to the city park system is an integral and vital element of the regulatory plan of growth management incorporated in the Comprehensive Plan of the city. 
(5)  The imposition of the park impact fee promotes the general welfare of the citizens of the City of Wilton Manors, serves a public purpose and is intended to provide a source of revenue to fund the construction of improvements to the city park system necessitated by growth as delineated in the land use and capital improvement element of the Comprehensive Plan. 
(6)  The city commission finds that the maintenance of the standards for the city park system as contained in the park impact fee study and the provision of the improvements and additions to the city park system benefits all residential construction within the city which benefit is in excess of the park impact fee and, therefore, the park impact fee shall be imposed in all incorporated areas of the city. 
(7)  The standard of service to be provided in the city park system and the allocation of projected costs required to accommodate the needs of future residential construction as presented in the study entitled "City of Wilton Manors Parks and Recreational Facilities Impact Fee Study," dated September, 2005, is hereby approved and adopted by the city and such study is found to be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan of the city. 
(8)  The required improvements and additions to the city park system needed to eliminate any deficiencies shall be financed by revenue sources of the city other than the park impact fees. 
(Ord. No. 888, art. I, 11-22-05)

Further, this term shall not apply to official citations or notices provided pursuant to governmental authority. 
(b)  Prohibition of right-of-way canvassers and solicitors. 
(1)  Findings; purpose; intent. 
a.  The city commission of the City of Wilton Manors desires to adopt an ordinance restricting right-of-way canvassers and solicitors to certain streets and roadways located in the city because such canvassers and solicitors pose a danger to themselves and the public at large by interfering with the safe movement of normal vehicular traffic; and 
b.  According to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles 2007 Florida Traffic Crash Statistics Report, five hundred thirty (530) pedestrians were killed on Florida roadways in 2007; sixty-five (65) of those pedestrians were killed on roadways in Broward County; and 
c.  Based upon statistics collected by the Surface Transportation Policy Project, the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area is one of the most dangerous areas in the United States for pedestrians; and 
d.  Numerous types of right-of-way canvassers and solicitors may seek to operate within the City of Wilton Manors, including, but not limited to, children, adolescents and adults who seek to collect money for school and community activities; vendors who sell flowers, newspapers and other products; and people who seek donations or distribute written information; and 
e.  Right-of-way canvassers and solicitors approach motorists and passengers in motor vehicles engaged in travel on roads, and are particularly susceptible and vulnerable to serious injury, or death due to the speed and number of motorists who operate vehicles on busy roads within the city; and 
f.  Roads are primarily designed for vehicular traffic and are not suited to safely accommodate right-of way canvassers and solicitors; and 
g.  According to 2008-2012 statistical data collected by Florida Department of Transportation, the city ranked 13 th in the state among Florida's 121 small cities (population three thousand (3,000) to fourteen thousand nine hundred ninety-nine (14,999)) for having the most pedestrian related injury and fatality accidents. Neighboring cities ranked 2 nd and 8 th in their respective classifications; and Broward County ranked 2 nd in the state in having the most pedestrian related injury and fatality accidents; and 
h.  According to the Wilton Manors Police Department, ninety-three (93) percent of all traffic and pedestrian accidents within the city occur on the subject roadways identified in subsection (c), including ninety-four (94) percent of all pedestrian-related accidents; and 
i.  The presence of right-of-way canvassers and solicitors interferes with the safe movement of normal vehicular traffic; and 
j.  The road network in the city is substantially burdened by a high volume of traffic, and road design frequently includes complex vehicle turn movements that demand a driver's strict attention; and 
k.  It is the intention of the city commission to use the least restrictive means to advance the significant governmental interests of traffic safety and public safety and, consequently, the city staff analyzed each of the major roads within the city and determined that the roads listed in subsection (c) below present an increased and significant danger for use by distracted drivers, pedestrians and right-of-way canvassers and solicitors and pose the greatest threat to traffic and public safety in reference to activities and use by right-of-way canvassers and solicitors. And therefore the city commission has determined that such activities and use by right-of way vendors and solicitors shall be prohibited on the roads listed in subsection (c); and 
l.  It is the finding of the city commission that many other alternative channels of communication (other than right-of-way canvassing and solicitation on the prohibited roadways) exist for persons who seek to exercise their First Amendment freedoms, such as, but by no means limited to, solicitation of funds or distribution of literature through the mail or at alternate locations (such as houses of worship, shopping areas and special events); the sale and/or distribution of newspapers through home or office delivery, vending machines and retail stores; and the sale of goods and services at retail stores, through the internet and from vending machines; and 
m.  The city commission desires to preserve and protect the personal safety and quality of life of its residents and of those who use streets within the city, both pedestrians and motorists alike; and 
n.  The city commission has reviewed the proposed regulations provided by this section and finds that such regulations accomplish the purposes intended while utilizing the least restrictive means; and 
o.  The city commission finds that it is in the best interests of the residents of the city to adopt this section. 
(c)  Prohibited roadways. It shall be unlawful for any person to act as a right-of-way canvasser or solicitor at or within two hundred (200) feet from the lateral curb or boundary line of any intersection located on the following roadways: N.E. 26 th Street, Wilton Drive (SR 811), Dixie Highway, Oakland Park Blvd. (SR 816), N. Andrews Avenue, N.W. 9 th Avenue (SR 845), and N.E. 6 th Avenue. 
(d)  Chapter 316, Florida Statutes. The enforcement of this section shall not, in any way, preclude the enforcement of F.S. § 316.130(5), as applicable. 
(e)  Enforcement and penalties. 
(1)  It shall be the duty of any police officer of the city to require any person seen soliciting or canvassing and who is not known by the officer to be duly permitted, to produce his solicitor's or canvasser's permit, and to enforce the provisions of this chapter against any person found in violation thereof. 
(2)  Any person who violates any terms or provisions of this section shall be prosecuted before a court of competent jurisdiction and, upon conviction of such violation before the judge of the county court, shall be subject to the penalties prescribed by the county judge. Each day of violation of any term or provision of this article shall constitute a separate and distinct violation. Any person who violates this section shall further be subject to the code enforcement provisions of chapter 2, article III division 2 of the City Code, and the penalties set forth in section 1-15 of the City Code, as well as any other penalties provided by law.

However, a pain medication license must be obtained prior to the issuance of a business tax receipt. 
(b)  Pain medication licensing procedure. Any pain management clinic or pharmacy holding a license duly granted by the State of Florida to prescribe or dispense schedule II controlled substances may apply for a pain medication license. Such application shall be processed using the procedures and criteria listed in this article. In the event that such an establishment is under contract for sale, the current owner and the potential future owner, under contract, must submit a joint application for a pain medication license. The fee for the issuance of the pain medication license shall be the same as for a new license and shall be paid prior to issuance of the license. A pain medication license granted to a duly licensed establishment shall allow the pain management clinic or pharmacy to lawfully prescribe and/or dispense schedule II substances within the city. Pain medication licenses are hereby deemed to be a privilege granted by the city commission, and are declared to be and are regulatory in nature, and revocable pursuant to the procedures set forth in this chapter. The pain medication license application shall be submitted prior to the submission of an application for a building or sign permit. 
(c)  Revocation of existing pain medication licenses and approvals, and establishment of pain medication licensing procedure. The ability to prescribe and/or dispense schedule II substances within the city is hereby declared to be and is a privilege subject to review and approval, suspension, termination, and the imposition of conditions as provided below, and no person may reasonably rely upon the granting of or the continuation of that privilege. Pain management clinics and pharmacies, as defined under section 10-249 of this article, that do not fall under an exemption and that wish to prescribe or dispense schedule II substances after January 7, 2012, including: any pain management clinic or pharmacy to whom an authorization or approval for prescribing or dispensing has previously been granted by the city or which was not previously required to obtain any city approval, shall be required to make an application and receive approval for a pain medication license no later than January 7, 2012.

ARTICLE II. - SEX OFFENDERS AND SEXUAL PREDATORS 

Sec. 12-6. - Findings and intent. 
(a)  Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders and sexual predators are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders and sexual predators commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
(b)  It is the intent of this article to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence.

No. 923, § 6, adopted August 28, 2007, states that the plan shall close to new employees hired after the effective date of the city's participation in the Florida Retirement System. Current members shall be permitted a one (1) time option to elect to stay in the plan or transition to the Florida Retirement System. Members who elect to stay in the plan shall not be precluded from subsequently participating in the Florida Retirement System as required by Florida Law. Members shall have thirty (30) days from the date the city notifies the PBA that the State of Florida has approved the city's participation in the Florida Retirement System to make their election. Failure to elect to participate in FRS shall constitute an election to remain in the plan. Members electing to participate in the Florida Retirement System shall only be entitled to receive a refund of their employee contributions, plus interest, and by so electing shall surrender their right to a benefit from the plan. The city shall pay the cost of purchasing up to five (5) years of prior service with the city for all members who elect to transfer to the Florida Retirement System. The city shall also pay the cost of purchasing up to five (5) years of prior service with the city for members currently in the DROP, in an amount not to exceed the amount of the member's service in the DROP. The city shall not pay for the cost of prior service for future DROP participants who elect to remain in the plan.

    Accrued benefit shall mean, with respect to each member as of any point in time on or before his or her normal retirement date, the benefit accrued under the plan, at such time which is payable upon the member's normal retirement date, under the normal form of payment. For any member who has reached his or her normal retirement date, the accrued benefit is the benefit determined as of any point in time payable under the normal form of payment. A member's accrued benefit is calculated under the following formula: 
Three (3) per cent of final average monthly compensation multiplied by the member's credited service as of the date of determination. 
In no event will a member's accrued benefit at any point in time exceed the maximum amounts as described under section 13.5-60. 
    Accumulated contributions shall mean the sum of all required contributions paid by a member plus pick-up contributions together with interest as provided under subsection 13.5-54(4). 
    Actuarial equivalent shall mean the equality in value of the aggregate amounts of benefits under different forms of payment based upon the following actuarial assumption: Where the actuarial equivalent calculation involves the determination of the present value of a benefit or a conversion from one form of periodic payment to another form of payment, actuarial equivalent amounts will be based upon the 1951 Group Annuity Mortality Table projected by Scale C to 1965 with interest at seven (7) per cent where the member's age will be set back two (2) years and the beneficiary's age will be set back three (3) years for all calculations.

(2)  Pick-up contributions. The city will pick-up, rather than deduct, all regular contributions of members. The city will derive pick-up contributions from the same sources of funds it has used in compensating members of the plan and will do so by reducing the basic compensation for each member. 
    The contribution rate for police officers will be ten (10) per cent of basic compensation and the contribution rate for general employees will be eleven (11) per cent of basic compensation. 
    All pick-up contributions will be considered as employee contributions for the purposes of the plan and treated as employer contributions for the purposes of determining tax treatment in compliance with Section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(3)  City contributions. The city will make annual contributions in the amount certified by the board of trustees as being necessary to maintain the fund on a sound actuarial basis as defined by Article X, Section 14 of the Constitution of the State of Florida, F.S. Ch. 112, Part VII of Florida Statutes and F.S. Ch. 185. City contributions will be deposited into the trust fund on at least a monthly basis. 
(4)  Accumulated contributions. Accumulated contributions consist of all employee contributions and pick-up contributions for a member as defined under subsections (1) and (2) above, and may include accumulated interest at an annual rate as determined periodically by the board of trustees. The interest, if any, will be applied on a semi-annual basis on March 31st and September 30th of each year. Effective January 1, 1998, any member terminating membership in the plan with less than one year of credited service shall receive a return of contributions with no interest. A member who has completed more than one but less than five years of credited service shall receive a return of contributions plus three (3) per cent of the gross amount. Any vested member who elects a return of contributions in lieu of other benefits in the plan will receive interest on an annual basis. Effective April 1, 1996, the annual rate of interest is three (3) per cent. 
(5)  State contributions. The city will participate in the insurance premium rebate program established pursuant to F.S. Ch. 185, and will maintain all provisions of the plan as are required for continued participation in that program. All monies received pursuant to that program will be utilized and applied in accordance with F.S. Ch. 185. 
(6)  Review of sufficiency of employee contributions. The board of trustees will, every two (2) years, review the contribution rate set forth in subsection (2) above to determine its continuing validity. The board will adjust the employee contribution rate as is necessary to maintain the actuarial soundness of the plan. 
(Ord. No. 782, 8-25-98) 
Sec. 13.5-55. - Retirement benefits. 
(1)  Normal retirement. The monthly benefit to which a member will be entitled upon reaching his or her normal retirement date as described under section 13.5-51, is an amount equal to the member's accrued benefit, as described under section 13.5-51, calculated as of date of termination of service with the city. The monthly normal retirement benefit will be payable under the normal form of payment or the member may elect to receive his other benefits under an optional form of payment as described under subsection (4) below in lieu of the normal form of payment. 
(2)  Delayed retirement. A member may retire after reaching his or her normal retirement date and commence receiving a monthly delayed retirement benefit on the first day of any month following his or her termination of service with the city. However, benefit payment must commence on the April 1st of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the April 1st following the calendar year in which the member retires. The member's delayed retirement benefit will be equal to his or her accrued benefit calculated as of the member's date of termination of service. The monthly delayed retirement benefit will be payable under the normal form of payment or the member may elect to receive his or her benefits under an optional form of payment as described under subsection (4) below, in lieu of the normal form of payment. 
(3)  Early retirement. A member may elect to retire on an early retirement date which is the first day of any month after meeting the eligibility requirements as described under section 13.5-51. 
    A member may elect to receive early retirement benefits under either a deferred payment or an immediate payment as follows: 
(a)  A monthly deferred retirement benefit commencing on the member's normal retirement date which will be an amount equal to the member's accrued benefit calculated as of his or her date of termination from the service of the city; or 
(b)  A monthly immediate retirement benefit commencing on the member's early retirement date. The immediate early retirement benefit will be an amount equal to the member's accrued benefit as of his or her date of termination of service with the city, reduced for early retirement. The reduction factor applied to the member's accrued benefit will be three (3) per cent for each full year, calculated based upon complete years and months, that the members' early retirement date precedes his or her normal retirement date, but may not exceed a maximum of twelve (12) per cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the attainment of age fifty (50) and the completion of fifteen (15) or more years of credited service, the city manager, department directors, assistant department directors and the planner shall be entitled to apply for immediate early retirement and shall be entitled to receive their full accrued benefit, without any early retirement reduction. 
(c)  Current active participants who have a minimum of fifteen (15) years of credited service with the city as of October 31, 2006 and who retire on or before September 30, 2009, shall receive an accrued benefit, without any early retirement reduction, on what would have been their normal retirement date, as if the member had remained continuously employed, equal to three (3) per cent of final average monthly compensation multiplied by the member's actual credited service up through and including the member's date of retirement. 
(4)  Optional forms of payment. The normal form of payment for receiving retirement benefits from the plan is a life annuity which is a monthly benefit payable to the member during his or her lifetime. In lieu of receiving benefits under the normal form of payment, the member may elect to receive benefits of an actuarial equivalent value under one of the following options: 
Option I: Ten years certain and life thereafter. A member may elect to receive a reduced monthly benefit payable to the member during his or her lifetime with a guaranteed minimum of one hundred twenty (120) payments. If the member should die prior to receiving one hundred twenty (120) payments, the remaining benefit will be paid to the member's designated beneficiary. 
Option 2: Joint and contingent. A member may elect to receive a reduced monthly benefit for his or her lifetime and have the benefit or a designated fraction of the benefit (fifty (50) percent, seventy-five (75) percent or one hundred (100) percent) continued after the member's death during the lifetime of the designated beneficiary. In the event that the beneficiary dies before the member's benefit payments begin, this option will be canceled automatically and a retirement income will be payable to the member as if the election had never been made. If the designated beneficiary dies after the member's benefit payments begin, the member's monthly benefit payment will remain the same amount and the contingent benefit will be canceled. A retired member who has elected this form of payment may subsequently change his or her designated beneficiary subject to the consent of the board of trustees and provided that the deleted beneficiary is still alive at the date of deletion. Any substituted beneficiary will receive only the actuarial equivalent amount of the benefit which would have been received by the beneficiary who was deleted. 
(5)  Beneficiary. A beneficiary is the person designated by a member who is entitled to receive benefits from the plan upon the death of such member. Such designation must be made by the member in writing on a form provided by the board of trustees and filed with the board. A member may change his or her designated beneficiary any time prior to retirement by filing a new form with the board designating the new beneficiary. 
    If a written designation of beneficiary has not been filed with the board as of the member's death, or if the person designated as beneficiary is not living at the time of the member's death, any benefits payable on behalf of such deceased member will be payable to the designated contingent beneficiary, or if there was no designation made for a contingent beneficiary, to the member's child, parent or other blood relative or to the member's estate, at the discretion of the board. Any payment made to any person pursuant to the power of discretion conferred upon the board by the provisions of this subsection will operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the plan with respect to such deceased member and shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
(6)  Contingent beneficiary. A contingent beneficiary shall be the person designated by the member to receive benefits payable to the member, in the event of the death of both the member and the member's beneficiary. A contingent beneficiary must be designated by the member during his or her life, in writing, on a form prescribed by the board of trustees and filed with the board. 
    In the event that the designation of a contingent beneficiary has not been made or the designated contingent beneficiary is not living upon the death of the deceased member's beneficiary, any remaining benefits payable on behalf of such member will be payable at the discretion of the board as provided in subsection (5) above. 
(7)  Benefits payable to minors and incompetents. If any member or beneficiary is a minor or is under any other legal disability, the board of trustees shall have the power to withhold payment of benefits until the board is presented with proof satisfactory to the board of the appointment of a guardian. If the board becomes aware that any member or beneficiary is incapable of personally receiving and giving a valid receipt for any payment due under the plan, the board shall cause notice to be given to that member or beneficiary of a hearing to determine whether said benefits should continue to be paid until the appointment of a guardian. During the pendency of any such hearing, however, the board may continue to pay benefits to the member or beneficiary and such payment shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the plan for such payment. 
(Ord. No. 782, 8-25-98; Ord. No. 832, § 2, 5-27-03; Ord. No. 923, § 3, 8-28-07) 
Sec. 13.5-56. - Disability retirement. 
(1)  Definition. A member will be considered disabled under the plan, as determined by the board of trustees, if the member has suffered an illness, injury or disease which renders the member permanently and totally incapacitated, physically or mentally, from regular and continuous duty as a police officer or general employee. The definition of disability will be applied to police officers, who because of illness, injury or disease, cannot perform any certified law enforcement job within the police department which is within the member's physical or mental capabilities and further provided that a vacancy exists which has been made available by the city. The definition of disability in the case of a general employee will be applied to an individual who because of illness, injury, or disease, cannot perform any job within the city work force which is within the member's physical or mental capabilities and further provided that a vacancy exists which has been made available by the city. Eligibility for disability retirement will be determined by the board of trustees based upon the provisions of the plan and will be categorized under one of the following two classifications: 
(a)  Service-connected disability. A member will be eligible for a disability retirement from the entry date into the plan if the disability arises from the course and scope of employment. In the case of a police officer, the presumption set forth in F.S. § 185.34 will apply. 
(b)  Nonservice-connected disability. In order to be eligible for a nonservice-connected disability retirement, a member must be fully vested in his or her plan benefits as described under section 13.5-51. 
Disability shall not be determined based solely on the fact that a member cannot perform all of the duties of the member's classification as set forth in the job description. The city shall be required to accommodate disabled workers in accordance with state and federal law and shall not withhold assignment to vacant positions on the basis that a member is not capable of performing all of the tasks of that job. A disability benefit cannot be based on a condition which pre-existed membership in the plan unless the cause of the disability would reasonably be expected to give rise to a disability without the pre-existing condition. 
(2)  Application for disability. Application for disability retirement will be made on a form prescribed by the board of trustees. The member should execute such medical releases as are necessary to permit the board to review the medical records needed to determine the question of disability and to discuss said records at a public meeting. 
(3)  Proof of disability. Upon receipt of an application for disability, the board of trustees will appoint a medical committee to be composed of not less than one nor more than three licensed physicians. The applicant for disability will be required to submit to examination by the medical committee. The medical committee will report its findings to the board which will include a determination, to the extent reasonably possible, the origin of the disability, whether the disability is permanent, and whether the disability is total. In making that determination, the medical committee will be bound by the definition of disability set forth in this plan. 
    Upon receipt of the report of the medical committee, the trustees will schedule a public hearing at which time the board will review all reports of the medical committee, together with any such documentary evidence as the applicant may wish to submit. The board may prescribe rules of procedure to implement the provisions of this plan relating to the conduct of disability hearings. The board will conduct a preliminary determination as to whether the member is permanently and totally disabled based upon the written documentation presented. If the board does not grant the application based on the written documentation, it will inform the member in writing of the reasons for the denial of the application. The member may, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the board's preliminary denial, request a full evidentiary hearing before the board. Said hearing will be conducted consistent with the principles of due process and the rules of evidence generally applicable to administrative proceedings will apply. The board will have the power to issue subpoenas compelling the attendance of witnesses. At said hearing the applicant may present such oral and written evidence as the applicant deems necessary to establish its burden of proof. The board may appoint special counsel as an advocate to cross-examine witnesses and to offer argument in opposition to the application. The attorney for the board will not serve both as advocate and as advisor to the board in the same proceeding. The applicant and the board will have the right to examine and cross-examine all witnesses. The decision of the board will be based solely upon the evidence presented and the law applicable to this plan. Following the conclusion of the hearing, the board will render an opinion in writing setting forth the reasons for the grant or denial of the benefit. In the event that the disability benefit is denied, the applicant will have the right to judicial review by complaint for common law certiorari in the Circuit Court of Broward County. 
(4)  Non-admissible causes of disability. No member will be granted a disability retirement upon a determination by the board of trustees for a disability that resulted from: 
(a)  Excessive and habitual use of drugs, intoxicants or narcotics; 
(b)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots, civil insurrections or while committing a crime; 
(c)  Injury or disease sustained by the member diagnosed or discovered subsequent to the date employment has terminated; 
(d)  Injury or disease sustained by the member after commencing employment with the city and while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment; 
(e)  Injury or disease sustained by the member while serving in any armed forces; 
(f)  Injury or disease sustained by the member as a result of an act of war, whether or not such act arises from a formerly declared state of war; 
(g)  Pre-existing medical condition. 
(5)  Disability retirement income. 
(a)  Service-connected disability. A monthly benefit equal to the greater of the member's monthly accrued benefit as described under section 13.5-51 or fifty (50) per cent of the member's final average monthly compensation as of date of termination of service. 
(b)  Nonservice-connected disability. A monthly benefit equal to the greater of the member's monthly accrued benefit as described under section 13.5-51 or twenty-five (25) per cent of the members final average monthly compensation as of date of termination of service. 
(6)  Payment of disability retirement income. Upon approval by the board of trustees, disability retirement benefits will be payable on the first day of each month commencing on the fast day of the month coincident with, or next following, the later to occur on (a) the date on which the disability has existed for five (5) months; or (b) the date upon which the member has made written application to the board for disability benefits. Disability retirement income will continue until the death of the member or recovery from disability. Upon attaining what would have been the member's normal retirement date, the member shall have an option to convert the disability retirement to a service retirement. The member shall receive credited service for each year in which the member was in disability status but final average monthly compensation for calculation purposes shall be based on the member's salary as of the time the disability benefit was granted. The election to convert the retirement must be made within 60 days after notification by the board of the election option. Recovery from disability retirement will be determined by the board under the provisions of subsection (7) below. In the event of death of a disabled member, any benefits payable on behalf of such member will be subject to the provisions of subsection (9) of this section. 
(7)  Recovery from disability. The board of trustees will have the continuing right to require disabled members to submit to a medical examination to determine that the member remains disabled. In order for a member to be deemed recovered, the medical board must recommend to the board that he or she has sufficiently recovered to again engage in the duties of a police officer or general employee and the city has certified that it has a position within the workforce available for the member consistent with his or her medical condition. Upon the board's determination that a member is no longer eligible for disability retirement from the plan, the monthly disability benefit payments will cease. 
(8)  Reemployment after recovery of a disabled retiree. Upon finding that a member is no longer disabled, he or she may return to work for the city at the same rank and position previously occupied and shall be placed into the appropriate step in the pay plan which the member would have occupied if he or she had not become disabled. The member shall again become an active member of the plan but will receive no credited service for any period of time in which he or she was receiving disability benefits. If the member declines reemployment within the city, he or she will be deemed to have terminated employment on the date that the disability benefit commenced. 
(9)  Death of a disabled retiree. In the event of the death of a member who is retired due to disability under the plan and who has not received disability retirement benefits for a period of ten (10) years, the member's monthly disability retirement benefits will continue to be paid to the member's beneficiary until a combined total of one hundred twenty (120) payments have been made to the disabled retiree and his or her beneficiary. In the event there is no designated beneficiary, the remaining unpaid benefit shall be paid to the estate of the deceased member. 
(Ord. No. 782, 8-25-98) 
Sec. 13.5-57. - Termination of service. 
(1)  In the event of termination of a member's service with the city for any reasons other than normal, delayed or early retirement as described under subsections 13.5-55(1), (2) and (3) respectively, disability retirement under section 13.5-56 or death under section 13.5-59, any benefits payable to the terminated member will be as provided in subsections 13.5-57(2) and 13.5-57(3) below. 
(2)  Termination after completion of five (5) years of credited service. After completion of five (5) years of credited service, the terminated member will be entitled to a deferred vested benefit commencing on his or her normal retirement date, if living at such time. The deferred vested benefit will be calculated based upon the member's accrued benefit as described under section 13.5-51, determined as of date of termination of service with the city, multiplied by the member's vesting percentage, as described under section 13.5-51. The deferred vested benefit will be payable to the member as of his or her normal retirement date, under the normal form of payment, or; if the member has earned the credited service requirement for early retirement as described under section 13.5-51, he or she may elect to receive a benefit commencing at an early retirement date, upon reaching the age requirement of that section, in lieu of benefits payable at normal retirement date. In the event the member elects to receive early retirement benefits, the vested accrued benefit will be reduced to reflect early retirement as described under subsection 13.5-55(3)(b). 
    Any terminated member may elect to receive a return of his or her accumulated contributions, as described under subsection 13.5-54(4), in lieu of receiving any other benefits from the plan. A terminated member who elects a lump sum return of contributions releases and discharges the City of Wilton Manors and the retirement plan from the right to any other benefit from the plan. 
(3)  Termination prior to completion of five (5) years of credited service. Any member who has accrued less than five (5) years of credited service as of date of termination of service with the city will be entitled only to his or her accumulated contributions as described under subsection 13.5-54(4). A terminated member who elects a lump sum return of contributions releases and discharges the city and the retirement plan from the right to any other benefit from the plan. 
(Ord. No. 782, 8-25-98) 
Sec. 13.5-58. - Reemployment. 
(1)  Reemployment prior to receiving accumulated contributions from the plan. In the event of reemployment with the city of a former member prior to his or her retirement and prior to receiving payment for his or her accumulated contributions as described under subsection 13.5-54(4), such member will have the credited service accrued as of date of termination restored under the plan, in lieu of receiving benefits to which he or she was entitled under 13.5-57. 
(2)  Reemployment after receiving accumulated contributions from the plan. If a former member is reemployed with the city prior to retirement and after receiving payment for his or her accumulated contributions, such member will be treated as a new employee and his or her credited service as of date of termination will not be restored. However, such member may repay to the plan the amount of accumulated contributions received plus interest on such amount from the date of payment to the date of repayment at a rate equal to the assumed rate of interest earned by the plan, in which event, his or her prior credited service will be restored. 
(3)  Reemployment after retirement. In the event of reemployment of a member as a full-time employee who has been receiving retirement benefits from the plan under the provisions of section 13.5-55, the monthly retirement benefit payments will cease upon reemployment with the city and the member will become an active member of the plan. Upon his or her subsequent termination of service, the benefit payments will again commence, except such benefits will be adjusted to reflect the payments previously received and any benefits subsequently earned. 
(4)  Reemployment after receiving disability retirement income. In the event of reemployment of a member as a full-time employee who was receiving a disability retirement income from the plan, the provisions of subsections 13.5-56(7) and 13.5-56(8) will be applicable to such member. 
(5)  Reemployment after absence due to compulsory military service. The board of trustees will determine and credit to a member, if applicable, additional credited service, or make any other adjustment necessary to provide the member with the benefit accrual credit to which he is entitled under law, including the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), for his or her period of military service. 
(Ord. No. 782, 8-25-98) 
Sec. 13.5-59. - Death benefits. 
(1)  Death of an active member. In the event of the death of an active member prior to retirement, the member's beneficiary will be entitled to a death benefit which can be provided by the greater of the member's accumulated contributions as described under subsection 13.5-54(4) or the actuarial equivalent present value of the member's vested accrued benefit as described under section 13.5-51, calculated as of the member's date of death. 
(2)  Death of a terminated member prior to receipt of benefits. In the event of the death of a terminated member who had a vested percentage greater than zero (0) per cent as of date of termination and who has not commenced receiving retirement benefits under the provisions of section 13.5-55 or 13.5-56, such member's beneficiary will be entitled to a death benefit which can be provided by the greater of the member's accumulated contributions as described under section 13.5-54(4) or the actuarial equivalent present value of the member's vested accrued benefit determined as of the date of death, as described under sections 13.5-51. 
    In the event of the death of a terminated member prior to receiving any benefits from the plan and who had a vesting percentage of zero (0) per cent as of date of termination, the beneficiary of such member will be entitled only to an amount equal to the member's accumulated contributions as described under section 13.5-54(4). 
(3)  Death of a disabled retiree. Any benefits payable to a beneficiary due to the death of a member who is receiving disability retirement benefits from the plan, will be payable in accordance with the provisions of 13.5-56. 
(4)  Payment of death benefits. Death benefits will be payable to a beneficiary under the normal form of payment, commencing on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the member's death. In lieu of death benefits under subsections 13.5-59(1) and 13.5-59(2) above being paid as a monthly life annuity, the single-sum value of such benefits may be paid to the beneficiary, or the actuarial equivalent amount under another form of payment, at the discretion of the board of trustees. 
(Ord. No. 782, 8-25-98) 
Sec. 13.5-60. - Compliance with the Internal Revenue Code. 
(1)  Qualification. It is the intention of the city and of the board of trustees that the plan remain at all times a qualified plan as that term is defined under the Internal Revenue Code.

(2)  Internal Revenue Code Section 415-Benefit Limitations. No member may receive a benefit which exceeds limits established by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(3)  Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9) - Distribution Requirements. When a distribution of the member's entire interest is not made in a lump sum, the distribution will be made as follows: over the life of the member; over the life of the member and his or her beneficiary; over a period certain not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member; or over a period certain not extending beyond the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the member and his or her beneficiary. 
    If the distribution has commenced before the member's death, upon death of the member, the remaining interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of the member's death. 
    The method of distribution, if the participant dies before distribution is commenced, must satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  Any remaining portion of the member's interest that is not payable to a beneficiary designated by the member will be distributed within five (5) years after the member's death;

    In no event may the payment for a member's retirement benefit commence later than the April 1st of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the April 1st following the calendar year in which the member retires. 
(4)  Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17)-Annual Compensation Limits. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, a member's annual compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code will be disregarded. However, for those members who commenced participation in the plan prior to the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995, the limitation on compensation will not be less than the amount that was allowed to be taken into account under the plan as in effect on July 1, 1993. 
(Ord. No. 782, 8-25-98) 
Sec. 13.5-61. - Qualified domestic relations orders. 
    In the event that the board of trustees is served with a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) or other legal process purporting to require the payment of any portion of a member's benefit to another person as a result of a dissolution of marriage, the board shall cause such order to be reviewed to determine compliance with the provisions of the plan. 
    The board shall be authorized to intervene in any such dissolution of marriage proceeding to ensure that such is otherwise consistent with the distribution of an interest in a public employees retirement plan under state law. 
    Any cost associated with the modification or correction of such QDRO shall be the responsibility of the plan member. 
(Ord. No. 782, 8-25-98) 
Sec. 13.5-62. - Miscellaneous. 
(1)  Benefits not assignable. The present or future right of a person to money in the trust fund or to a retirement allowance, an optional allowance, a death benefit, the return of contributions, or any other right accrued or accruing under the provisions of this plan shall not be assignable and shall not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or insolvency law or any other process of law whatsoever, except with respect to alimony, child support or medical payments to a former spouse, as provided under section 13.5-61.

No member of the plan will be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from another retirement system or plan; provided that this restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under 10 USC Chapter 67. 
(4)  Written notice of denial of claims. There will be timely adequate written notice given to any member or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the provisions of the plan has been denied. This notice should set forth the specific reasons for such denial. There will be a full and fair review in such cases when a member or beneficiary has had his or her claim to benefits denied. 
(5)  Applicable law. The plan will be construed, interpreted and enforced according to the laws of the state and all provisions of the plan will be administered according to those laws. 
    The board shall have the power to examine into the facts upon which any pension has been granted under any prior or existing law or which may be granted in the future or obtained erroneously, fraudulently, or illegally for any reason. The board is empowered to purge the pension rolls of any person who has been granted a pension under a prior or existing law, or who is hereafter granted a benefit under the plan if the granting of that pension is found to be erroneous, fraudulent, or illegal for any reason; and to reclassify any pensioner who has under any prior or existing law or who may under the plan be erroneously, improperly or illegally classified. 
(6)  Errors. Should any change or error in the plan records be discovered or result in any member or beneficiary receiving from the plan more or less than he or she would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, the board shall have the power to correct such error and, as far as possible, adjust the payments in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of a benefit to which such member or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid. 
(7)  Early retirement. Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, any member who, as of passage of the ordinance from which this section derives (Jan. 26, 1999), has completed at least seventeen (17) years of credited service in the plan, who is at least fifty (50) years of age, and whose position is eliminated by the city commission shall be eligible to participate in the early retirement incentive program. Any member making an irrevocable election to retire under this program shall be granted additional years of credit service to permit the member making this election to receive a 20-year benefit under the plan. In no event shall any member exercising this early retirement incentive be granted additional years of credited service in excess of three (3) years. The retirement board shall determine the actuarial cost of this benefit, which cost shall be paid by the city as part of its contribution to the retirement plan. There shall be no additional required employee contribution for this benefit. This early retirement incentive shall be open to all eligible members for thirty (30) days from the date of passage. Failure to apply for early retirement within the thirty (30) day window created hereunder, shall constitute a permanent waiver of the right to participate in this early retirement incentive program. Any member who exercises this option within the thirty (30) day window provided herein, must separate from city service not more than one hundred eighty (180) days after making such election. The retirement board shall establish, by uniform rule, any forms or procedures necessary to implement this provision. This section shall be deemed automatically repealed thirty (30) days after its passage. 
(8)  Purchase of prior non-contributing city service. 
(a)  Election to purchase prior non-contributing service. All active members of the plan shall be permitted to purchase the initial six (6) months of non-contributing service with the city, as credited service in the plan. The Board, acting in concert with its actuary, shall advise all active members of the amount of non-contributing service available to be purchased and the employee cost to purchase the service, as applicable. Once provided with the calculations by the plan's actuary, members shall have ninety (90) days to elect to purchase their non-contributing service. 
(b)  Payment for purchased service. Payment to the plan may be made through pre-tax payroll deductions, by check, or, by rollover from another qualified plan. The maximum permissible time available for payment for non-contributing service shall not exceed the initial six (6) months of the probationary period. An employee making payroll deductions shall complete all required installments prior to payment of any benefit under this section. If installment payments are not completed at the time an employee retires, the employee shall not receive credit for the remaining period for which payments were not made. An employee making installment payments shall pay an interest rate as established by a uniform rule of the board.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 789, § 2, adopted Jan. 26, 1999, added new provisions to Ord. No. 782 as 21.9(g); said provisions have been codified, at the editor's discretion, as subsection 13.5-62(7). The user's attention is directed to the definition "Early retirement" in section 13.5-51. In the event of conflict between subsection 13.5-62(7) and the definition of "Early retirement," it is presumed the more recent provisions will prevail. 
Cross reference- Early retirement defined, § 13.5-51. 
Sec. 13.5-63. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions. 
(1)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. 
    Eligible rollover distribution shall mean an eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series' of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income. 
    Eligible retirement plan shall mean an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, and annuity plan described in 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. 
    Distributee shall mean a distributee includes a member and a member's surviving spouse, a beneficiary or beneficiaries. 
    Direct rollover shall mean a direct rollover is payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.

Sec. 13.5-64. - Amendment of plan. 
    The plan may be amended by the city from time to time by resolution of the city commission specifying such amendment. The city may amend the plan by altering or modifying the provisions provided, however, no such amendment, modification or alteration shall be made which shall divert any part of the corpus or income of the trust fund to any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of the members or beneficiaries; provided, further, no such alteration, amendment, or modification shall deprive a member of any accrued benefit which has vested at the time the amendment is adopted or the date such amendment becomes effective, whichever is later. An amendment may be made retroactive if, in the judgment of the board, it is advisable or necessary in order for the plan to remain as tax exempt under any federal or state law. 
(Ord. No. 782, 8-25-98; Ord. No. 848, 10-14-03) 
Sec. 13.5-65. - Termination of the plan. 
    It is the intention of the city and the board of directors that this plan shall constitute an irrevocable trust and no portion of the assets may revert to the city or the state until all other obligations of the plan, including the payment to the last surviving member and beneficiary, have been paid. 
    In the event of termination or partial termination of the plan, each member's accrued benefit shall become nonforfeitable (100 per cent vested) to the extent funded. At such time, the funds shall be appropriated and distributed in accordance with the provisions of F.S. Ch. 185. 
    In the event that the plan is terminated, the assets of the plan shall first be distributed to retired members and their beneficiaries. If there is any asset value remaining after the apportionment to retired members and their beneficiaries, apportionment shall next be made to each member in the service of the city who has completed at least five years of credited service and has contributed to the fund for at least five years and who is not otherwise eligible to retire. If there is any asset value after the apportionments to retired members, beneficiaries and to members with five years of credited service, apportionments will be made to all remaining members of the plan in an amount not to exceed the total value of the member' s accumulated contributions. In the event that there is any asset value remaining after full apportionment to all members and beneficiaries of the plan, the excess, if any, shall revert proportionately to the city and the state on the basis of contributions to the plan. 
(Ord. No. 782, 8-25-98) 
Sec. 13.5-66. - Deferred retirement option plan. 
(a)  A deferred retirement option plan (DROP) has been created for the plan. 
(b)  Eligibility to participate in the DROP is based upon the member's completion of twenty (20) years of credited service. 
(c)  The maximum period of DROP participation is six (6) years. Existing DROP participants shall be covered by the six (6) year maximum participation period described below in subsection (d). 
(d)  In order to participate for the full six (6) years in the DROP, entry into the program must commence not later than the first day of the month following the member's completion of twenty (20) years of credited service. DROP participation eligibility shall be reduced by one (1) month for each month following the completion of twenty (20) years of credited service. For a period of ninety (90) days following the adoption of the ordinance from which this article derives, members who have completed twenty (20) years of credited service shall have the option to elect DROP participation. If that election is made within the ninety (90) day period, these members shall be granted a full six (6) years of DROP participation. Members who, as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives, have already completed twenty (20) years of credited service and who do not elect participation within the ninety (90) day window provided in this section shall only be granted DROP eligibility for the number of months remaining between the first day of the month following the completion of twenty (20) years of credited service and the maximum DROP participation period. 
(e)  Upon entry into the DROP, the member's final average monthly compensation and accrued benefit shall be calculated. No change in the plan benefits made subsequent to entry into the DROP shall apply to the member unless otherwise applicable to retired members. 
(f)  Payment shall be made into the employee's DROP account as if the employees had terminated employment in the city in an amount determined by the employee's selection of the payment option. 
(g)  An employee's account in the DROP program shall earn or lose interest based upon the actual earnings of the plan for the preceding year. 
(h)  An employee shall terminate service with the city at the conclusion of the established period of DROP participation for the member under the provisions of subsection (d) above. 
(i)  All interest shall be credited to the employee's DROP account at the end of the DROP period. 
(j)  Upon termination with the city, an employee may receive payment within forty-five (45) days of the member requesting payment or may defer payment until a time not later than the latest date authorized by section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code at the option of the member. 
(k)  Payments from the DROP may be received as a lump sum, paid directly to the participant or paid as an eligible rollover; provided, however, that at all times, the DROP shall be subject to the minimum distribution provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(l)  No payment may be made from the DROP until the employee actually separates for service with the city. 
(m)  If an employee shall die during participation in the DROP, the employee shall be treated as any other vested member in the plan who dies prior to retirement. 
(n)  Upon commencement of participation in the DROP, the member shall no longer be eligible for disability retirement from the plan. If a member becomes disabled during the DROP period, the member shall be treated as if he/she retired on the day prior to the date of disability.

    In addition to the monthly retirement benefits provided by this plan, effective October 1, 2003, all employees retiring as members of this plan shall be entitled to receive a monthly supplemental payment at the rate of ten dollars ($10.00) for each year of credited service, which shall not exceed two hundred dollars ($200.00) per month. This benefit shall commence on the first day of the month following separation from service, providing the member is retired and receiving an early, normal or disability pension. The post retirement supplement shall not be paid to terminated vested members or to members who retired prior to the effective date of this section. Current DROP participants shall be eligible to receive payment of the post retirement supplement. The post retirement supplement shall not be paid to any DROP participants while actively employed by the city. The board, by uniform rule, shall establish a procedure for the distribution of this benefit. This benefit shall be limited solely to persons employed by the city and participating in the plan on or before September 30, 2005. The board, by uniform administrative rule, shall have the authority to establish the distribution of this benefit on a tax favored basis, consistent with the Internal Revenue Code.

The COLA will apply to police personnel who are in the DROP Plan prior to the effective date of the 2002-2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement, and police personnel who retire or enter the DROP Plan during the term of the 2002-2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement. The annual cost of living pension benefit adjustment will be three (3) per cent annually and shall begin after the:

(b)  Sixth (6th) anniversary of their retirement if they retire during the 2nd year of the 2002-2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement; or 
(c)  Fifth (5th) anniversary of their retirement if they retire during the 3rd year of the 2002-2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement. 
    The COLA shall not apply to police personnel retiring or entering into the DROP after the expiration of the 2002-2005 PBA Collective Bargaining Agreement. This section 13.5-70 shall expire after September 30, 2005, provided that the rights of any persons accruing under this section prior to its expiration shall be preserved. The COLA shall not apply to any other members other than the police personnel described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, police personnel who have a minimum of ten (10) years of credited service (as defined in section 13.5-51 of the City Code) with the city as of October 31, 2006 and who hereafter enter into the DROP or otherwise retire from the city shall receive an annual retirement cost of living adjustment of three (3) per cent commencing on October 1 after the eligible participant's sixth (6th) anniversary of their actual retirement date. Notwithstanding the commencement date of the annual retirement cost of living adjustment, the annual retirement cost of living adjustment shall be calculated as of the eligible participant's sixth (6th) anniversary of their actual retirement date and be prorated.

Sec. 13.5-83. - Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(a)  Normal retirement. 
(1)  Normal retirement date. The normal retirement date for a member shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the attainment of the earlier of: (i) the member's fifty-fifth (55th) birthday; or (ii) the member's fiftieth (50th) birthday and the completion of twenty (20) years of continuous membership as an active member of the Wilton Manors volunteer fire department. A member will be one hundred (100) percent vested upon the attainment of his normal retirement date regardless of any other provision of the system. 
(2)  Normal retirement benefit. 
a.  Normal form of benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his normal retirement date shall receive his monthly normal retirement benefit commencing on his normal retirement date and continuing thereafter for life. There shall be no minimum guaranteed benefit. The normal form of retirement benefit shall be an unreduced life benefit with one hundred twenty (120) guaranteed payments. If the member shall die prior to receiving one hundred twenty (120) payments, the remaining benefits shall be paid to the beneficiary designated by the member. In the event that no beneficiary has been designated, the member's estate shall be the recipient of the remaining balance of payments. 
b.  Amount. A member's normal monthly retirement benefit shall be fifty-six dollars ($56.00) for each year of active membership in the Wilton Manors Volunteer Fire Department, payable as a monthly benefit. The normal retirement benefit shall include all creditable service accrued by a member prior to the effective date of this article. In the event that increased city contributions are required to maintain the current level of benefits, the city may reduce future benefits prospectively to reduce contributions so that the state premium tax monies will be sufficient to cover the actuarial cost of the plan benefits. However, nothing herein shall provide for the reduction of accrued benefits. 
c.  Optional forms of payment. In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal retirement, early retirement, or termination of service, upon written request to the board of trustees and submission of evidence of good health (except that such evidence will not be required if such request is made at least one (1) year prior to the date of commencement of retirement income), and subject to the approval of the board of trustees, the participant may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
1.  Option 1: Joint and survivor option. A reduced optional retirement income continuing during the lifetime of the retired participant, and further continuing after his death at fifty (50), sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ), seventy-five (75) or one hundred (100) percent (according to the election of the participant) of the reduced optional retirement income, to his designated joint annuitant, during the lifetime of such joint annuitant after the death of the participant; 
2.  Option 2: Period certain and life option. Actuarial equivalent optional retirement income, payable during the lifetime of the retired participant and guaranteed to continue to the participant, to a designated beneficiary, or to the estate of the last to die of the participants and the beneficiary, for at least ten (10) years, regardless of whether or not the participant survives such ten-year period; provided that any payments becoming due to the estate of any person may be computed and paid in one (1) sum at the discretion of the board of trustees, and provided that the period certain may not exceed the complete life expectancy of a participant at retirement; or 
3.  Option 3. Such other amount and form of retirement payments of benefits as, in the opinion of the board of trustees, will best meet the circumstances of the participant. 
(3)  Delayed payment. A member retiring on his normal retirement date may request, by submitting his written application to the board, that the commencement of his monthly normal retirement benefit payments be delayed until a date which is the first day of any future month, but not later than April 1 of the calendar year following the member's attainment of age seventy and one-half (70-1/2), at which time benefit payments must commence in accordance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder. If the commencement of the payment of a member's monthly normal retirement benefit is delayed to a future date as provided in this section, the monthly benefit of such future date shall be the amount of the member's monthly normal retirement benefit actuarially adjusted to reflect the member's age as of such designated date. 
(b)  Deferred retirement. 
(1)  Approval and conditions for deferred retirement. A member who is eligible for normal retirement may elect to continue his membership in the volunteer fire department beyond his normal retirement date by submitting his written notice to the board. 
(2)  Deferred retirement benefit. The amount of the monthly deferred retirement benefit payable to a member as of the deferred retirement date shall be calculated in the same manner as his normal retirement benefit. 
(c)  Disability benefits. 
(1)  Service-connected disability. 
a.  Amount. A member who incurs a service-connected injury, disease, or disability, which injury, disease or disability permanently incapacitates the member, physically or mentally, from regular and continuous duty as a volunteer firefighter shall receive in equal monthly installments disability benefits in an amount equal to the normal retirement benefit which would have been paid at the member's normal retirement date. It is the intent of this provision that a service-connected disability benefit be tax exempt under the provisions of Section 104 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
b.  Normal form of disability benefit. A normal form of disability benefit payable hereunder shall be an annuity payable for life. 
c.  Optional forms of disability benefits. Disability retirees shall be permitted to select any of the optional forms of payment available under subsection 3(a)(2)(c) above. The actuarial factors to be used in computing the reduced disability retirement income shall be the reduction factors adopted and used by the state department of insurance in the administration of F.S. Ch. 175. 
(2)  Determination of disability. All issues and determinations relating to eligibility for disability benefits shall be determined by the board, taking into consideration the recommendations of the medical board, and based upon the methods and procedures established by the board. The determination by the board shall be conclusive as to all issues pertaining to disability. All such determinations shall be applied uniformly and consistently to all members in similar circumstances. 
(3)  No reduction for other disability benefits. The benefit provided in this section shall not be subject to offset by Social Security, workers' compensation or any other form of disability benefit. 
(4)  Credited service while disabled. A disabled member's period of service-connected disability shall be credited to him as continuous service upon his recovery, provided he immediately returns thereafter as an active member of the volunteer fire department. 
(d)  Pre-retirement death benefit. 
(1)  Service-connected death. A death benefit shall be payable commencing in the month following death on behalf of any member who, prior to the commencement of termination, disability or retirement benefit payments under this system, dies as a direct result of a service-connected death. In such circumstance, the designated beneficiary of the member shall receive the member's normal retirement benefit as if the member had retired on the date of death. If no beneficiary be designated, then payment shall be made to the member's surviving spouse, if any; and if none, to the member's surviving children, in equal shares; and if none, to the member's estate. 
(e)  Termination benefits and vesting. If a member ceases to be a volunteer firefighter as defined in this article, the member shall be entitled to receive the following termination benefits: 
(1)  With less than ten (10) years of continuous service, the member shall not be entitled to any benefits under this system. 
(2)  Upon the completion of ten (10) years of active membership in the volunteer fire department, a member shall be considered one hundred (100) percent vested in the system. No benefit shall be payable before the normal retirement date, except as otherwise expressly provided in this plan. 
(f)  Overall limitation on amount of benefits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, and in addition to any other limitations set forth in the system, shall not exceed the maximum amounts permitted under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code.

(b)  Member contributions. There shall be no member contributions to the retirement system. 
(c)  City contributions. The city shall contribute on an annual basis an amount which is equal the difference between the normal cost for the year, as determined by the most recent actuarial valuation of the liabilities of the system, and the premium tax refund monies received from the State of Florida on behalf of the firefighters. The city shall also contribute to the fund, in addition to the amounts provided above, such amounts as shall be necessary to amortize any prior service liability over a period not to exceed thirty (30) years. All city contributions shall be made on a quarterly basis. Nothing in this article shall prohibit the city from altering or reducing prospective plan benefits, should the chapter monies be insufficient to continue to provide the current level of benefits provided in this article. However, nothing herein shall provide for the reduction of accrued benefits.

Recovered materials, as described above, are not solid waste and are limited to those materials defined below as recyclable material.

A franchise is nonexclusive, and will not expressly or implicitly preclude the issuance of other franchises within the city, or affect the city's right to authorize other persons to collect recovered materials for the purpose of recycling in the city. The failure of the city, upon one (1) or more occasions, to exercise a right or to require compliance or performance under this division shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of such right or a waiver of compliance or performance.

(h)  The city may grant an initial or renewal franchise for a period not to exceed three (3) years to serve all or a specified area of the city. In evaluating an application for a franchise, the city may consider, among other things, the applicant's technical, financial, and legal qualifications to operate the proposed solid waste recycling service.

In addition, it is the responsibility of the franchisee to notify the city of any threatened or actual violation of any other regulatory agency or board, whether federal, state, or county, or any administrative agency thereto.

(b)  The franchisee shall have three (3) calendar days from receipt of any notice to correct the violation or to provide a cure to same. Should the violation not have been corrected to the satisfaction of the code enforcement officer, then, in that event, the code enforcement board shall conduct a special administrative hearing to be held within five (5) calendar days subsequent to the expiration of the three-day notice provided for herein.

Otherwise, the hearing shall be held as to the violation or violations and relevant evidence pertaining to the violation and its correction shall be heard.

(3)  A system may be used, which may be mechanical in nature, requiring a monetary deposit which is of a reasonable amount such that it does not deter usage of the cart but encourages return of the cart and allows for a refund of the deposit; or 
(4)  A shopping cart wheel locking system may be used in conjunction with an electronic barrier along the perimeter of the business establishment premises; such a system causes the shopping cart wheels to lock when the cart approaches or crosses the barrier location by activating the electronic barrier. 
(d)  Any business establishment that does not provide one (1) of the foregoing systems or methods shall be afforded a period of six (6) months form the effective date of this section within which to comply. 
(e)  The owner or operator of any business establishment who or which fails to provide and maintain an on-site shopping cart retention system shall be in violation of this section.

(Ord. No. 727, § 2, 6-14-94) 
Sec. 20-2. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. Words and terms used in this chapter that are not included in this section shall be interpreted in accordance with standard reference books, such as dictionaries and engineering texts and technical papers, as expanded by accepted local usage. In the event of a conflict between any portion of a definition in this section and any other reference, the definition herein shall govern insofar as interpretations and applications of the provisions of this chapter are concerned. 
    BOD: Biochemical oxygen demand of a liquid sample. The BOD of the sample is the concentration, in parts per million, of oxygen which will be utilized in the biochemical oxidation of organic matter in the sample, when subjected to a standard laboratory procedure test for five (5) days at a temperature of two hundred (200) degrees C. 
    Business unit: If a customer or one (1) of his renters or lessees offers to the public one (1) or more physically separated, identifiable non-dwelling unit services, then each such separate service shall be considered a separate business unit. 
    City: City of Wilton Manors, Broward County, Florida. 
    Commercial, multi-family, or business customer: A customer that is neither a residential customer nor an industrial customer, or which has more than one (1) domestic usage meter servicing a single-family unit. 
    Connection charge: A charge which a developer is required to pay for the privilege of connecting to an overall city utility system. There may be a separate connection charge for each system, as described in the appropriate article of this chapter. The connection charge is a reimbursement to the city of the developer's share of the costs incurred by the city in providing the major portions of the overall system, as identified by a water and/or sewer capacity study. Connection charges shall be paid at the time a property first connects to the city's utility systems. In most cases, these will be one-time charges. However, if a property owner subsequently applies for a building permit for new or revised construction on his property, there may be additional connection charges associated with the additional impact on the utility. At the time of application for a new building permit, the city shall compute what the total connection charges would be if the revised property were applying for initial connections to the systems. If the computed charges are higher due to additional impact on the utility, then the property owner shall be required to pay new connection charges, equal to the difference. 
    Construction charge: A one-time charge which a developer might be required to pay for the privilege of connecting to a subportion of a city utility system, located between the owner's property and the portion of the system identified in a city water and/or sewer study. When required, a construction charge shall be intended as reimbursement of the developer's share of the costs of constructing the applicable subportion of the utility system. In each case, the magnitude and distribution of the construction charge shall have been previously established in one (1) or more developer's agreements between the city and a previous developer, who paid the costs of constructing the subportion. Construction charges received by the city from the future developers are used by the city to reimburse the original developer or assignee for that portion of the construction costs considered to be for oversized facilities, as defined in this section. 
    Customer: The individual or legal entity responsible for payment of the security deposit and monthly service charges. This shall be either the owner of the property or an individual or corporate entity authorized by the owner to open the utility account. 
    Developer: Owner of property or owner of a development, as defined in this section. If an agent of the owner has the full legal authority to negotiate with the city for connection to the city's utility services, then the agent shall be considered as the developer. 
    Developer's agreement: A written agreement entered into between the city and a developer pursuant to applicable law if funding the construction of some of the mains of a utility service to serve a development entails the use of special procedures. If used, it shall be negotiated between the developer and the city manager, or his representative, and shall be accepted by the city by resolution of the city commission. As a minimum, a developer's agreement shall be required whenever all of the following conditions apply: 
(1)  The development cannot proceed unless construction of new mains for a public utility system has been provided for to the satisfaction of city. 
(2)  The developer is to contribute some or all of the cost of the construction of those mains, either by the developer constructing them and then giving title to the city, or by paying some or all of the construction costs incurred by others. 
(3)  The mains being constructed: 
a.  Either are in a portion of the system identified in a water and/or sewer study, and the value of the developer's contribution to construction costs will be larger than the required connection charge; 
b.  Or include one (1) or more oversized facilities in a subportion of the utility system to be situated between the individual lots of the development and the portion of the system identified in the water and/or sewer study. 
(4)  The city has determined that future developments will benefit from the current construction and, because of the current developer's excess contribution, he will be entitled to some reimbursement from the future developments, either from their required connection charges or from special construction charges established in the developer's agreement. 
    Development: A parcel of land, regardless of size or location, which is proposed for improvements to the extent that utility services will be required, and for which one (1) or more of the proposed lots will not be able to receive adequate utility service unless one (1) or more new utility mains or service laterals are constructed. Development includes those improvements to land for which a certificate of occupancy has not yet been issued or a final inspection has not been received, and where the proposed or approved improvement impacts the capacity of the city's water or sewer system. 
    Domestic usage meter: A water service meter primarily used for billing water for potable and household purposes. 
    Dwelling unit: See Article 10 of the City of Wilton Manors, Florida, Unified Land Development Regulations.

Wherever possible there should be two (2) or more primary feeders from a point of supply which may be tapped with a line size capable of delivering the fire flow needed to that specific area of the city wherein the outlet is located. The magnitudes required for an adequate capability are dependent upon many factors. It is the intention that the city's water distribution system be capable of delivering a fire flow equal to the flow calculated in accordance with the "fire suppression rating schedule" by the insurance service office in effect at the time of installation. 
    Fixture unit: A measure of the instantaneous rate of flow normally required by a particular type of plumbing fixture. The sum of the fixture units of all plumbing fixtures in a building is a measure of the total water used by that building. From time to time, the city will analyze available consumption data and establish a list of fixture unit values for various types of plumbing fixtures. The current values authorized for use in connection with this chapter are: 
Type Fixture Fixture Units Bathtub (with or without Overhead shower) 2 Bathtub (whirlpool) 2 Bidet 1 Dental unit or cuspidor 1 Dental lavatory 1 Drinking fountain 1/2 Dishwasher domestic 2 Floor drains 3 Lavatory Small 1 Lavatory Large 2 Lavatory, barber, beauty parlor 2 Lavatory, surgeon's 2 Laundry tray (1 or 2 compartments) 2 Shower stall, domestic 2 Showers (group) per head 2 Sinks 3 Combination sink-and-tray 3 Combination sink-and-tray with food disposal unit 3 Kitchen sink, domestic 2 Kitchen sink, domestic with food waste grinder and/or dishwasher 2 Surgeon's sink 3 Flushing rim sink (with valve) 8 Service sinks, combination trap standard 3 Service sink (P Trap) Ordinary 2 Pot. scullery, etc., sink 4 Wash sink (circular or multiple) each set of faucets 1 Urinal, pedestal 8 Urinal, wall 4 Urinal stall, washout 4 Water closet, tank operated 4 Water closet, valve-operated 8 Automatic dishwasher (domestic) 2 Automatic clothes washer 4 Commercial dishwasher 6 Commercial clothes washer 6

If the city authorizes a developer to construct a service connection, then acceptance by the city of the completed work shall constitute payment in full of the meter charge, without regard to the magnitude of actual costs incurred by the developer or published schedules of charges. 
    Multi-family residential unit: A residential customer that pays a single monthly service charge, but where utilities are provided to two (2) or more residential dwelling units. 
    Oversized facility. A pipe or pumping facility which satisfies all of the following: 
(1)  It is constructed in order to serve a development and is located in a subportion of a city utility system which connects the individual lots of the development to a portion of the system indicated in the water and/or sewer study. 
(2)  The developer has contributed to its construction, either by the developer constructing or by making total or partial reimbursement of the costs of construction by others. 
(3)  The city has determined that adequate service to future nearby developments will not be possible unless the current facility is constructed larger than would be required to serve only the current development. In determining the size that would be required to service only the current development, the city shall use generally accepted design criteria and shall apply all of the provisions of this chapter, such as required minimums, looped distribution mains, fire flows, and the like. 
    pH: A number, determined by standard laboratory test, which serves as a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a liquid. 
    Plan review charges. For purposes of this chapter, plan review charges are charges paid by a developer to defray costs incurred by the city in reviewing utility plans submitted by the developer. Construction plans for all water and/or sewer facilities to be constructed by the developer between the service connections of the developer's individual lots and the existing city water and/or sewer mains must be submitted with the application for connection to the city's utility systems. At that time, the developer shall pay a plan review charge as provided in Resolution No. 2600, as amended from time to time, as the developer's share of all "normal" plan review costs incurred by the city. "Normal" plan review costs are defined to be all costs associated with: presubmittal meetings with the city staff and the engineer, the first review of the final plans submitted with the application, the preparation of a letter to the developer itemizing any required plan modifications identified in the first review, and the inspection of a first resubmittal, to verify that the previously identified modifications have been made. "Abnormal" review costs are defined to be any and all review costs that are incurred by the city subsequent to a determination that the first resubmittal has not complied with all requirements identified during the initial plan review. If the city incurs any abnormal plan review costs, the developer shall be required to pay an additional plan review charge in an amount equal to the one-for-one reimbursement of the actual abnormal costs incurred by the city. The additional plan review charge shall be due and payable at the time a final set of construction plans is approved.

    Sanitary sewage: That type of sewage normally originating from dwelling units. That is, sewage generated by bathrooms, preparation and serving of food for family consumption, and laundry in family-size loads. Sewage introduced into the city sewer system by a commercial or industrial customer shall be considered to be sanitary sewage only if its potential as a hazard to public health and safety or as an adverse impact upon the sewer system or the sewer treatment processes is similar to, or less severe than that caused by sewage normally originating from dwelling units. The following are some, but not necessarily all, of the criteria which shall be used in identifying sanitary sewage. If any one (1) of these criteria is exceeded, then the sewage in question automatically shall be considered as not being sanitary sewage. The potential as a hazard or adverse impact of any characteristic not listed herein shall be determined by the city on a case-by-case basis. 
Characteristics Maximum (or Minimum) For Sanitary Sewage (ppm) BOD 300 Suspended Solids 300 Grease, Fat or Oil 100 - Instantaneous 20 - Daily Average Chlorine Demand 15 Surfactants (MBAS) 2 Nitrogen, Total 35 Phosphorus, Total 10 Sulfides 0.2 Dissolved Oxygen pH (Minimum 1 ppm) PH 9.5 Maximum (5.5 Minimum) Temperature 150° F. Heavy Metals, Phenols, and Other Toxic or Poisonous Substances Zero  
    Security deposit: A deposit which must be made by each customer prior to receiving any utility service. The purpose of the deposit is to ensure payment of all monthly charges and penalties and payment of any reimbursements to the city for the cost of any repairs to city-owned property which are determined by the city to be the responsibility of the customer. Whenever any such amounts are due to the city and have not been paid within the prescribed time, the amounts due will be withdrawn from the deposit. At that time, service will be terminated until all amounts due are paid and the required deposit has been restored to the prescribed amount. 
    Service connection: A point at or near the property line at which the property owner's plumbing is connected to the city's service lateral. The term service connection also includes all city-owned fittings and appurtenances at the point of connection. A water service connection includes the city-owned meter box or vault, together with all of its contents, and any valve and valve box installed immediately adjacent to the public side of the meter box or vault. A sewer service connection includes the fitting to which the owner's plumbing is connected, the clean-out and plug, and any markings or devices installed as an aid to locating the service connection. 
    Service lateral: A pipe which connects a service connection to a water distribution main or sewer main. 
    Sewage: Liquid wastes and waterborne solid wastes originating from any customer or establishment, together with such ground water, surface water, or storm drainage as may unintentionally enter into the sewer system. 
    Sewer or sewer system: A network of gravity mains, pump stations, and force mains used to transport sewage from points of origin to a treatment/disposal plant. 
    Single-family residence: A detached single-family home. Also, each one (1) of several single-family homes which are attached to each other, or are in the same structure, but which each are billed individually for utility services. 
    SS or suspended solids: Solid particles floating or suspended in a liquid that are removable by laboratory filtration. 
    Storm drain and storm drainage system: A system of conduits, open channels and sloped ground intended to restrict and direct the flow of run-off resulting from rainfall. All run-off from any source, including building roofs and surfaces, shall be directed to a storm drain. There shall be no intentional connections between any storm drain and any sewer, and both system types shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in such a manner as to minimize the likelihood of any unintentional introduction of run-off or ground water into a sewer, and vice versa. 
    Tapping charge: A charge paid to the city by a developer as reimbursement to the city for the costs of furnishing and installing a water or sewer service lateral, and the necessary fittings and valves at the main, either at the time of initial installation or whenever a change in size or capacity is performed. If the director of public services or his or her designee authorizes a developer to construct a service lateral, then acceptance by the city of the completed work shall constitute payment in full of the tapping charge, without regard to the magnitude of actual costs incurred by the developer or published schedules of charges. 
    Water and/or sewer study or master plan: A planning document prepared by a contracted consultant and adopted by the city as a guide to expansion and maintenance of the major portions of a utility system, in order to satisfy projected future needs for service. The water and/or sewer study may be amended from time to time, the applicable water and/or sewer study being the document most recently presented to and accepted by the city commission. 
(Ord. No. 866, § 2, 10-26-04) 
Sec. 20-3. - Required connections to city utilities; policy. 
    It shall be the policy of the city that if a city utility service is available to any facility requiring that type of service, then the city utility system shall be extended to a service connection and the plumbing of the facility shall be connected to the service connection. Availability shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  Facility in existence as of time this chapter adopted. The city shall issue written notice whenever the utility does become available. Within forty-five (45) days of the date of notification, the property owner shall have entered into a contract with the city for connection to the utility. 
(2)  Developments authorized subsequent to adoption of this chapter. 
a.  If a utility main exists in any right-of-way abutting the property, then that utility shall be considered available. Prior to receipt of a permit for any construction, the developer shall have entered into a contract with the city for the connection. 
b.  Zoning, platting and development ordinances and regulations of the city and county establish criteria as to what public facilities and services must be available before a development can be constructed. If those criteria require availability of either a public water system or a public sewer system, then approval of the development by the city will be contingent upon mutual agreement between the developer and the city as to how and when the city utility system will be extended to the development. 
c.  If a development is approved without a utility being available, then the provisions of subsection (a) above shall apply to future connection of that utility. 
(Ord. No. 866, § 2, 10-26-04) 
Sec. 20-4. - Extension of city systems. 
    Requirements related to extensions of utility systems vary depending upon whether the extension (1) includes only service laterals and/or service connections, or (2) includes new mains located between one (1) or more service laterals and a portion of the system depicted in the water and/or sewer study, or (3) includes a portion of the system depicted in the water and/or sewer study. 
(1)  Service laterals and service connections. 
a.  If a main already exists in a right-of-way abutting a property line, but there is no service lateral, or a replacement lateral is necessary, then the city shall construct the service lateral and service connection, and the developer or property owner shall pay a meter charge (water only) and a tapping charge. If only a new or replacement water service connection is required, then the city shall do the work and a meter charge shall be paid. 
b.  If a new main also is required, then both the main and the service lateral shall be constructed at the same time as the new main. A water service connection may, at the discretion of the city, be constructed either at the same time as the lateral or subsequently. If either one is constructed by the developer, title to the completed product shall be transferred to the city. In that event, payment of the tapping and/or meter charge corresponding to the transferred work shall not be required and this fact shall be stated in the connection contract. The relationship between actual costs incurred by the developer and standard tapping and/or meter charges shall be immaterial, and no credits for any differences shall accrue to either the city or the developer. If either the lateral or the water service connection is constructed by the city, then the corresponding charge shall be paid by the developer. 
(2)  New mains not in water and/or sewer study. 
a.  In general, any new facilities between those depicted in a water and/or sewer study and the service laterals for a development shall be constructed by the developer, at his own expense. Drawings and specifications shall be submitted and revised and re-submitted if necessary, to the city director of public services for review, assisted as he sees fit by recommendations of the engineer. If the director of public services determines that any portion of the work must be an oversized facility, then the developer shall obtain two (2) cost estimates for the portion designated to be oversized-One (1) if built oversized and one (1) if built to the size required to serve only the development, where both sizes are as approved by the director of public services. The director of public services also shall obtain two (2) such estimates. The developer and the director of public services then shall negotiate both a contract for the utility connection, which will indicate whether the oversized facility is to be built by the developer or by the city, and a developer's agreement, which will indicate: the amount of reimbursement from future construction charges to which the developer will be entitled because of the oversizing, the specific properties that are considered to be the future beneficiaries of the oversizing, and the specific formula to be used in calculating the construction charges to be paid to the city by the owners when those properties are connected to the system. If the city is to construct the oversized facilities, the developer shall be required to fully reimburse the city for all costs actually incurred, including any costs for engineering services during design and construction. That full reimbursement shall be due and payable at the same time as payment of the required connection charge. Any reimbursements back to the developer for oversizing shall not be made until the city has received construction charges from future beneficiaries of the over-sizing, as stipulated in the developer's agreement. 
b.  If mutually agreeable, the contract for the connection might stipulate that the city shall construct not only the oversized facility but also all other new facilities needed to serve the development. In this case, the developer shall reimburse the city for all costs for design and construction of all work done by the city, but he shall not receive any subsequent reimbursement from future users for the portions not considered to be oversized. 
(3)  Facilities. In general, all facilities depicted in any master plan or the water and/or sewer study are to be built by the city, using funds already available to the city and without immediate one-for-one reimbursement from a specific developer. However, it is intended that connection charges shall reimburse the city for those costs. Nothing herein shall preclude the city from entering into an agreement with developer to construct necessary facilities. It shall be the policy of the city that the costs of such facilities needed for future developments shall be borne primarily by reimbursements to the city from those developments, and that connection charges paid by those developments shall serve as an equitable means of accomplishing the reimbursements. Accordingly, when determined necessary by the city commission, the city will review projected future developments, connection charges to be paid by those developments, and projected costs of existing and new facilities needed to serve those developments. After each such review, the required connection charges will be adjusted in an attempt to ensure: 
a.  Approximate equality between the then current projected total connection charges to be received from future developments and the then current projected costs of facilities constructed to serve those developments. 
b.  The ratio of any one (1) connection charge to projected total connection charges from future developments approximately equal to the ratio of the utility services that development is expected to receive from new facilities and the total services to be provided by those facilities. 
c.  1.  It may occur that some of the facilities referenced in a water and/or sewer study will be needed to serve a proposed development, but the then current city construction program will not ensure that those facilities will be available at the time the developer desires to start his construction. In such a case, the developer may, if he wishes, request that he be allowed to assist in accelerating the construction of those facilities needed to serve his development. Upon receipt of such a request, the city will attempt to negotiate mutually agreeable terms concerning: whether the needed facilities will be built by the developer or by the city; who shall pay the costs of the construction; and how much, if any, of the costs paid by the developer will be returned to him in the future. The amount of any such reimbursement will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. 
2.  Regardless of the size of the agreed upon reimbursement for a developer's payment of the costs of facilities, that reimbursement shall be made from future connection charges. The reimbursement initially shall serve as a direct credit against the connection charges which the developer will be required to pay, as established in this chapter. In the event the agreed upon reimbursement exceeds his own connection charges, then the remainder of the reimbursement will be made from future connection charges, as they are received by the city from other developments. 
3.  Details of the reimbursement shall be stipulated in a negotiated developer's agreement, which will indicate: the amount of the reimbursement the developer is to receive, the period of reimbursement, whether reimbursement shall be from all connection charges collected in that period or only from those collected from specified geographical locations, and whether all or only a specified fraction of each eligible connection charge shall be used for reimbursement. 
(Ord. No. 866, § 2, 10-26-04) 
Sec. 20-5. - Utility facilities serving development 
(a)  Prior to preparing any detailed plans for either water or sewer facilities to serve a development, the developer shall submit to the city director of public services written notification of intention to connect to a city utility. Included with the notification should be a preliminary layout of the proposed development, including general location and proposed size of all proposed utility mains, both interior to the development and those necessary to connect to the existing system. Developer also should submit data as to projected water requirements, both for daily use and fire flow, and projected sewer requirements, both flow rates and type sewage. Unless otherwise indicated, it will be assumed that the developer intends to perform construction of all indicated new mains, without regard to location. 
(b)  After allowing a minimum of two (2) weeks for review of his submittal by the city and the engineer, the developer shall make telephone contact with the engineer to schedule a meeting with the director of public services and the engineer. The purpose of the meeting will be to reach tentative agreement as to design criteria, who will be performing the work, and if there will be a need for any oversizing or special construction of any facilities. At the same time, the developer should request information as to whether his development will be subject to any construction charges because of any previous over-sizing that had been considered as beneficial to his development. 
(c)  Thereafter, the developer shall submit to the director of public services a formal application for connection to the city utility, using forms furnished by the public services department. Included with the application will be final construction drawings and specifications, signed and sealed by a professional engineer registered in Florida, for all public facilities to be constructed by the developer and the required plan review charge. Upon review and approval of the application, the connection contract and the developer's agreement, if required, will be executed. 
(d)  If it has been agreed that the city is to perform any of the work, then prior to the city beginning to prepare the design and construction documents for that work, the developer shall make a deposit cash or check with the city equal to twenty-five (25) percent of the estimated total costs to be incurred by the city. The deposit shall be made at the same time as submittal of the application for connection to the city system. As soon as the city receives bids for its construction work, the developer shall deposit with the city an amount which, when added to the previous deposit, equals one hundred ten (11) percent of the total city costs, as then estimated. This deposit shall be in the form of cash, a check, or letter of credit from a credit provider acceptable to the city finance director and in a form approved by the city attorney's office. Upon completion of the work, a final accounting shall be made, with the developer making a formal payment to the city equal to actual final total costs incurred, and any unused deposit being returned to the developer. 
(e)  Any connection charges, construction charges, tapping charges, or meter charges which are due on each structure in a development shall be due and payable no later than issuance of a certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy for the structure or final inspection approval if no certificate of occupancy is required, and evidence of full payment of those charges shall be a prerequisite of issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Any funds collected pursuant to these charges may only be expended for the type of capital improvements for which such charges were imposed, calculated, and collected. 
(f)  In addition to the above requirements, the developer shall be responsible for accomplishing the following prior to receipt of a certificate of occupancy or a temporary certificate of occupancy: 
(1)  Designing and constructing all water and sewer plumbing on the property owner's side of each service connection. Application for permits, and payment of associated permit fees, for construction of this work shall be in accordance with ordinances and regulations for building permits and certificates of occupancy, as administered by the city community services department. However, in addition to any review done by the community services department, the portions of plumbing between buildings and service connections also shall be reviewed by the public services department. Therefore, whenever application is made to the community services department for a permit which includes plumbing to a service connection, a copy shall be submitted to the public services department by the developer. It shall be the responsibility of the public services and community services departments to ensure that review and comment by the public services department are taken into consideration by the community services department. 
(2)  Obtaining all permits required by the community services department and the city engineer for any work to be done by the developer in city rights-of-ways or easements. Application and payment of fees shall be as required in ordinances and regulations administered by those departments. 
(3)  Obtaining all permits required by county and state regulatory authorities for any mains to be constructed by the developer. Application and payment of fees shall be as required by those agencies. 
(4)  Submitting to the director of public services the following for any service connections, service laterals, mains, or other portions of the city's utility systems that have been constructed by the developer. 
a.  Three (3) prints of "as-built" drawings and the "as-built" drawings in a reproducible form acceptable to the director of public services, as reviewed and approved by both the developer's engineer of record and the engineer. 
b.  A legal document providing transfer of title to the city for all such property, using forms and/or samples as prepared or approved by the city attorney. 
c.  A one-year maintenance guarantee bond in the amount of twenty (20) percent of the construction costs. For one (1) year subsequent to approval of the work by the city director of public services, any repairs or replacements required by the work either shall be performed by the developer, or the bond shall be used to reimburse the city for costs incurred by the city in correcting the work. 
d.  Opening an active account for payment of monthly service charges, including payment of required security deposits and fees for opening the account. 
e.  The developer shall provide one (1) emergency generator and/or one (1) emergency by-pass pump at the city's discretion for each new lift station constructed or upgraded. 
(Ord. No. 866, § 2, 10-26-04) 
Sec. 20-6. - City commission approval for connection to a city utility. 
(a)  Within city limits. All developments located within the city limits, either established at the time of adoption of this chapter or as improved in the future, shall be required to connect to the city's utility systems when such systems are available. Such connections shall be made without any action by the city commission, except as follows: 
(1)  If a developer's agreement is required, the developer's agreement shall be accepted by resolution of the city commission, prior to execution of the connection contract between the developer and the city. 
(2)  The city utility systems are designed and constructed primarily for use by residential and commercial customers. No industrial customer shall connect to a city utility system unless the connection is specifically authorized in advance by the city commission. 
(3)  The city commission has determined that as of the adoption of this chapter, no existing or presently proposed user of the city's sewer system is an "EPA industrial user," as defined herein. Further, it has been determined that existing zoning regulations make it highly unlikely that a prospective user shall be an EPA industrial user. However, it shall be the policy of the city that an EPA Industrial User shall not be permitted to connect to he city's sewer system unless, and until, the city shall have amended this Code so as to incorporate an EPA approvable "industrial cost recovery system," as defined in Federal Regulations 40 CFR 35. 
(b)  Outside city limits. Property located outside the city limits shall not be allowed to connect to a city utility system unless the connection is authorized by the city commission.

(a)  The city shall attempt to provide in each area of the city the water quantities and pressures normally required for the daily uses and fire flows usually associated with buildings of up to three (3) stories in height which are constructed and utilized in accordance with the zoning applicable to each area. All extensions to the city water system constructed by a developer also shall be designed and constructed to provide at least that capability in every area that may be served by the extension. However, nothing in this Code shall be construed as a guarantee, expressed or implied, that either the city or a developer shall provide any specific quantity or pressure of water. 
(b)  It shall be the responsibility of each property owner to ascertain the quantity and pressure actually available to the property. In the event the property owner believes the quantity or pressure is not adequate for his purposes, then the property owner shall construct, operate and maintain on his own property such auxiliary pumping and storage facilities as he deems appropriate for his needs. This provision shall be particularly applicable to any structure having a height of more than three (3) stories.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 678, § 1, adopted Feb. 13, 1990, amended Art. II, § 20-47 of this chapter to provide as set forth in §§ 2-11 of said ordinance. At the discretion of the editor and for purposes of classification, §§ 2-11 of Ord. No. 678 have been codified as Art. IV, §§ 20-91-20-100 of this chapter. 
Cross reference- Cross-connecting services, § 20-47. 

Sec. 20-91. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to comply with the rules promulgated by the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation contained in Chapter 17-22, Florida Administrative Code. These regulations require water purveyors to establish a routine cross-connection control program for the purpose of detecting and protecting cross-connections that create, or have the potential to create, an imminent and substantial danger to public health by and from contamination of the public water system. 
(Ord. No. 678, § 2, 2-13-90) 
Sec. 20-92. - Responsibility. 
    The director of public services of the City of Wilton Manors shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the judgement of the director, the city's back-flow technician, an approved back-flow prevention assembly is required at the customer's water service connection for the safety of the water system, the director or his designated agent shall give notice in writing to said customer to install such approved backflow prevention assembly(s) at specific location(s) on his premises. The consumer shall immediately install such approved assembly(s) at the consumer s own expense; and, failure, refusal or inability on the part of the consumer to install, have tested and maintain said assembly(s) shall constitute a ground for discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met. 
(Ord. No. 678, § 3, 2-13-90) 
Sec. 20-93. - Findings of fact. 
    The director of public services finds that the most useful and productive method of eliminating or reducing the risk of degradation of the potable water system due to contamination through cross-connection is by instituting a phased program requiring back-flow prevention assemblies or methods at all interface points between the public water system and the customer's system. 
(Ord. No. 678, § 4, 2-13-90) 
Sec. 20-94. - Definitions. 
(a)  Air gap separations: A physical separation between the free-flowing discharge end of a potable water supply pipeline and an open or non-pressure receiving vessel.

(b)  Approved: Accepted by the director as meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in this article, or as suitable for the proposed use. 
(c)  Auxiliary water supply: Any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public water supply will be considered as an auxiliary water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural source(s) such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, canal, etc., or "used water" or "industrial fluids." These waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control. 
(d)  Back-flow: The unwanted reversal in direction of flow of water in a pipeline caused by either back-pressure or back-siphonage. 
(e)  Back-pressure: The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances under pressure into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from any source or sources other than the intended source. 
(f)  Back-siphonage: The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply from any source other than its intended source caused by the reduction of pressure in the potable water supply system. 
(g)  Back-flow prevention assembly: An effective assembly, approved by the director as meeting required specifications, used to prevent back-flow into a potable water system. The type of assembly used shall be based on the degree of hazard either existing or potential. The types are: 
(1)  Air gap. 
(2)  Double-check valve assembly. 
(3)  Reduced pressure principle assembly. 
(4)  Detector double-check valve assembly. 
(5)  Dual check valve assembly. 
(6)  Pressure vacuum breaker. 
(7)  Atmospheric vacuum breaker.

    The purpose of these regulations is to encourage and promote, in accordance with present and future needs, the health, safety, order, convenience, prosperity and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Wilton Manors; and to provide for efficiency and economy in the process of development, for the appropriate and best use of land, for preservation, protection, development and conservation of the natural resources of land, water and air, for convenience of traffic and circulation of people and goods, for the use and occupancy of buildings, for public utilities and facilities, for promotion of the civic amenities of beauty and visual interest, and for development in accord with the comprehensive development plan by establishing zoning districts and land development regulations, and by regulating the location and use of buildings, signs and other structures, water and land for commerce, industry, community facilities and residence, and by regulating and limiting or determining the height, bulk and access to light and air of buildings and structures, the area of yards and other open spaces and the density of use. 
Sec. 005-030. - Compliance with regulations required.

Furthermore, no building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in conformance with these regulations. 
Sec. 005-040. - Building permits denied where change might violate district regulations. 
    When plans and specifications are submitted to the Department for a permit to erect a residence in a single-family zoning district, and should such plans and specifications, in the opinion of the Director, be of a structure which might be used as a rooming or boarding house, duplex, or apartment house, or could easily be modified to serve such purpose, or that the plumbing, gas lines or electric wiring, other than installed in the kitchen, may be used for purposes other than for the ordinary use of single-family residence, then the Director shall have the right to refuse to issue a building permit therefore. Appeals from the decision of the Director may be made to the City Commission.

ARTICLE 15. - NONCONFORMING USES, BUILDINGS AND LOTS 
DIVISION 1. - NONCONFORMING USES 

Sec. 015-010. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this Article is to regulate and limit the development and continued existence of lawfully established uses, buildings and lots established prior to the effective date of these regulations which do not conform to the requirements of these regulations. Many non-conformities may continue, but the provisions of this Article are designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconformities and to bring about their eventual elimination in order to preserve the integrity of these regulations and enhance the character of the City. Any nonconforming use, building, or lot which lawfully existed as of the effective date of these regulations, and which remains nonconforming, and any use, building, or lot which has become nonconforming as a result of the adoption of these regulations or any subsequent amendment hereto may be continued or maintained only in accordance with the terms of this Article. 
Sec. 015-020. - Change in nonconforming use. 
    A nonconforming use may be replaced only by a permitted or conditionally permitted use of the zoning district within which the property is located. Whenever a nonconforming use has been replaced by a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be replaced by a nonconforming use. 
Sec. 015-030. - Discontinuance of nonconforming use. 
(A)  Nonconforming use of a building. Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, or for a total of eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period, whether or not the equipment or fixtures are removed, then that use shall not be renewed or re-established, and any subsequent use of the building, land or portion thereof shall conform with the regulations of the district in which such building or land is located. 
(B)  Nonconforming use of land without a principal building. In any district where land is lawfully being used as a nonconforming use, and such use is the main use and not accessory to a main use conducted in a building, such use shall be discontinued not later than five (5) years from the date of adoption of these regulations or any amendment hereto that renders a use of said land nonconforming, provided that, if the use is discontinued for a period exceeding 90 consecutive days, the land shall not again be used except in conformance with these regulations. Any building incident and subordinate to such use of land shall be removed at the end of the five (5) year period or ninety (90) day period of discontinuance, or if such building is so designed and constructed as to permit the issuance of a permit for a use not excluded from the district, such building may remain as a conforming use; thereafter, both land and building shall be used only as conforming uses. 
Sec. 015-040. - Moving or expansion of nonconforming use. 
    The nonconforming use of a building or land may occupy only those parts of a building or land which were lawfully and manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of passage of these regulations or any amendment hereto that renders a use nonconforming. A nonconforming use shall not be moved, expanded or extended beyond the building or lot area that it occupied on the effective date of these regulations or any amendment to these regulations rendering the use nonconforming.

    No building devoted to a nonconforming use that has been damaged by any cause whatever to the extent of more than fifty (50) per cent of the county tax-assessed value of the building shall be restored except in conformity with these regulations. All rights as a nonconforming use shall be terminated. If a building is damaged by less than fifty (50) per cent of the tax-assessed value, it may be repaired and used as before the time of damage, provided that such repairs or reconstruction are substantially completed within eighteen (18) months of the date of such damage. 
Sec. 015-070. - Intermittent or unlawful use. 
(A)  The casual, intermittent, temporary or illegal use of land or buildings shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use or to create any vested rights in the continuance of such use, and the existence of a nonconforming use on a part of a lot or tract shall not be construed to establish a nonconforming use on the entire lot or tract. 
(B)  Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as authorization for, or approval of, the continuation of the use of a building or premises in violation of any ordinance or resolution in effect at the time the use was initially established on the premises. 
(C)  Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as authorization for, or approval of, the use of any lot established in violation of any law, regulation or ordinance in effect at the time the lot was established. 
Sec. 015-080. - Determination of nonconforming use status. 
    The Director shall make an initial determination of the existence of a nonconforming use based upon evidence furnished by the applicant for the determination. Although the Director may make use of affidavits and investigation as the Director determines necessary in a particular case, the applicant for the determination shall bear the burden of proof that the property is entitled to legal nonconforming use status. 
    The question as to whether a nonconforming use exists shall be a question of fact and in case of doubt or challenge raised to the initial determination made, the question shall be decided by the City Commission following the procedures and requirements for appeals of administrative decisions set forth in Article 125.

    Any building or structure for which a lawful building permit has been issued, and the construction of which has been started prior to the effective date of these regulations, or any amendment hereto, which does not conform to any requirement of these regulations, may be completed and used in accordance with the plans and specifications upon which said building permit was granted. 
Sec. 015-110. - Moving of a nonconforming building. 
    A nonconforming building shall not be moved in whole or in part unless every portion of such building and the use thereof is made to conform with all requirements of the zoning district to which such building is moved. The moving of the building also shall comply with the requirements of applicable City regulations regarding the moving of buildings. 
Sec. 015-120. - Repair, alteration and expansion of nonconforming buildings. 
    A building nonconforming only as to height, area, yards, lot coverage, open space, pervious area, or bulk requirements may be repaired, altered or extended, provided any alteration or extension does not increase the degree of nonconformity in any respect, and provided the use of the extended or altered portion of the building conforms to all use regulations of the district in which it is located. 
DIVISION 3. - NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD 

Sec. 015-130. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
    Any legal lot of record that does not comply with the area or dimensional requirements of these regulations may be used for any use permitted by the zoning district within which the lot is located, provided that the owner of the lots does not own an abutting lot. In the event an owner of a nonconforming lot owns an abutting lot, the lots must be combined to meet the minimum area and dimensional requirements of the zoning district and provided that all development standards and dimensional requirements shall be complied with. 
    Multiple platted lots titled as a single parcel and located in the areas described in subsection 020-060 "Residential District Development Standards" may only be subdivided if such subdivision of each lot complies with the minimum dimensional requirements of subsection 020-060, as amended. Lots, or portions of lots, shall not be subdivided by sale or otherwise if such sale or subdivision creates nonconformity with subsection 020-060 or increases an existing nonconformity. 
    Specific uses required to have a greater lot area or dimensional requirement than the minimum district standard shall not be permitted on a nonconforming lot unless the PZB grants a variance for the area or dimensional requirement.

Sec. 020-020. - District map. 
    The locations of these districts are shown on a map designated as the City of Wilton Manors Zoning District Map, dated and signed by the Mayor and City Clerk upon adoption. This zoning district map, together with all notations, dimensions, references and symbols shown thereon, pertaining to such districts, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be as much a part of the ULDR as if fully described herein. Said map shall be available for public inspection in the Department and any later alterations to this map, adopted by amendment as provided in these regulations, shall be similarly dated, filed, and made available for public reference. 
Sec. 020-030. - Interpretation of district boundaries. 
(A)  A district name or symbol shown on the district maps indicates that the regulations pertaining to the district designated by that name or letter-number combination extend throughout the whole area in the municipality bounded by the district boundary lines within which such name or symbol is shown or indicated, except as otherwise provided by this Section. 
(B)  Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules apply: 
(1)  In cases where a boundary line is given a position within a street or alley, easement, canal, navigable or non-navigable waterway, it will be deemed to be in the center of the right-of-way. If the street, alley, easement, canal, or waterway varies slightly from the location as shown on the district map, then the actual location controls. 
(2)  In cases where a boundary line is shown as being located a specific distance from a street line or other physical feature, this distance controls. 
(3)  When a parcel of property is crossed by a zoning district boundary and the property thus lies in two (2) zoning districts, any development must conform to the most restrictive lot area, lot width, building setback, and similar regulations if the proposed development crosses the zone line. 
Sec. 020-031. - Irregularly shaped lots; interpretation of required yards. 
    In the event a lot is of an irregular shape, and required yards are in question, the Director shall determine required yard locations based upon the concepts set forth in these regulations. 
Sec. 020-032. - Lots with multiple front yards in residential districts; reduction of required yards. 
    In residential zoning districts, one of the front yards may be reduced by up to five (5) feet when a lot is located on a corner or has multiple front yards. The property owner may choose which setback to reduce, subject to approval of the Director. 
(Ord. No. 860, § 2, 1-11-05) 
Sec. 020-040. - Schedule of district regulations, generally. 
    The schedules that follow set forth the permitted uses and development standards pertaining to required yards, bulk and height for each zoning district in the City.

Sec. 020-110. - Additional ROSC district development standards. 
    Prior to rezoning any property to the ROSC District, the Commission shall adopt specific development standards categorized in the table above, in a redevelopment plan for the district to supplement the standards set forth below for each ROSC District established. The adopted standards for each plan shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of this section and shall be designed to produce an urban environment of equal or superior quality to that which would result from strict adherence to the provisions and requirements of the previous zoning. It shall be determined that all deviations from site development standards of the previous zoning are necessary for reasonable and practical physical development of the property, and are not required solely on the basis of financial consideration. All ROSC District development standards established within adopted redevelopment plans are hereby incorporated by reference. 
(A)  Residential uses. All structures erected or altered for use strictly as a detached single-family and duplex residential dwelling shall conform to RS-5 and RD-10 development standards, respectively. 
(B)  Commercial and mixed (residential/commercial) uses. Prior to the issuance of a local business tax receipt or any building permit for commercial or mixed uses, where exterior building and/or site modifications are proposed or required, a site plan complying with Article 85, Site Plans, shall be submitted for approval. The construction of new buildings or structures, and the moving, reconstruction, repair or alteration of existing buildings to a commercial use, including color changes which materially affect the external appearance of the building, shall be of such design, form, height, proportion, configuration, materials, textures, color and location on the plot as are consistent with the adopted redevelopment plan for the district. All commercial and mixed-use structures are bound by the following standards: 
(1)  Landscaping: Landscape standards set forth in Article 150, Landscaping, for single-family detached residences shall be used, except that all perimeter vehicular use area landscaping standards also set forth in Article 150 shall apply. 
(2)  Off-street parking: Adequate parking shall be provided to meet the demands of the proposed use without requiring off-premises parking, however, parking facilities shall maintain the aesthetic appearance of residential uses. The City shall use the following criteria as guidelines for determining whether parking facilities are characterized as residential in appearance: 
a.  Minimized use of curbing and parking space striping within vehicular use areas. 
b.  Minimized parking in the front yard, with greater reliance on the rear yard, and secondarily, the side yard where possible. 
c.  Stacking of employee and resident parking, with back-out parking permitted. 
d.  Use of alternative parking surfaces, approved by the City Engineer, for large parking areas, to soften the impact of vehicular uses areas normally paved with asphalt.

Sec. 030-010. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of the Urban Center Mixed-Use Districts ("Urban Center Districts") is to encourage and facilitate the development of a mixture of residential units, entertainment, cultural facilities, restaurants, shopping, commercial, retail, and professional office uses within a safe and convenient walkable environment that supports all modes of transportation, and specifically supports high-frequency bus and commuter rail service, and meets the needs of the residential and working populations of the City. This Article encourages and directs orderly, compatible development and redevelopment that relates to the desirable pedestrian nature of the Urban Center Districts, enhances the aesthetics and physical appearance of the Urban Center Districts through implementation of specific site and building design regulations, ensures a prosperous and viable twenty-four (24)-hour urban environment, and reinforces the role of the Urban Center Districts as a community gathering and meeting place for residents and visitors. 
    The Urban Center Districts promote transit-oriented development and further the following goals and objectives established by the City Commission in Strategic Plan 2001-2006: 
Goal 1: Sustainable Urban Village 
Objective 1: Development/Redevelopment on a "Human" Scale-Preserving Our Character 
Objective 2: Personalized Services to Our Businesses, to Our Citizens 
Objective 3: Livable Neighborhoods Integrating Commercial and Residential 
Objective 4: Small Town Feeling with Access to Beach, to Urban Amenities 
Objective 5: Maintaining a Distinctive Community Identity 
Goal 2: Financially Sound City Government 
Objective 2: Broaden City's Tax Base 
Goal 4: Wilton Drive: Destination Point 
Objective 1: Pedestrian-Friendly Development and Redevelopment 
Objective 2: Adequate Parking to Support Destination Point 
Objective 3: Attractive Streetscape and Buildings 
Objective 4: Increase Businesses: Professional Offices, Retail (Upscale) 
Objective 5: Increase Number of Events and Festivals Using Area 
Goal 5: People Want to Live in Our Neighborhoods 
Objective 1: Safe Streets, Controlled Traffic Flow, Pedestrian Friendly 
Objective 2: Increase Property/Home Values-Desirable, Fashionable Place to Live 
Objective 3: Well Maintained, Attractive Streets 
    The Urban Center District regulations are intended to promote the cultural, economic, educational, and general welfare of the residents of the City by encouraging a mix of uses that enhances the visibility of publicly funded cultural facilities, parks, and other improvements. The Urban Center District regulations are also intended to promote viable neighborhoods integrating commercial and residential uses, an objective that is considered top priority in Strategic Plan 2001 - 2006. The Urban Center District regulations provide incentives for new development and redevelopment that will enhance and expand the high-quality urban, mixed-use environment that has been established around the Wilton Drive corridor. 
    The alcoholic beverage regulations are intended to promote the location of restaurants and entertainment facilities in the City's Urban Center Districts by exempting such uses from the distance separation requirements established in Section 050-020, Establishments selling alcoholic beverages; location restrictions, and from certain provisions of Chapter 3 of the City Code. 
    The parking regulations are intended to promote the location of restaurants, entertainment facilities and other high-demand parking uses within the City's Urban Center Districts by superseding the offstreet parking requirements established by Article 135, Off-Street Parking with standards for parking that accurately reflect the parking efficiencies that are achieved with a mix of land uses of urban intensity and transit-oriented design. The parking regulations are intended to encourage pedestrian-oriented uses such as outdoor dining, and promote the pedestrian character and nature of the Urban Center Districts, which is located proximate to vibrant residential neighborhoods. Location of such uses in proximity to each other within the Urban Center Districts will promote walkability and discourage excessive automobile use.

Sec. 030-062. - Residential uses. 
    Residential uses are subject to the following regulations within the WDAE District in all cases, and within the TOC-N, TOC-S, and TOC-E Districts only in cases where the flexibility provisions are utilized for residential development. 
(A)  Pool of flexibility units established. A pool of flexibility units and affordable housing flexibility units has been established for use on parcels designated commercial within the Urban Center Districts, subject to regulations outlined below. The Department of Community Services shall maintain charts reflecting the total units available. As such units are utilized, the Department of Community Services shall update the charts to reflect utilization of such units.

(Ord. No. 999, § 3, 2-13-12) 
Sec. 030-063. - Alcoholic beverage sale within the Urban Center Districts. 
(A)  Minimum distance requirements between establishments. There shall be no minimum distance separation required between any place of business within the Urban Center Districts licensed by the state to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on premises and any other place of business licensed by the state to sell alcoholic beverages on or off the premises within the Urban Center Districts. 
(B)  Places of business licensed to sell alcoholic beverages either for consumption on or off premises located outside of the Urban Center Districts and existing at the time of enactment of this Section shall not be nonconforming for failure to satisfy the minimum required distance separation from any establishment located within the Urban Center Districts licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. For the purpose of minimum distance separation requirements between places of business within the Urban Center Districts licensed to sell alcoholic beverages and places of business similarly licensed outside the Urban Center Districts which were not in existence at the time of enactment of this Section, distance separation shall be measured from the edges of the Urban Center Districts, and not to any physical establishment within the Urban Center Districts, and all of the Urban Center Districts shall thereafter be considered one establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. 
(C)  Minimum distance required from place of worship or school. There shall be no minimum distance required between any place of business within the Urban Center Districts licensed by the state to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on or off premises and any place of worship or school. 
(D)  Outdoor sale of alcoholic beverages. Places of business within the Urban Center Districts, properly licensed by the state to sell alcoholic beverages, may sell and serve alcoholic beverages outdoors at any location within the Urban Center Districts and under the control of the licensee, provided the ULDR otherwise permit the business at the location and the City licenses the business to sell beverages outdoors, including, but not limited to, sidewalk cafes, outdoor areas designated for food or beverage consumption, or both, adjacent to and operated in concert with a place of business operated within the enclosed premises, licensed freestanding structures including outdoor bars and kiosks selling food and beverages including alcoholic beverages, and pushcart type vehicles (excluding permitted vending carts on public property).

(Ord. No. 999, § 3, 2-13-12) 
Sec. 030-064. - Nonconforming uses. 
(A)  Intent. It is the intent of this Section to recognize that the transformation of the TOC districts from predominantly industrial and heavy commercial in nature to a transit-oriented urban center will in part be dependent upon infrastructure investments and supporting market conditions, the timing of which is uncertain. Accordingly, classes of uses that conformed to the requirements of the previous zoning designations, but which have been made nonconforming by the adoption of the TOC districts, are given more latitude to continue than would otherwise be the case for a nonconforming use. 
(B)  Applicability. 
(1)  This Section applies to the TOC-N, TOC-S and TOC-E Districts, and does not apply to the WDAE District. 
(2)  This Section supersedes any conflicting regulation in Article 15 ULDR, Division 1, Nonconforming Uses. All provisions of Article 15 not in conflict with this Section shall apply. 
(C)  Changes in nonconforming use. 
(1)  A use that is nonconforming as to the TOC use regulations, but which was permitted or conditionally permitted in the zoning designation in effect prior to the adoption of the TOC districts, may be replaced by another use that is permitted or conditionally permitted in the prior district, subject to compliance with all requirements applicable to such use, including the requirement to obtain conditional use approval, if applicable. 
(2)  Once a nonconforming use is replaced with a use that is permitted or conditionally permitted in the TOC districts, such use shall not thereafter be replaced by a nonconforming use. 
(3)  A change of use within the TOC-N and TOC-S Districts will not require provision of additional parking pursuant to Section 135-060 unless the principal building increases in size by more than twenty (20) percent, or if the new use is a food and/or beverage establishment, bar, lounge or nightclub, which must meet the requirements of Section 030-110. 
(D)  Discontinuance of nonconforming use. Section 015-030 shall apply to the discontinuance of nonconforming uses. 
(E)  Moving or expansion of a nonconforming use. A use that is nonconforming as to the TOC use regulations, but which was permitted or conditionally permitted in the zoning designation in effect prior to the adoption of the TOC Districts, may be moved, extended or expanded. The moving, extending or expansion of a nonconforming building is subject to Article 15, ULDR, Division 2, Nonconforming Buildings. 
(F)  Repair and alteration of a building devoted to a nonconforming use. A building devoted to a nonconforming use may be repaired and altered in compliance with all applicable development standards and regulations of the ULDR. The repair and alteration of a nonconforming building devoted to a nonconforming use is subject to Article 15, ULDR. 
(G)  Destruction of a building devoted to a nonconforming use. 
(1)  A conforming building devoted to a nonconforming use may be repaired, rebuilt and restored in the event of damage or destruction, in compliance with all applicable development standards and regulations of the ULDR. 
(2)  A nonconforming building devoted to a nonconforming use may be repaired, rebuilt and restored only in compliance with Section 015-090, Destruction of a nonconforming building. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 3, 2-13-12) 
Sec. 030-070. - General site design provisions. 
(A)  Site design shall incorporate safe and convenient vehicular use areas and pedestrian ways, with landscaping, lighting, sidewalks and other pedestrian amenities, signage and other site elements intended to result in a comprehensive, compatible design. 
(B)  Site design shall promote principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) as promulgated by the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Florida, including: 
(1)  Natural access control - Through use of sidewalks, pavement, lighting and landscaping to clearly guide the public to and from entrances and exits. 
(2)  Territorial reinforcement - Through use of pavement treatments, landscaping, art, signage, screening and fences to define and outline ownership of property. 
(3)  Natural surveillance/visibility - Through placement and design of physical features to maximize visibility; through placement of persons and/or activities to maximize surveillance possibilities; and through lighting to provide nighttime illumination of parking lots, walkways, entrances and exits. 
(4)  Maintenance - Through use of low maintenance landscaping and lighting treatment to facilitate CPTED principles of natural surveillance, natural access control and territorial reinforcement. 
(5)  Defensible space. 
(C)  Overhead utilities. Site design shall include relocation of overhead utilities underground or along the rear lot line, as determined by the Planning & Zoning Board. 
(D)  Loading areas, mechanical equipment, transformer boxes, dumpster enclosures. Structures and uses that are required in Section 030-081 to be screened shall not be located adjacent to a frontage line, and shall not be visible from public rights-of-way.

A minimum sixteen (16) square feet around each tree trunk shall be covered with a permeable tree grate or other permeable surface designed for such use in order to ensure adequate air and water penetration. 
(I)  Streetside pedestrian areas. To enhance the pedestrian nature of the Urban Center Districts site design shall include the following streetside space as illustrated in the figure below along all primary and secondary street frontages (see definitions in Section 030-030 for list of primary and secondary streets). The entire streetside space shall be uniform in elevation. Larger pedestrian areas are encouraged in the absence of a facade on a frontage line through creation of plazas, outdoor dining areas, courtyards, or arcades. Paved areas in plazas and courtyards shall consist of materials compatible with materials utilized in other onsite pedestrian areas. 

(1)  Building Frontage or Building/ROW Zone (BROWZ). This zone shall extend ten (10) feet in width behind the Pedestrian Through Zone (as hereinafter defined), parallel to the street line. The back edge of the BROWZ forms the frontage line where the front wall of the adjacent building or streetwall shall be located as required in this Article. Upper stories may project over the BROWZ, but not forward of the street line. 
(a)  The Planning & Zoning Board may approve additional BROWZ width at the time of site plan approval upon its determination that the additional width will provide for greater pedestrian amenities, such as but not limited to, a plaza or expanded outdoor dining and entertainment area, and will not compromise the sense of street enclosure . 
(b)  The Planning & Zoning Board, when considering a site plan application, may eliminate or reduce the depth of the BROWZ upon lots that would have a buildable depth, as defined in this Article, of less than one hundred sixty (160) feet, without the need for a variance or exception, provided that the waiver or reduction is needed to accommodate a parking structure with a liner building fronting the street, or otherwise is required in order for the site to accommodate a building of at least two (2) stories in height. 
(c)  It is not the intent of this Section to require demolition or alteration of an existing building in order to create a BROWZ. 
(d)  The BROWZ can contain paved area, bicycle racks, street furniture, landscaping and planters, outdoor dining, and other pedestrian amenities all of which shall be consistent with the Wilton Drive Streetscape Plan. 
(2)  Pedestrian Through Zone (PTZ). This zone shall be comprised of a public sidewalk within the street right-of-way, at least six (6) feet wide, which may consist of textured or special paving such as brick pavers or stamped concrete and shall be integrated into the pedestrian network of sidewalk and walkways that already exist. Obstructions of any kind are prohibited within the PTZ and it should be maintained entirely free of any permanent or temporary objects. 
(3)  Roadside Zone (RZ). This zone shall be at least six (6) feet wide within the street right-of-way, and shall be located between the curb face and the PTZ.

(J)  Abutting residentially zoned, a minimum ten (10) foot public or private alley shall be provided between the required rear yard landscape buffer and buildings on the development site to facilitate deliveries and vehicular circulation. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 3, 2-13-12) 
Sec. 030-080. - Landscaping; pervious area. 
(A)  The minimum pervious area requirement is established is a percentage of lot area in the table below. The symbol (<) means "less than" and the symbol (>) means "greater than". 
(B)  Notwithstanding Subsection (A), all townhouse lots shall provide a minimum twenty (20) percent landscaped pervious area. 
Parcel size Required pervious area <1.5 acres None required 1.5-2.0 acres At least 6 percent >2.0-2.5 acres At least 8 percent >2.5-3.0 acres At least 10 percent >3.0-3.5 acres At least 12 percent >3.5-4.0 acres At least 14 percent >4.0-4.5 acres At least 16 percent >4.5-5.0 acres At least 18 percent >5.0 acres At least 20 percent

ARTICLE 40. - URBAN INFILL/REDEVELOPMENT PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT 

Sec. 040-010. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this district is to stimulate the reinvestments necessary for the viable redevelopment of existing commercial, industrial and residential districts by permitting land under unified control to be planned and developed as a whole. Planned unit development substitutes performance standards and design review for the more restrictive controls of conventional zoning. This enables a more creative design approach allowing planned diversification in location and types of structures and permitted uses. These regulations are intended to provide a design review procedures based upon performance standards which will preserve and enhance the aesthetic qualities of the City, encourage large-scale land assembly and promote redevelopment and infill development. The following objectives are established as the purpose for creating an Urban Infill/Redevelopment Planned Unit Development (PUD) District: 
(A)  To establish and maintain municipal control over the eventual character of development through a design review process that ensures conformance with the Comprehensive Plan, other goals, objectives and policies of the City, and the ULDR; and 
(B)  To encourage the development of a mixture of low and midrise office buildings with ancillary ground floor retail space, structured parking oriented away from the street, low-medium and medium density residences and private/public open space within areas in need of redevelopment; and 
(C)  To encourage the assembly of land parcels and their more efficient utilization to reduce developmental costs and provide a more sustainable community; and 
(D)  To preserve to the greatest extent possible existing amenities such as landscape, natural terrain, river shoreline and other outstanding topographical and geological features; and 
(E)  To provide for adequate and suitably located open space and recreation areas for the projected population of the development and surrounding community; and 
(F)  To provide adequate transportation infrastructure to prevent the over burdening of existing streets and parking facilities; and 
(G)  To encourage urban infill development and redevelopment and to provide adequate housing opportunities necessary for all segments of the present and future population of the City by the application of the flexibility provisions of the Broward County Comprehensive Plan; and 
(H)  To encourage mixed-use development within urban infill, urban redevelopment and downtown revitalization areas of the City by the application of the Urban Infill/Redevelopment Planned Unit Development District. 
(Ord. No. 873, § 2, 7-12-05) 
Sec. 040-020. - Definitions. 
    The definitions listed below will have the following meanings within this article: 
(A)  Board. The Planning and Zoning Board of the City of Wilton Manors. 
(B)  FLUM. Future Land Use Map. 
(C)  Planned unit development. Land under unified control, planned and developed as a single entity or in approved stages, in conformity with an approved site plan, specific development standards set forth in the PUD document, and development schedule. 
(D)  PUD document. A document that contains all of the zoning and land development regulations that will govern the development and use of the PUD, including specific development standards (i.e. building height, required setback, density, minimum lot area, landscaping, parking, open space, lot coverage, sign regulations, etc.) and list of permitted, conditional and prohibited uses. The approved site plan may be utilized in conjunction with this document to specify certain development standards through graphical and text representations. The approved PUD Document and site plan shall be exhibits to the ordinance approving the rezoning to PUD. 
(Ord. No. 871, § 2, 5-10-05) 
Sec. 040-030. - Permitted uses and maximum density. 
(A)  There are three (3) types of PUD districts, as identified below. All permitted uses are subject to subparagraphs (A), (B) and (C). 
(1)  PUD-R. 
a.  Permitted location. PUD-R is intended for location on a property with a residential FLUM designation. 
b.  Permitted uses. 
1)  Residential uses, in any arrangement or combination of dwelling types, but not to exceed the total number of units permitted by the underlying residential Future Land Use Plan Map designation(s) of the Comprehensive Plan not to exceed the density specified in Section 040-050; 
2)  Public recreation and open space uses. 
(2)  PUD-M. 
a.  Location. PUD-M is intended for location on property with residential, community facilities, Transit Oriented Corridor and/or commercial FLUM designations. 
b.  Permitted uses. At least two (2) uses must be proposed. All residential dwelling types, all non-residential uses permitted by the underlying land use plan designations, and public recreation and open space uses, with the number of residential units not to exceed the total number of dwelling units permitted by the underlying residential future land use plan map designation(s), and the amount of commercial acreage not to exceed the acreage of land designated commercial on the FLUM within the PUD. Permitted uses shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (C), below. Use of the flexibility provisions may be necessary to achieve a mix of uses, depending upon the type and location of underlying FLUM designations not to exceed the density specified in Section 040-050. 
(3)  PUD-C. 
a.  Permitted location. PUD-C is intended for location on a property with a Transit Oriented Corridor, commercial and/or community facility FLUM designation. 
b.  Permitted uses. All non-residential uses permitted by the underlying land use plan designations, and public recreation and open space in any arrangement or combination of uses but not to exceed the total intensity of use that would be permitted in the underlying FLUM designation(s). Permitted uses shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (C), below. 
(B)  Permitted and conditional uses shall be as outlined in the approved PUD document, within the scope of uses permitted in this article, and consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. Uses that are incompatible with other permitted and conditional uses of adjacent zoning districts shall not be permitted unless specific buffering, locational restrictions or other mitigation is required in the PUD document. 
(C)  Future land use plan map designations and flexibility provisions. 
(1)  All permitted uses must be consistent with those of the underlying future land use plan map designation. For example, a PUD-M with underlying commercial and residential FLUM designations must be developed with commercial uses located within the commercially designated portion of the PUD, and residential uses located within the residentially designated portion of the PUD. 
(2)  Flexibility provisions are a function of the Wilton Manors Comprehensive Plan and Broward County Land Use Plan, which are fully explained within the implementation requirements portion of the City's Future Land Use Element and incorporated by reference in these regulations. Flexibility provisions generally, and within strict limits, allow land designated commercial on the future land use plan map to be used for residential purposes; for land designated residential to be used for limited commercial purposes; and for land designated residential to be developed at a higher density than the land use plan map designation allows. Further clarification is provided, as follows: 
a.  A PUD overlaying one or more residential land use plan map designations may be developed with the total number of residential dwellings allowed by the particular plan designations within the property. For example, if two (2) acres are designated for five (5) dwellings per acre and one acre is designated for ten (10) dwellings per acre, the total number of allowable dwelling is twenty (20). Commercial and office uses, or additional residential units, would only be permitted subject to the future land use plan element mixed-use and flexibility provisions. 
b.  A PUD with an underlying commercial land use plan map designation will not permit residential uses without the application of the flexibility rules. 
(3)  Flexibility and reserve units may be allocated to an urban infill/redevelopment PUD at the time of rezoning approval in accordance with the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan.

(1)  Wheeled bulk containers for the disposal of solid waste or the collection of recyclables which are one cubic yard in size or smaller are exempt from the enclosure requirements of this Section. 
(2)  Use of one wheeled bulk container per property, greater than one cubic yard in size but not exceeding two (2) cubic yards in size, is exempt from the enclosure requirements of this Section provided that, when not curbside for collection, it is positioned upon a hard surfaced pad located behind the forward building line(s) of the user location, and it is positioned such that the smaller side of the bulk container faces the public right-of-way, and a hard surface roll-way from the pad to the servicing area is provided to facilitate servicing. Wheeled bulk containers shall only be placed curbside for collection as permitted by Article 1, Section 16-9, Solid Waste, of the Code of Ordinances, as may be amended. 
(3)  On sites where a bulk container cannot be seen from off-site, at a height of five (5) feet above existing grade at any property line of the site, no enclosure shall be required. 
(4)  No enclosure shall be required for bulk containers located on interior lots, behind the extension of the building line that directly abuts any alley. 
(C)  Placement. Bulk containers shall be placed for collection purposes in a location easily accessible to authorized collection vehicles. Unless in a public right-of-way for purposes of collection only, all bulk containers shall be placed within an approved enclosure as set out below in Subsection (E) and at any time of day on the scheduled collection day, containers may be placed in position for direct pickup by the authorized agency as provided herein. 
(D)  It shall be unlawful for any person to place, or cause to be placed, a bulk container or receptacle that services private property upon or in any street, alley, or public right-of-way; provided, however, that such container or receptacle may be placed in the public right-of-way only for the period of time necessary for collection. The containers shall be returned to their approved enclosure or location on the same day that they are set out for collection. 
(E)  Enclosure requirements. The following enclosure requirements shall be met by all properties as described below. 
(1)  Where required. All residential properties of four (4) or more units and all business and industrial properties that elect to use bulk containers, shall provide an on-site enclosure for bulk containers or waste receptacles, except as provided herein. 
(2)  Minimum size. Each enclosure shall provide a minimum of eighteen (18) inches of clear space between each side of each bulk container (including lifting flanges) and the adjacent wall surface of the enclosure, or other containers within that same enclosure. The height of each enclosure shall be six (6) inches greater than the highest part of any bulk container therein. 
(3)  Service access. Placement of containers and enclosures shall be planned and constructed in a manner that allows unobstructed access to each container and the unobstructed opening of the gates during the emptying process. Containers shall not be located in such a manner that the service vehicle will block any intersection during the emptying process. 
(4)  Gates. All enclosures shall have gates and their construction shall be of sturdy metal frame and hinges, or other acceptable material as determined by the Director, with an opaque facing material. Servicing gates shall incorporate gate stops and latches that are functional in the full open and closed positions. Enclosures with gates that swing out from the container shall be set back from the property line at least a distance equal to the width of the gate. Hinge assemblies shall be strong and durable so that access and servicing gates function properly and do not sag. All gates for pedestrian access shall be no more than forty-eight (48) inches in height and no less than thirty-six (36) inches in width. Enclosure gates shall be closed at all times except for the time necessary to service the bulk container(s). 
(5)  Maze or baffle style openings. Maze or baffle style openings shall be permitted in place of an operating, pedestrian access gate. A maze style opening is an opaque wall or fence that can be located no more than forty-eight (48) inches and no less than thirty-six (36) inches from the enclosure opening and must be a minimum length of one and one-half (11/2) times the length of the opening and shall be centered upon the opening. These openings shall be no more than forty-eight (48) inches and no less than thirty-six (36) inches in width. 
(6)  Pads and service drives. All enclosures shall be placed on pured concrete, solid, or perforated interlocking concrete block paving (ICB), or any existing hardened paving system. A service access drive for the purpose of emptying the bulk container shall also be provided unless a hard surface that provides access to the bulk container already exists. Such pads and approach drives shall replace existing curb, gutter, and sidewalk when necessary. In cases where a hard surface or drive which is adequate to support the combined full weight of the bulk container, the enclosure and service vehicles does not exist, a ten (10) foot wide hard surface extension directly in front of the bulk container shall be required for purposes of emptying the container. 
(7)  Garbage containers. All receptacles and bulk containers which receive garbage, liquid waste, or food from food handling operations, including, but not limited to, bakeries, meat processing plants, or any business establishment where it is determined that garbage, liquid waste, or food will be accumulated, shall have a raised concrete slab, a drain, and cleaning water facilities for said receptacles and containers and be constructed in accordance with the provisions of the Florida Building Code as may be amended. 
(8)  Maintenance. Approved enclosures shall be maintained in good condition and appearance at all times. Gates and latches shall be kept fully operable and shall be closed except during schedules collection periods. Enclosures and containers shall be cleaned periodically to prevent noxious odors and unsanitary conditions from occurring. Enclosure pads and access drives shall be repaired or rebuilt whenever the pavement structure deteriorates.

Enclosures shall be constructed of walls or fences of wood or plastic lumber (finished), masonry units, (finished) concrete, earth berms, landscape screens or any combination of these elements, and shall be constructed in a manner described below in subparagraph (1) through (6) below. The material(s) used shall be compatible with those of adjacent or surrounding buildings or structures and may be used in any combination of the enclosure materials referenced above. Gates shall be constructed of opaque materials in the manner provided in subparagraph (E)(4), above. 
(1)  Wood lumber. Wood fences shall be of a durable species, incorporating architectural design features to enhance appearance, and of a quality and design that meet the following criteria: 
(a)  The wood is pressure-treated or has a finish that protects the wood from the elements; and 
(b)  Supporting in-ground posts are adequate to support the weight of the enclosure gate; and 
(c)  That the lumber be a minimum of nominal one inch by nominal six (6) inch boards and shall have a maximum spacing between boards of one inch; and 
(d)  Compatibility of materials with existing materials on the subject property and the surrounding neighborhood, as determined by the Director. 
(2)  Plastic lumber. Lumber shall be plastic members of new or recycled materials able to withstand the climatic and ultraviolet conditions of the region and of a quality and design that meets the following criteria: 
(a)  The material is coated or has a finish that protects the plastic from the elements; and 
(b)  Supporting in-ground posts are adequate to support the weight of the enclosure gate; and 
(c)  That the lumber be a minimum of nominal one inch by nominal six (6) inch boards and shall have a maximum spacing between boards of one inch; and 
(d)  Compatibility of materials with existing materials on subject property and the surrounding neighborhood, as determined by the Director. 
(3)  Masonry and concrete walls. All exterior faces of walls shall be finished with two (2) coats of cement stucco, painted to match adjacent buildings. 
(4)  Earth berms. Landscaped earth berms shall have slopes no greater than 2:1. Such earth mounding may be used in combination with other materials or methods of construction to achieve the required height to accomplish proper screening and may be used to cover the visible exterior surface of any enclosure. 
(5)  Landscape enclosures. The use of evergreen or nonexfoliating landscaping shrubs as an enclosure shall be permitted under the following conditions: 
(a)  The container to be enclosed is no more than four (4) feet in height; and 
(b)  The landscape material is supported on the interior side by a dark colored, vinyl coated, commercial grade (9 gauge) chain link fence or by an uncoated galvanized chain link fence with dark colored, stiff high density, virgin polyethylene with ultra violet inhibitors. Vertical inserts shall be installed and fastened or locked into place on those enclosures which can be seen from the adjacent public right-of-way or from windows or door openings in all adjacent residential buildings. The chain link fence shall have a matching top rail that shall be a minimum of one and five-eighth (1 5/8 ) inches, grade one steel, in thickness; and 
(c)  The landscape enclosure and chain link fence shall be installed and maintained at a minimum height of six (6) inches above the highest point of the dumpster and all shrubs shall comply with minimum requirements set forth in Article 150, Landscaping. 
(G)  Location and screening requirements. One or more of the following provisions may apply to enclosures: 
(1)  Existing required landscape areas. The enclosure and access drive to a bulk container may encroach into the existing required landscape areas, if it is shown that it is necessary to provide adequate space for the enclosure and access drive. Such enclosures shall be landscaped so as to form a visual barrier between the enclosure and the street and adjoining property. 
(2)  Shared between abutting properties. Enclosures for one or more containers may be located along or across abutting property lines, and may serve two (2) or more adjacent properties, if affected property owners enter into a joint use agreement. Such joint use agreements shall be approved by the City and recorded in the public records of Broward County, Florida. If the joint use agreement is terminated, each property owner shall make separate provisions for their solid waste disposal and provide for the required screening between properties. 
(3)  Within parking areas. Enclosures may be located within or immediately adjacent to parking areas, regardless of building setback lines and shall be landscaped. Such landscaping may be reduced, as the enclosure is located toward the rear or low visibility areas of the property away from the public streets, as long as a continuous visual barrier between the enclosure and the street is maintained. Applicants shall be permitted to reduce in size up to twenty (20) existing parking spaces from the standard nine (9) foot width to eight (8) feet, six (6) inches in width, or eliminate one space if shown to be necessary to provide space for the enclosure, which determination shall be made by the Director. The overall parking ratio for residential properties, however, shall not be reduced below one space for each dwelling unit. 
(4)  Within yards. Enclosures may be located within building setback areas pursuant to Subsection 5, and the enclosure shall be fully landscaped. The landscaping may be reduced if the enclosure is located toward the rear of the property or in an area which is not highly visible from public streets as long as a continuous visual barrier between the enclosure and the street is maintained and the enclosure is adequately screened from any adjacent residential property. If the enclosure is located within a highly visible area within the building setback area, additional landscaping, architectural treatments or both, in addition to a visual barrier, may be required on the site as determined by the Director. The additional landscaping, architectural treatments or both shall be required to the extent it is found necessary to mitigate the impact of the location of the bulk container and enclosure on the site. 
(5)  In compliance with setbacks. Enclosures located in compliance with setbacks shall be required to be fully landscaped when the enclosure is freestanding on a property in a high visibility location from the right-of-way. Such landscaping may be reduced, as the enclosure is located toward the rear or low visibility areas of the property away from the public streets, as long as a continuous visual barrier between the enclosure and the street is maintained. 
(H)  Camouflage/alternate screening. In locations where sufficient space does not exist to allow construction of a bulk container enclosure and the provisions of the Section have been met where possible, the Director may determine that no other trash management option as described in this Section is reasonably available, and approve the application for a decorative veneer (camouflage) or other alternate screening method which may include conditions in lieu of enclosure construction. Such application and approval shall be conditioned so that there are no company identification/advertising logos on the veneer surface, the veneer is painted or stained a color compatible with the character and appearance of surrounding properties and the main building on the site, and the bulk container is placed upon a concrete pad the purpose of which is to ensure that the bulk container is positioned such that it is not an aesthetic detriment to the community. Applications to the Department shall contain the following documentation: 
(1)  A site plan or survey detailing the location and dimensions of buildings, the number and location of living units, lot size, landscaping on site (sod, trees, shrubs, etc.), the number and location of parking spaces, the location, service frequency, and capacity of the existing and proposed bulk refuse containers, and the type, nature, and application methodology of the veneer surfacing for each container or alternate screening or enclosure materials, including a description of how the alternate screening meets the purpose and intent of this Section; and 
(2)  A typewritten narrative of alternate trash management options considered or available and the reasons why those options are not suitable or desirable for the location in question. 
(I)  City liability. The City claims the exemption or exclusion afforded by any law of Florida now effective or hereafter enacted, which provides immunity to municipal officials and employees from actions for trespass, whether civil or criminal in nature.

( Ord. No. 2017-008 , § 4, 1-9-18) 
Sec. 055-050. - Shared use of communication antennas. 
(A)  Except to the extent prohibited by the Spectrum Act, as amended, to minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of telecommunication towers, co-location of facilities on existing or new towers shall be encouraged by: 
(1)  Only issuing permits to qualified shared facilities at locations where it appears there may be more demand for towers than the property can reasonably accommodate; or 
(2)  Giving preference to qualified shared facilities over other facilities in authorizing use at particular locations. 
(B)  For a facility to become a "qualified shared facility," the facility owner must show that: 
(1)  The facility is appropriately designed for sharing; and 
(2)  The facility owner is prepared to offer adequate space on the facility to others on fair and reasonable, nondiscriminatory terms. 
(C)  To satisfy the requirements of subsection (B)(1) of this section, the facility owner must submit a written evaluation of the structural capacity of the tower. 
(D)  The requirements of subsection (B)(1) of this section will be deemed to have been met if the facility owner shows that it has executed a joint use agreement with at least one other unaffiliated entity for shared use, and agrees to offer a similar contract to others. In other cases, the facility owner must enter into an agreement with the City, acceptable to the City, to offer space on fair, reasonable, nondiscriminatory terms, at fair market value, and to negotiate leases promptly and without undue delay. A condition of any permit for a qualified shared facility shall be that the permit shall be terminated, and the facility removed, if the City finds that the facility owner is not complying with its obligations under this Section and associated agreements with the City. 
(E)  Co-location of communication antennas by more than one provider on existing or new telecommunication towers shall take precedence over the construction of new single-use telecommunication towers. Accordingly, each application for a telecommunication tower shall include the following: 
(1)  A written evaluation of the feasibility of sharing a telecommunication tower, if an appropriate telecommunication tower or towers is/are available. The evaluation shall analyze one or more of the following factors: 
a.  Structural capacity of the tower or towers; 
b.  Radio frequency interference; 
c.  Geographical service area requirements; 
d.  Mechanical or electrical incompatibility; 
e.  Inability or ability to locate equipment on the tower or towers; 
f.  Availability of towers for co-location; 
g.  Any restrictions or limitations of the Federal Communications Commission that would preclude the shared use of the tower; 
h.  Additional information requested by the City. 
(2)  The City may deny an application if an available co-location is feasible and the application is not for such co-location. 
(F)  A telecommunication tower that is determined to be inappropriate for sharing shall be assumed to be inappropriate for sharing the same types of facilities in the future. Such towers will not need to be evaluated in the future regarding sharing with the same type of facility for which it has been determined to be inappropriate. The Department shall retain a list of such towers, and will provide a copy of the list to all potential applicants. The City may require additional sharing feasibility evaluations if warranted by changes in technology. 
(G)  For any telecommunications tower approved for shared use, the owner of the tower shall provide notice of the location of the telecommunication tower and the tower's load capacity to all other providers. 
( Ord. No. 2017-008 , § 5, 1-9-18) 
Sec. 055-060. - Applications. 
(A)  The City shall act promptly on any application submitted in accordance with the provisions of this Article that are not subject to Section 055-070 of the ULDR. The reasons for rejecting any application filed under these provisions shall be explained, set forth in writing and based on substantial evidence. The rejection of an application under this Article does not prevent a person from filing an application for a special exception in accordance with applicable law. 
(B)  The issuance of a permit, however, is not a lease and no municipally owned property may be used without a lease agreement with the City. The City may, as appropriate to protect its property and the public interest, establish additional requirements beyond the minimum requirements of a permit for municipally owned property. This provision further does not preclude the City from issuing a letter of interest for the purposes of leasing sites on designated City property for the construction and installation of personal wireless service facilities. For designated neighborhood parks, the City will encourage the installation of facilities that have a minimal impact on the surrounding areas and are consistent with the development of the park.

PART 3 - DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS 
ARTICLE 60. - REQUIRED PERMITS AND APPROVALS 

Sec. 060-010. - Generally. 
    The purpose of this Article is to guide the processing and granting of development review applications in a manner consistent with the City of Wilton Manors Comprehensive Plan, existing development, and in a manner which protects the public health, safety and welfare. The omission of a particular permit from this list shall not affect the necessity for obtaining such a permit where otherwise required by law. One or more of the following permits and approvals, also called development orders, are required for the use or development of land, as indicted: 
(A)  Certificate of occupancy. Required prior to the occupation of any building, structure or part thereof for which a building permit is issued, and for changes of occupancy pursuant to the Florida Building Code. No new building or structure shall be used or occupied subsequent to construction, alteration or change of occupancy class as provided by the Florida Building Code unless and until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the Department. 
(B)  Building permit, site improvement permit. Generally required for development pertaining to buildings, structures and infrastructure. Building permits are required pursuant to the Florida Building Code. The building or site improvement permit and certificate of occupancy represent the last point in the development review process. All other approvals, permits and certificates required by this Article must be applied for and obtained before an application for such permits may be considered for approval by the City. Applications for building permits shall be consistent with all previous approvals, including but not limited to, the site plan, plat, and conditional use approvals. No development shall occur until and unless the Department has issued a building or site improvement permit for that development. 
(C)  Certificate or determination of compliance. Required prior to issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy in the absence of a building permit, to ensure that every use and development of land complies with the standards of these regulations and the adopted Comprehensive Plan. It is anticipated that in most instances, determinations of compliance will be made simultaneously with review and approval of the application for development approval; however, there may be situations where a separate certificate is desirable. When desired, a compliance certificate constitutes an official statement that the proposed development or modification of existing development complies with these regulations and constitutes a basis for issuance of a building permit if no other development approval is required. Issuance of a compliance certificate shall not be construed to exempt the applicant from obtaining a Level of Service Determination. 
(D)  Determination of level of service compliance. Required for all development or any change in use that is subject to the public facility concurrency requirements of F.S. Chapter 163, pertaining to impact on water, sewer, drainage, and recreation and open space infrastructure.

ARTICLE 80. - CONCURRENCY AND IMPACT FEES 

Sec. 080-010. - Purpose. 
    This Article is intended to ensure that development is consistent with the Level of Service standards for public facilities which are contained in the Comprehensive Plan and this Article and to prevent the issuance of development orders which result in a reduction in the level of services below the levels provided in the Comprehensive Plan. 
Sec. 080-020. - Applicability. 
(A)  Development subject to adequacy determination. The following development shall be subject to an adequacy determination unless otherwise exempted: 
(1)  For plats or replats, or for site plans or building permits where the property is unplatted or was platted, with plat approval received before March 20, 1979, all development of previously vacant land shall be subject to adequacy determination unless a site plan has been approved prior to November 1, 1989, and development activity has occurred on the site. 
(2)  For plats or replats, or for site plans or building permits in the City of Wilton Manors where the property is unplatted or was platted, with plat approval received before March 20, 1979, all development of previously improved lands shall be subject to an adequacy determination for the additional capacity that equals the difference between the capacity to be generated or consumed by the development specified in site plan, building permit or proposed note on the plat, and the capacity generated or consumed by the existing development. Existing development shall be construed to include previous development demolished no earlier than eighteen (18) months previous to the date the final plat is submitted, or the application for a site plan or building permit approval is submitted. 
(3)  For a replat, or an amendment to a note on a plat, or a requirement to place a note on a plat, where property was platted after March 20, 1979, an adequacy determination shall be required for those additional capacities that equal the difference between the previous plat and the replat; or the previous note in the proposed amendment to the note; or the development approved by the County Commission at the time of plat approval and the proposed note to be placed on the plat. 
(4)  All plats approved after October 1, 1989, by the Broward County Commission and all development permits (i.e. site plans) approved after November 1, 1989, by the City of Wilton Manors must undergo adequacy determinations of concurrency. 
(B)  No development order or permit shall be granted unless the applicant first obtains a Determination of Level of Service Compliance pursuant to subparagraph (A), where required, unless one of the one of the following exemptions applies: 
(1)  Development orders or rights determined to be vested pursuant to a judicial determination or pursuant to a "Vested Rights Determination" of the City Commission as described in Section 005-100 of these regulations; or 
(2)  A valid and approved Development Order which was final as of November 14, 1989, under the provisions of F.S. Chapter 380; or 
(3)  Single family dwellings on lots which were of record as of April 10, 1989 (the date of adoption of the Comprehensive Plan) shall not be required to obtain a Determination of Level of Service but shall be required to obtain a Certificate of Compliance and other permits required by these regulations or other applicable regulations; or 
(4)  The proposed development is a government facility which the Wilton Manors City Commission finds is essential to the public health, safety or welfare. 
(Ord. No. 848, 10-14-03) 
Sec. 080-030. - Presumption of maximum impact. 
(A)  For the purpose of implementing this Article, a proposed development shall be presumed to have the maximum impact permitted under applicable land development regulations in the absence of a complete site development plan application, deed or plat restrictions. 
(B)  If an application for a building permit provides for more intensive use than that indicated when the LOS determination was made, the application shall be reevaluated for concurrency. 
Sec. 080-040. - Standards. 
(A)  The Director shall not issue a Determination of Level of Service Compliance for any development unless determining that planned and committed improvements have sufficient capacity to provide the adopted Level of Service for all existing, permitted projects and the proposed development. Except as further defined below, the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by: 
(1)  Adding together: 
a.  The total capacity of existing facilities; and 
b.  The total capacity of new facilities that will become available concurrent with the impact of development. The capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one or more of the following is shown: 
1.  The necessary facilities are in place at the time a development order is issued, or a plat or site plan are approved subject to the condition that the necessary facilities will be in place when the impacts of development occur. 
2.  Construction of the new facilities is under way at the time of the application. 
3.  The new facilities are the subject of a binding, executed contract for the construction of the facilities to be constructed within a period of time as stipulated in the contract, or the provision of services at the time the development permit is issued. 
4.  The new facilities have been included in either the City of Wilton Manors or Broward County capital improvement program annual budgets. 
5.  The new facilities are guaranteed at a specific time in an enforceable development agreement. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, as may be amended from time to time, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. Chapter 380. Such facilities must be consistent with the capital improvements element of the City's Comprehensive Plan and approved by the City and/or County Engineer, as applicable. 
6.  The developer has contributed funds to the City and/or County, as necessary to provide new facilities consistent with the capital improvements element of the City and/or County Comprehensive Plan. Commitment that the facilities will be built must be evidenced by an appropriate budget amendment and appropriation by the City and/or County or other government entity. 
(2)  Subtracting from that number the sum of: 
a.  The design demand for the service created by existing development; and 
b.  The new design demand for the service (by phase or otherwise) that will be created concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development by the anticipated completion of other presently approved developments.

Any conditions of plat approval shall pertain to the review criteria within this Section. The City shall approve street names for all new streets within the plat. City Commission approval shall be by resolution. 
(B)  Review criteria. City's review will include: 
(1)  Consistency with the goals, objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan; 
(2)  Compliance with the ULDR and engineering requirements; 
(3)  Street width, arrangement and location; 
(4)  Surface drainage; 
(5)  Requirements for parks, school sites and public building sites; 
(6)  Consideration for the future development of adjoining lands as yet unsubdivided, including adequacy of street connections to ensure free access to, and circulation for, adjoining subdivisions and lands; 
(7)  Access locations; 
(8)  Water supply, sewage disposal. 
(C)  Improvement Plan. 
(1)  Submission of improvements plan. After City approval of the plat, the developer shall submit to the City's Engineer ten copies of the proposed improvement plans. 
(2)  Modification of design of improvements. If at any time before or during the construction of the required improvements it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that unforeseen conditions make it necessary or preferable to modify the location or design of such required improvements, the City's Engineer may, upon approval by the City Manager, require modifications provided these modifications are within the spirit and intent of the City Commission's approval and do not extend to the waiver or substantial alteration of the function of any improvements required by the City. The City Engineer shall issue any authorization under this Section in writing, sending a copy to the Director. 
(D)  Improvements and guarantees. 
(1)  Prior to issuance of any engineering permits, and any engineering work by the City on behalf of the developer, the developer shall deposit with the City a cash bond equal to ten (10) per cent of the estimated cost of construction of all improvements based on a preliminary estimate computed by the City Engineer. The City shall deduct from the ten (10) per cent bond the cost of services performed by City personnel for the benefit of the developer, including administration, plat review, engineering, inspection, legal, testing, borings and/or corings, and financing costs deemed necessary by the City's Engineer. The cash bond shall also be held to guarantee payment by the developer of monthly invoices covering the actual cost to the City of any engineering design and inspection of water and sewer facilities constructed by the developer or by the City for the developer. Invoices unpaid for more than one month shall be cause for discontinuance of engineering and Inspection services. 
(2)  Prior to the City's second and final plat signoff subsequent to Commission approval and prior to recording, the developer shall post a surety bond or other acceptable security with the City in the amount of one hundred (100) per cent of the final estimated cost of construction of all required improvements, including roads, drainage, curb and gutter, sidewalks, and water and sewer utilities, based on a final estimate computed by the City Engineer to guarantee that the improvements shall be made in accordance with plans and specifications. The bond shall be subject to the approval of the City Attorney. 
(3)  Upon completion of all improvements covered by the approved improvement plans, all remaining funds in the ten (10) per cent cash bond shall be returned to the developer. When improvements are completed or partially completed prior to consideration of a final plat by the City Commission, the improvement bond amount shall be for only the uncompleted portion of the planned improvements and utilities. Upon completion and acceptance by the City of all improvements, the bond or other acceptable security may be reduced to ten (10) per cent of the original surety bond and be continued for a period of one year from the date of acceptance to cover latent defects. 
(4)  Inspection of improvements. At least five (5) days prior to commencing construction of required improvements the developer shall notify the City Engineer in writing of the proposed time for construction of such improvements so that the City Engineer may cause inspection to be made to assure that all City specifications and requirements shall be met during the construction of required improvements, and to assure the satisfactory completion of improvements and utilities required by the City Commission. 
(5)  Proper installation of improvements. Failure of a developer to construct any required improvements in accordance with approved plans and specifications may result in the developer's forfeiture of the bonds or other security provided. No plat shall be approved by the City Commission as long as the subdivider is in substantial default on a previously approved Plat. 
(6)  At each annual renewal of public performance bonds, the City shall make a determination if the bonds shall be drawn upon for construction.

    The adopted Zoning Map and Future Land Use Plan Map of the City may be amended from time to time in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in this Section. The purpose of this Section is not to relieve particular hardships, nor to confer special privileges or rights on any person, but only to make adjustments to the zoning and/or Land Use Plan Map designations of land that are appropriate in light of the standards of review set forth in this Article. A predominant consideration in all Zoning Map amendments is consistency with the adopted Comprehensive Plan. In some cases, amendment of the Zoning Map may require amendment of the Comprehensive Plan. 
Sec. 100-020. - Supplemental application requirements. 
    Land Use Plan Map amendment applications. The application requirements of Article 65, which include the requirement for a preapplication conference, shall be supplemented by the information required by the Broward County Land Use Plan Administrative Rules Document for amendments to the County Land Use Plan and an analysis of the application's consistency with the Comprehensive Plan. 
Sec. 100-030. - Application processing. 
(A)  Development Review Committee. The Development Review Committee shall review applications for map amendments as determined by the Director, and make a recommendation to the PZB.

(C)  City Commission review: In the event the PZB recommendation is to deny the request, the City Clerk shall take no action unless requested by the applicant via written notice. Upon receipt of written notice of intent to proceed to City Commission, the Clerk shall advertise the application for public hearing. The City Commission shall establish a public hearing to consider public testimony, and the staff and PZB recommendations, and shall take action on the application. Rezonings shall be subject to the public hearing procedures of Article 75 for quasi-judicial hearings unless otherwise provided by law. 
(D)  Approval of map amendments shall be by ordinance. 
(E)  Whenever the City Commission has acted upon an application for rezoning of property, whether approved or denied, the PZB shall not thereafter consider any further application for rezoning of any part of the same property for a period of one year from the date the previous application was denied, or the date the ordinance rezoning the property became effective. The City Commission may waive this time limit by a majority vote when the City Commission deems the waiver necessary to prevent injustice or to facilitate the proper development of the City. 
(F)  A change in zoning makes no explicit or implied guarantees that services or facilities are available to serve the proposed development at the time of rezoning. 
(G)  Typographical or drafting errors. Notwithstanding any other provisions set forth above, amendments to correct typographical or drafting errors upon the Official Zoning Map may be adopted by the City Commission at a regular meeting.

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 875, § 2, adopted Aug. 23, 2005, repealed art. 135, §§ 135-010-135-070, in its entirety. Section 3(Exh. A), of said ordinance provided for a new art. 135 to read as herein set out. Formerly, said article pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for a detailed analysis of inclusion. 

Sec. 135-010. - Purpose. 
    To achieve the purposes of the ULDR and of the Code of the City of Wilton Manors, Florida, and provide for the safety of pedestrians and motorists, the orderly movement of people, vehicles and goods and maintaining the public ways, it is necessary that regulations be established requiring facilities and space for the off-street parking of vehicles in the City. The off-street parking regulations specific to any zoning or overlay zoning district shall supersede the corresponding regulations of this article. All other provisions of this article shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 875, § 3(Exh. A), 8-23-05) 
Sec. 135-020. - Design standards. 
    Off-street parking areas shall be designed to ensure safe and efficient traffic circulation, with consideration given to the surrounding street plan, traffic volumes, proposed street improvements, vehicular street capacities, pedestrian movements and safety. The parking facilities shall be of sufficient size and configuration to allow necessary functions for loading, unloading and parking maneuvers to be carried out on private property, and completely off the street right-of-way, unless otherwise specifically permitted. 
(A)  Parking space definition. An off-street parking space is an all-weather surfaced area not in a street or alley and having a width of not less than nine (9) feet and a length of not less than twenty (20) feet, except as otherwise provided below, exclusive of driveways, which space is permanently reserved for the temporary storage of one private passenger motor vehicle and is connected with a street or alley by an all-weather surfaced driveway which affords ingress and egress for an automobile without requiring another automobile to be moved or otherwise requiring access over or through any other parking space, except as provided below. 
(1)  A driveway, as well as a garage or carport that meet the dimensional requirements of this provision may be counted as off-street parking spaces for detached single-family homes, irregardless of the need to move one automobile in order to afford ingress and egress for another automobile. 
(2)  A garage or carport, and a driveway servicing a garage or carport, that meet the dimensional requirements of this provision, may be counted as off-street parking spaces for attached single-family homes, duplex and townhome units to which the garage or carport is attached, regardless of the need to move one automobile in order to afford ingress and egress for another automobile. For a duplex providing on-street parking for one unit pursuant to section 135-050, on-street parking credit, a driveway with stacked spaces may be utilized to provide parking for the second unit. 
(3)  Handicap parking spaces shall measure twelve (12) feet by twenty (20) feet with a five (5) foot paved accessway, except that where two (2) handicap spaces abut each other, they may jointly use the paved accessway. 
(4)  The length of a parking space may be reduced to eighteen (18) feet, provided the vehicle overhang area forward of the wheelstop or curb required under subsection 135-120(B) comprising the otherwise required twenty (20) foot parking space length is covered with grass or an approved ground cover. The overhang area shall not count towards the minimum width requirement for median landscape islands or perimeter landscape buffers for vehicular use areas, nor shall it count towards required landscape area, or for required pervious area. 
(5)  Standard off-street parallel parking space shall measure ten (10) feet by twenty-three (23) feet. Handicap parallel parking spaces shall measure twelve (12) feet by twenty-three (23) feet with a five (5) foot paved accessway. 
(B)  Siting of parking facilities. Parking areas shall be located so as to minimize conflicting movements between vehicles maneuvering in parking aisles and those vehicles traveling into, out of, or through the site. Unless specifically excepted in this article, individual parking spaces shall not have direct access to streets. Off-street parking spaces shall be located to the greatest extent possible in side and rear yard locations. 
(C)  Entrances and exits. Location and design of entrances and exits shall be located and designed in accordance with City specifications, as set forth in the minimum engineering standards adopted by the City Commission to prevent congestion, confusion and conflicts between vehicles and to prevent conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles. Improvements not addressed in the City's adopted specifications must conform to "A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets," published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ("AASHTO Geometric Highway Design") or a "Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices," published by the US Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, as determined by the City Manager. 
(D)  Parking aisles. 
(1)  Parking aisles shall be of adequate width to serve a particular design arrangement of parking spaces in accordance with the following table, and shall also comply with the minimum dimensions of the subsections following the table: 
Parking Angles (degrees) Aisle Width 
(in feet) 45 16 50 16 60 19 70 20 75 23 80 24 90 24  
Note: Dimensions are for one lane, one-way direction movement except for ninety (90) degree parking, which may be two-way direction movement. 
(2)  Two-way directional and two (2) lane, one-way directional movement require a minimum aisle of twenty-four (24) feet regardless of parking angle. 
(3)  If a parking aisle requires access for emergency vehicles, garbage trucks or trucks moving to or from a loading area, that parking aisle shall be at least twenty-four (24) feet wide. 
(4)  Parking stalls abutting the same continuous parking aisle shall have the same angle and orientation. Parking aisles less than twenty-four (24) feet wide and aisles abutting parking stalls with angles of less than ninety (90) degrees, shall be one-way only. Parking stall angles and parking aisle direction of flow may change only when the parking aisle is interrupted by a circulation drive, structure, or landscape median or similar feature. 
(5)  All required parking stalls shall have direct and unobstructed access from a parking aisle. 
(6)  When a row of parking stalls is immediately adjacent to a driveway, a minimum stacking area of twenty-five (25) feet is required between the property line and the entrance to the first stall. 
(7)  Dead-end parking aisles are prohibited, except where a double-loaded dead-end aisle serves fewer than twenty-one (21) parking spaces and a turnaround area is provided that will accommodate a three (3) point turnaround, or where the number of parking spaces in the double-loaded dead-end aisle is ten (10) or fewer (AASHTO "P" Design Vehicle). 
(E)  Interior drives. On-site access drives that do not directly abut parking spaces shall be provided as follows: 
(1)  For two-way travel: A minimum of twenty (20) feet in width shall be provided. 
(2)  For one-way travel: A minimum of twelve (12) feet in width shall be provided unless a greater width is required by the Fire Marshal where needed for emergency vehicle access. 
(3)  Every off-street parking facility shall have either driveway approaches of sufficient width to allow for two-way traffic, or one-way driveways connected to aisles, parking areas or maneuvering areas in such a manner as to permit traffic to both enter and leave the property, facing forward, at the same time. A driveway which is only wide enough for one-way traffic shall not be used for two-way access. 
(4)  For both one and two-way driveways, required widths shall be increased if necessary to accommodate vehicle types that will utilize the driveways pursuant to subsection (F), access, or if the number of parking stalls connected or the number of trips generated justifies such an increase in width. 
(5)  Minimum access width dimensions at the street: 
a.  Minimum (one-way): Fifteen (15) feet. 
b.  Minimum (two-way): Twenty-five (25) feet. 
c.  Maximum: Thirty-five (35) feet, unless otherwise required under subparagraph (4), above. 
(6)  Turn radii shall be determined according to (F), below based upon access requirements for specific user vehicle types. The minimum acceptable turn radius shall be ten (10) feet, and the maximum acceptable turn radius shall be thirty (30) feet, provided that the Fire Marshal may determine that a greater radius than ten (10) feet is required where necessary for emergency vehicle access. 
(F)  Access. 
(1)  All required parking areas shall be directly accessible from a street, or for small parking facilities, an alley. 
(2)  Access for vehicles other than automobiles. Parking facilities shall be made accessible to the following type of vehicles, definitions of and required specifications of which, shall be those found in AASHTO Geometric Highway Design. 
a.  Residential uses, other than single family: Single unit truck (SU)

(G)  Circulation. 
(1)  Vehicular circulation. A parking lot abutting a collector or arterial roadway shall be designed for full on-site circulation. A parking lot abutting any other street or alley may be designed for partial circulation. Parking facility design shall provide for a clearly defined vehicular circulation system, which allows free movement within the proposed site while discouraging excessive speed, and allows efficient and orderly circulation that minimizes congestion. 
(2)  Pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems shall be adequately separated for pedestrian safety (see also section 155-080, pedestrian circulation). 
(3)  For nonresidential and mixed-use development on collector and arterial roadways, driveways, accessways and access aisles shall be interconnected with existing driveways, accessways, and access aisles in parking areas on abutting developed properties, and a cross-access easement shall be provided for this purpose. Where abutting properties are developed in such a manner that such interconnection is physically impossible, or where such connection would compromise safe and adequate circulation or cause an existing property to become nonconforming due to loss of parking or landscaped area, no connection shall be required. 
(H)  Minimum separations. Residential and nonresidential driveways and parking aisles shall be at least five (5) feet from any building, structure and property line, provided that other requirements including landscape buffers and on-site drainage may require additional setback. 
(I)  Attendant parking. In the case of buildings wherein the owner's supply and maintain the services of attendants to receive, park and deliver the automobile of occupants, tenants, customers and visitors, with or without charge, the required minimum width of each parking space shall be eight and one-half (81/2) feet, except that wherever a supporting column of a building falls within a proposed parking space, there shall be a minimum clearance of eight (8) feet measured from the supporting column to the furthest edge of the parking space. All spaces need not be directly accessible provided the parking spaces are arranged that for any parking space to be accessible, no more than two (2) spaces may be crossed into when parking a motor vehicle. Such reductions in parking space width and change in accessibility shall be authorized under the following conditions, to wit: 
(1)  Permission for such attendant parking shall be evidenced by an attendant off-street parking agreement recorded in the Public Records of Broward County, Florida, showing the required attendant parking spaces to be maintained, which restriction shall be deemed a covenant running with the land. 
(2)  After completed construction based upon approved plans and specifications providing for such attendant parking, areas designated for attendant parking shall not be used without providing the service of attendants. 
(J)  Backout parking. 
(1)  No parking space, other than as specifically provided in subsection 135-020(A) for stacked parking, shall be designed to permit backout parking onto a public right-of-way or private street, other than a dedicated alley, except residential uses under the following circumstances: 
a.  The backout parking is on a roadway not classified as an arterial or collector roadway, as defined in the adopted Comprehensive Plan; and 
b.  A minimum five (5) foot wide sidewalk is installed parallel to the street where the backout parking is located, which sidewalk meets City standards. The sidewalk requirement may be eliminated or a sidewalk wider than five (5) feet may be required by the City Manager if necessary for consistency with sidewalk improvements on adjacent properties, City Capital Improvement or Redevelopment Plans, superceding Code provisions, or to meet engineering standards; and 
c.  The material used for the entire parking space and driveway apron surface shall be brick-type pavers, or stamped and colored, or painted, concrete designed to imitate brick-type pavers. Each property owner shall be responsible for maintaining, repairing and replacing, as necessary, all portions of the backout parking facility, including that portion located within the public right-of-way; and 
d.  The backout parking spaces must meet geometric, drainage and site clearance standards and such other standards determined to be necessary to provide adequate and safe parking as determined by the City Manager; and 
e.  Every backout parking facility shall provide curbed landscape areas in accordance with subsection 150-060(G), Landscaping requirements for residential backout parking; and 
f.  Off-street parking spaces shall be designed so as not to require backing out onto or across a pedestrian way or area designed or used for high pedestrian concentration.

Sec. 135-040. - Alternative parking generation standards. 
(A)  The Director may approve a parking and/or stacking space needs analysis justifying an alternative parking generation rate(s) or stacking space requirement provided by a petitioner for development approval or change of use, if such alternate rate or requirement is the result of unique operating characteristics of the proposed use or mix of uses, if there are distinctions between the parking and/or stacking space demand generated by the proposed use(s) and the parking and/or stacking space standard(s) for the most similar use(s) contained in this article, or where the petitioner produces recent, professionally acceptable data and analysis demonstrating that an alternate parking generation rate and/or stacking space requirement is more appropriate for a class of use than that contained in this article. 
(B)  A parking and/or stacking space needs analysis shall include one or more of the following, as applicable, to support the needs analysis: 
(1)  Estimates of parking and/or stacking space needs based on recommendations in studies such as those from the Urban Land Institute, Institute of Traffic Engineers, or industry standards based on data collected from geographic areas and uses or combinations of uses that are similar to the proposed uses(s). The analysis shall document the source of the data used to develop particular recommendations. 
(2)  Actual parking and/or stacking space counts for the development indicating that the full complement of parking spaces and/or stacking spaces is not required. Such parking and/or stacking counts shall be taken during peak demand parking and drive-thru hours. 
(3)  An analysis of the extent to which other parking options exist that would lessen on-site parking requirements. 
(4)  An operational procedure indicating that the full complement of parking and/or stacking spaces is not required and a guarantee of continuity of such operational procedure. 
(C)  The parking and/or stacking needs analysis shall include a statement of remedies in the event the City makes a future determination that the full complement of parking and/or stacking is required. If for any reason a traffic impact statement is required, the parking needs analysis shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the traffic impact statement. In the event that a needs analysis is approved and the City makes a future determination that insufficient parking and/or stacking spaces exist, the property owner shall be notified by certified mail that a remedy shall be implemented within sixty (60) days. A determination of insufficiency shall be made using one or more of the following methods: monitoring of the parking/stacking; increased parking/stacking in the rights-of-way caused by insufficient off-street parking and/or stacking on the site; or, verified complaints of parking on neighboring properties by employees or visitors of the property in question. 
(D)  The petitioner shall execute a parking agreement with the City pursuant to the procedures specified in subsection 135-030(C), setting forth the terms of the alternative parking and/or stacking generation standard, which may require recalculation based upon changes to the business operation, and/or other terms and conditions the City deems necessary to ensure the alternative parking and/or stacking calculation will remain appropriate. 
(E)  In order for any development to qualify for an alternative standard, the development must comply with all applicable architectural and urban design guidelines, and shall provide an additional twenty (20) per cent landscaping material on site, to be comprised of materials approved by the City. 
(Ord. No. 875, § 3(Exh. A), 8-23-05) 
Sec. 135-050. - On-street parking credit. 
    For City streets upon which chapter 19, article II permits on-street parking, the City may reduce the number of required off-street parking spaces for a site abutting such a street by the number of on-street spaces a developer provides under lease agreement with the City, subject to all of the following requirements: 
(A)  No on-street parking credit is permitted for single-family detached residences. 
(B)  Lot frontage must be a minimum of seventy-five (75) feet.

In residential zoning districts, no part of an on-street parking space shall extend past a side property line of the lot it serves, unless the on-street parking is planned to serve multiple properties, as approved by the City. A parking space abutting two (2) lots by more than twenty-five (25) per cent of its length on either lot shall count toward required parking for both lots in the case of business parking and planned residential parking serving multiple properties. 
(H)  On-street parking spaces provided under this section must be paved, striped and provide curb and gutter to City standards. Drainage improvements may be required per chapter 17, article II of the City of Wilton Manors Code of Ordinances. 
(I)  On-street parking spaces adjacent to a driveway entrance or the property line of a lot that does not have on-street spaces in front of it shall be separated from such property line or driveway and terminated by a landscape island with minimum dimensions of five (5) feet by width of space. Landscape islands shall also be provided every five (5) spaces, inclusive of those required above where adjacent to driveways and property lines. Landscaping within the islands shall be provided pursuant to section 150-060, landscaping in, or adjacent to, street right-of-way. 
(J)  Where the width of a swale on a local road, as defined in the adopted Comprehensive Plan, is not sufficient to accommodate the required width of a parallel parking space, up to two (2) feet of roadway surface on each side of the street may be used to accommodate parallel parking, provided the existing pavement width of the street is at least twenty-four (24) feet in width, providing a twenty (20) foot wide travel surface, and subject to City Manager approval. 
(K)  The City shall annually assess the property receiving credit for on-street parking for its use of the public right-of-way as specified in the lease agreement, which shall be recorded in the Public Records of Broward County and run with the land receiving the parking credit. The City Commission shall determine the amount to be assessed for each parking space by resolution, and may adjust the fee for new leases as it deems appropriate from time to time. The lease agreement shall stipulate penalties for failure to pay the assessment.

(A)  The parking required herein is in addition to space for storage of trucks or other vehicles used in connection with a business, commercial or industrial use. 
(B)  Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be construed to be the next highest number. 
(C)  The parking space requirements for a use not specifically listed in the article shall be the same as for a listed use of similar characteristics of parking demand generation. 
(D)  Whenever a building or use, is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of dwelling or rental sleeping units, seating capacity or otherwise, to create a requirement for an increase in the number of off-street parking spaces provided, off-street parking spaces as specified herein shall be provided for the additional floor area, dwelling units or capacity, except that when such change in use or increase in area or density would result in a requirement for more than a fifty (50) per cent increase in parking spaces to the existing off-street parking facilities, the entire premises shall be brought into full compliance with the requirements of this article as a condition of the issuance of any site plan approval, permit or license required for the change in use or enlargement. 
(E)  All parking facilities except those for single-family residences, shall be brought into compliance with the requirements of this article, to the extent physically possible without having to create or exacerbate nonconforming conditions upon the property, by the date(s) established by resolution of the City Commission pursuant to this provision. The City shall provide individual notice to each property owner that is affected by this provision at least one year before such resolution requires the property to comply with this provision. 
(F)  All references to floor area are net floor area inside the exterior walls. In determining net floor area for required parking calculations, the following are excluded: basements, uninhabited attics, garages, carports, screen-enclosed areas, terraces, balconies, colonnades, porches, decks, patios, water tank and cooling tower areas, elevator shafts, mechanical equipment areas, walkways, steps, stairwells, and accessory storage areas.

ARTICLE 145. - SIGNAGE REGULATIONS[6] 
Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 874, § 2, adopted Dec. 13, 2005, repealed Art. 145 in its entirety. Section 3 of said ordinance provided for a new Art. 145 to read as herein set out. Formerly, said article pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for a detailed analysis of inclusion. 

PART I. - PURPOSE, APPLICABILITY, INTERPRETATIONS AND DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 145-010. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare through reasonable, consistent and non-discriminatory sign standards. The sign regulations in this chapter are not intended to censor speech or to regulate viewpoints, but instead are intended to regulate the secondary effects of speech and especially insofar as those secondary effects may adversely affect aesthetics, traffic or pedestrian safety. The purposes of these sign regulations are: 
(A)  To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication for business, organizations and individuals in the City; 
(B)  To provide a means of way-finding in the community, thus reducing driver confusion and traffic congestion; 
(C)  To maintain and enhance the pleasing look of the City such that it is attractive to businesses, visitors, and residents; 
(D)  To lessen the visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation, excessive height, and excessive size (area) of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic; 
(E)  To curtail the size and number of signs and sign messages to the minimum reasonably necessary to identify a residential or business location and the nature of any such business; 
(F)  To improve pedestrian and traffic safety; 
(G)  To differentiate among those signs that, because of their location, may distract drivers in active traffic and those that may provide information to them while they remain in their cars but out of active traffic; 
(H)  To protect property values by precluding to the maximum extent possible sign types that create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other properties as a result of their size, height, illumination, brightness, or movement; 
(I)  To minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property; 
(J)  To establish sign size in relationship to the scale of the lot and building on which the sign is to be placed or to which it pertains; 
(K)  To implement the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan, as updated from time to time; and 
(L)  To enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations. 
(Ord. No. 874, § 3(Exh. A), 12-13-05) 
Sec. 145-020. - Applicability and effect. 
(A)  Applicability. A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created, altered, or maintained on public or private property in the City only in conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions, and other requirements of this Article. Certain zoning districts contain their own signage regulations that are unique to the applicable district. Where the provisions of this Article conflict with the signage provisions contained within any zoning district, the signage regulations of the specific zoning district will prevail to the extent of such conflict. 
(B)  Effect. The effect of this Article, as more specifically set forth herein, is: 
(1)  To establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in commercial, industrial and some mixed-use zoning districts, and a limited variety of signs in other zoning districts, subject to the standards and the permit procedures of this Article; 
(2)  To allow certain signs, based upon their function, small size, and unobtrusive nature, subject to the substantive requirements of this Article, but without a requirement for a City sign permit; 
(3)  To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances; 
(4)  To prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this Article; and 
(5)  To provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this Article. 
(C)  Transitional provisions. 
(1)  Existing signs. All signs legally erected pursuant to a issued permit prior to the effective date of the ordinance adopting this Article ("Article") or any amendment hereto, may remain in place and in use, subject to certain restrictions on modification, replacement, and other actions affecting signs not in conformance with the provisions of this Article, as set forth in Section 145-180, Nonconforming signs. 
(2)  Existing permits. All holders of permits for signs issued legally prior to the effective date of this Article, or any amendment hereto, may erect the signs which are the subject of such permits within the times allowed by such permits, and such signs shall then be treated as though they had been erected prior to the effective date of this Article. However, such permits may not be extended or amended unless the sign which is the subject of such permit will conform to all of the requirements of this Article as it exists at such time. 
(3)  Existing violations. All violations of the sign regulations repealed in favor of this Article shall remain violations of the ordinances of the City and all penalties and enforcement remedies set forth hereunder shall be available to the City as though the violation were a violation of this Article. However, if the effect of this Article is to make a sign that was formerly nonconforming become conforming, then enforcement action shall cease except to the extent of collecting penalties (other than removal of the sign) for violations that occurred prior to the effective date of this Article. 
(Ord. No. 874, § 3(Exh. A), 12-13-05) 
Sec. 145-030. - Interpretation and computation of sign area. 
(A)  Computation of sign area of individual signs. The area of a sign consists of the area within the perimeter of the sign faces. For signs composed of individual symbols, letters, figures, illustrations, graphics, messages, representations, emblems, forms or panels, sign area shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, or triangle, that will encompass the extreme limits of same. 
(B)  Computation of area of double-faced signs. 
(1)  The area of a double-faced sign with sign faces that are parallel or the interior angle of the two (2) faces is fifteen (15) degrees or less, shall be calculated using the area of only one sign face. 
(2)  The area of a double-faced sign with sign faces having an interior angle of more than fifteen (15) degrees shall be calculated using the area of both sign faces added together to determine the total area of a sign based on the principal that all sign elements that can be seen at one time, from one vantage point, shall be counted in measuring signage area. 
(3)  Signs with more than two (2) faces are prohibited. 
(C)  Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the vertical distance from the average elevation of the crown of the street(s) along the entire length of the property frontage upon which the sign is placed to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. 
(D)  Computations based upon frontage. Lots fronting on two (2) or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage. However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's total sign area allocation that is derived from the street or building wall frontage, as applicable, on that street. 
(E)  Determination of primary street frontage. In the event a property has multiple street frontages, and these regulations require the determination of a primary street frontage, the Director shall determine which constitutes the primary frontage based upon consideration of the following criteria: 
(1)  Arterial roadways generally constitute primary frontage; 
(2)  A roadway onto which a property has its vehicular access generally constitutes primary frontage as contrasted with a roadway onto which the property has no vehicular access; 
(3)  When one street frontage is at least twenty-five (25) per cent longer than another, it constitutes the primary street frontage provided criteria A. and B. do not indicate otherwise. 
(4)  If the Director believes the criteria above do not adequately provide guidance, the Director may take into account the nature of the vehicular access (i.e. full access versus right-in, right-out only), traffic volumes using each access point, and other considerations consistent with the intent of this provision, as established by the nature of the criteria contained herein and the intent and purpose of this Article. 
(5)  If warranted after careful consideration of the above criteria, the Director may find that it is not possible to determine the primary frontage, in which case the signage allowance for the primary frontage shall be permitted along all frontages satisfying the above criteria. 
(F)  Fractional measurements. Any calculation that results in a fractional measurement shall be rounded down to the next lowest whole number. For example, if one sign is allowed per one hundred (100) feet of street frontage and a lot has one hundred ninety (190) feet of street frontage, only one sign shall be permitted. 
(G)  Distance separations. Required distance between signs and other required distances shall be measured in a straight line using the shortest airline distance from the closest point of a sign to the closest point of another sign or feature for which the separation is required.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any permanent sign erected pursuant to the provisions of this Article may, at the option of the owner, contain either a non-commercial message unrelated to the business located on the premises where the sign is erected or a lawful commercial message (i.e. On-Premises). The noncommercial message may occupy the entire sign face or any portion thereof. The sign face may be changed from commercial to noncommercial messages, or from one noncommercial message to another, as frequently as desired by the owner of the sign and without the need for City approval unless otherwise required by the Florida Building Code, provided the sign conforms to all regulations herein, including permitted sign type, size, and design criteria.

(Ord. No. 874, § 3(Exh. A), 12-13-05) 
ARTICLE 150. - LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 150-010. - Objective. 
    The purpose of this Article is to provide new regulations for the installation and maintenance of landscaping within the municipal limits of the City of Wilton Manors. It is recognized that landscaping is a necessary ingredient in the urban environment in that trees and shrubs are known producers of oxygen and that trees and shrubs appreciably reduce the carbon dioxide content in the air people breathe and that trees and shrubs are an invaluable physical and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting, making life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land, reducing noise and glare, and breaking the monotony of development on the land. The provisions of this Article are the minimum landscape requirements of the City. Any other regulations relating to removal, replacement, or maintenance of trees which are more restrictive shall supersede these regulations to the extent of any inconsistency. 
Sec. 150-020. - Fractional quantities and measurements. 
    Calculations resulting in a fractional number shall be rounded to the next highest whole number. 
Sec. 150-030. - Perimeter landscape and buffer requirements. 
    Landscape buffer strips shall be required along the perimeter of all property lines, exclusive of single-family and individual duplex development. 
(A)  The minimum width of such buffer strips shall be as follows: 
(1)  Abutting streets and any public right-of-way, excepting alleys and the area abutting any building constructed with zero setback: Ten (10) feet; 
(2)  Abutting rear or side common property lines, except the area abutting any building constructed with zero setback: Five (5) feet. 
(B)  Landscape buffer strips along interior property lines shall contain sod or ground cover and hedge material, unless the perimeter landscaping serves as a required buffer between incompatible uses, in which case it shall also comply with Subsection (D), below. The buffer strip requirement may be waived if the abutting property has a buffer that meets the minimum requirements of this Subsection. 
(C)  Landscape buffer strips along streets and public rights-of-way. The swale area between the property line and the street pavement shall be sodded. One tree shall be planted for every thirty (30) linear feet of property line, excluding driveway openings, within the right-of-way swale, or abutting the right-of-way if there is insufficient swale area as determined by the Director. Trees shall be chosen from the approved planting list in this Article, unless the City requires planting of one or more specific trees from the approved planting list along certain streets, as part of a coordinated street tree landscaping program adopted by the City Commission. Trees shall be placed so that they do not obstruct the visibility of traffic pursuant to Section 155-070, Clear site triangles. 
(D)  All nonresidential uses shall provide the landscaping required in Subsections (B) and (C), above, in addition to a six (6) foot masonry wall, wherever they abut property with residential or mixed commercial/residential zoning. The following uses must contain additional screening as indicated regardless of abutting zoning: 
(1)  Outdoor storage yards shall provide an eight (8) foot masonry wall. 
(E)  Alternate screening may be approved at the time of site plan approval, provided the same level of screening is provided, and provided property owners abutting the proposed alternate screening area are notified and have had opportunity to respond. 
(F)  Where a masonry wall is required along a property line, and an existing wall of the required height already exists on the abutting property along the same property line, the wall requirement shall be waived if the applicant enters into an agreement with the City to erect the required wall should the abutting wall be removed in compliance with these regulations. 
(G)  Masonry walls shall be finished on both sides with cement stucco, and painted two (2) coats of a neutral color which the City may require to match or compliment the color of buildings on the subject property and adjoining properties. 
(H)  Where a fence or wall is to be placed along or near a property line, placement shall be as follows: 
(1)  Along a street line, it must be placed to the rear of a required landscape buffer, with the landscape buffer located on the street side of the wall. 
(2)  Along an interior property line, it must be placed along the property line in between a required landscape buffer and the abutting property, except that an applicant for fence or wall may erect the barrier on the applicant's side of the landscape buffer if the abutting property owner enters into an agreement with the City and the applicant granting a maintenance easement to the applicant, and further agreeing not to erect a fence or wall on near the common property line that would have the effect of closing in the landscape buffer. 
(Ord. No. 848, 10-14-03; Ord. No. 879, § 2, 9-27-05) 
Sec. 150-040. - Vehicular use area (VUA) landscape requirements. 
(A)  All parking areas shall be surrounded by at least a five (5) foot wide planting area unless Section 150-030, Perimeter landscape and buffer requirements, requires a wider planting area. Rows of parking spaces shall be terminated with landscaped islands (a/k/a terminal islands) of not less than ten (10) feet in width and eighteen (18) feet in length. In addition to the above-required terminal islands, one interior island shall be provided for every ten (10) spaces. Each interior island shall also be not less than ten (10) feet in width and eighteen (18) feet in length. The location of interior islands may be staggered in order to avoid regimented appearance or to retain existing trees. Terminal and interior islands shall be completely curbed to protect landscaping from vehicular encroachment. Wheel stops or curbing shall be provided in each parking space. One tree shall be provided for each interior and each terminal island, and shall count towards the overall VUA landscaping requirements. 
(B)  At least twenty (20) per cent of the vehicular use area shall be maintained as landscaped area. For purposes of calculating VUA landscaping, all landscaping within five (5) feet of a VUA shall be counted towards meeting the VUA landscaping requirements, even if such landscaped area is used to meet the perimeter landscaping requirements of Section 150-030. All VUA landscaping shall count towards the total site landscaping requirement. 
(C)  One tree and six (6) shrubs shall be required for every one thousand (1,000) square feet, or fraction thereof, of VUA. 
(1)  The first twenty-five (25) per cent, or fraction thereof, of the required trees shall be shade species with a minimum height of twelve (12) feet and with a three (3) inch minimum trunk diameter at four and one-half (41/2) feet above the ground, and shall be evenly distributed between interior and perimeter VUA landscape areas. 
(2)  Twenty-five (25) per cent of the required trees shall be shade species with a minimum height of eight (8) feet with a two (2) inch minimum trunk diameter at four and one-half (41/2) feet above the ground. 
(3)  Twenty (20) per cent of the required trees shall be conspicuously flowering species with a minimum height of ten (10) feet. 
(4)  Thirty (30) per cent of the required trees may comprise any combination of approved shade, flowering or palm trees. 
(5)  Palm trees may be substituted for shade trees at a ratio of three (3) palm trees to one shade tree, provided no more than fifty (50) per cent of all trees within the VUA may be palms. 
(6)  Native materials shall comprise at least forty (40) per cent of the total provided trees. 
(D)  Failure to install. It shall be unlawful to occupy or use, or cause to be occupied or used, any VUA unless the required landscaping has been installed and approval has been obtained for the use of such VUA, unless the landscaping is substantially complete and the remainder of the materials and installation costs have been bonded. Approval for use of a VUA shall be by certificate of occupancy of the building(s) on the premises or certificate of completion if the VUA is not associated with building construction on the premises. 
    When a VUA is used without first having obtained approval, the Director shall notify the owner or occupier of the land, in writing, to stop the use. If this notice is not complied with by the owner or occupier of the land, the VUA shall be barricaded and remain unoccupied and barricaded until the required landscaping is installed and use approval issued. 
(E)  Existing vehicular use areas. Existing VUA's shall be considered as new and brought into conformity with the minimum requirements of this Section upon the occurrence of any one of the following conditions: 
(1)  When a vehicular use area is expanded, enlarged or restriped; or, 
(2)  Whenever site plan approval is required for additional building area. 
(F)  Retroactive VUA landscaping. 
(1)  Any owner of a parcel of land upon which there is located a vehicular use area which existed prior to April 22, 1997 shall meet at least fifty (50) per cent of the requirements of new vehicular use areas. If a vehicular use area cannot be redesigned and the owner is unable to meet this fifty (50) per cent requirement without reducing the number of required parking spaces, the owner shall comply to the maximum extent possible without reducing the number of required parking spaces. 
(2)  The City Manager shall be authorized to inspect each VUA and provide, as necessary, written notification to the owner, tenant or agent, if any, of the terms and provisions of these regulations. The owner shall submit a landscaping plan to the City within thirty (30) days from the receipt of notification. Installation shall be completed within ninety (90) days from receipt of the initial notification. 
(Ord. No. 879, § 2, 9-27-05) 
Sec. 150-050. - Payment in lieu of landscaping (P.L.L.) 
(A)  It is the intent of this Section that payment in lieu of landscaping be an optional method of providing landscaping for previously developed properties where it is determined by the PZB that a property cannot reasonably conform to the requirements of this Article. The payment or PLL is in the public interest as a means of encouraging the redevelopment of existing private properties and as a means of funding municipal landscaping within developed areas. 
(B)  The owner of existing developed property may make application to the Department for a PLL. 
(C)  Required Planning and Zoning Board findings prior to approval of PLL. 
(1)  That an existing developed property required to achieve or maintain full or partial compliance with any provision of this Article cannot reasonably comply. 
(2)  Any PZB finding that a property cannot reasonably comply with landscaping requirements shall be based upon the conditions listed below. It shall be incumbent upon the applicant to provide evidence establishing that one or more of the following conditions exist: 
a.  Compliance would cause other aspects of the site (example: parking) to become substandard or further substandard relative to Code requirements, or; 
b.  Compliance would compete with other site amenities the DRC deems in the prevailing public interest, or; 
c.  Compliance is not logistically possible; or 
d.  The cost of compliance would exceed the typical cost for identical landscaping by a one hundred (100) per cent margin or greater, as determined by the City. 
(D)  PZB consideration of a PLL is subject to a public hearing conducted and noticed in accordance with the requirements of Article 85 for site plans. No relief from required landscaping on developed properties by any official, board or the City Commission is authorized except pursuant to this Subsection. 
(E)  In authorizing a PLL, the PZB shall determine the degree of nonconformity to be accommodated based upon the percentage of required landscaping that cannot reasonably be provided upon the previously developed property, pursuant to the required findings, above. The PZB shall calculate the cost of providing and installing the required landscaping to be exempted by the PLL. This cost plus an administrative fee for processing shall constitute the payment to be made in lieu of providing the required landscaping. 
(F)  The following additional requirements shall apply to authorization for a PLL: 
(1)  Any onsite landscape arrangement satisfied in this manner shall run with the land, unless the site is redeveloped in a manner that allows for additional potential compliance with the landscaping requirements of this Article, in which case said requirements shall be satisfied on site, or through additional PLL. Any subsequent change of use or alteration which increases the degree of nonconformity to these regulations, if permitted, shall require a recalculation of the PLL and may require payment of additional fees for the cost of landscaping, installation and processing. 
(2)  No refund of PLL shall be made when there is a change of use or alteration which reduces the degree of nonconformity. 
(3)  The PLL shall be made to the City in one lump sum prior to the issuance of any building permit or certificate of occupancy. 
(G)  Funds received from a PLL shall be deposited by the City into a special account, and shall be used and expended only for the purpose of providing municipal landscaping and streetscape improvements within the City.

(2)  Front yard landscaping required for on-street parking. Single-family and duplex lots abutting on-street parking shall provide the landscaping adjacent to a street that is required by subsection 150-030(C). All other uses that are already required to have landscaping pursuant to subsection 150-030(C) shall provide one accent tree for each tree required by 150-030(C), provided the director determines there is sufficient yard area to accommodate the additional trees. 
(C)  Landscaping requirements for residential backout parking. Every residential backout parking facility authorized by subsection 135-020(J), Backout parking, shall provide curbed terminal landscape areas at each end of a row of parking spaces, and shall provide curbed landscape islands such that no more than two (2) parking spaces are contiguous. The landscape areas shall be a minimum of five (5) feet wide and shall extend the length of the adjoining parking spaces to the sidewalk edge. Each terminal landscape area and landscape island shall contain one tree located not more than three (3) feet from an adjacent sidewalk in or abutting the street right-of-way. Terminal landscape areas and landscape islands shall be sodded or planted with approved ground cover, and shall be irrigated.

Where a tract is subdivided into lots substantially larger than the minimum size required in the zoning district in which a subdivision is located, the City Commission may require that streets and lots be laid out so as to permit future resubdivision in accordance with the requirements contained in these regulations. 
(F)  Loop, cul-de-sac and dead-end local residential streets. The creation of cul-de-sac, deadend or loop local residential streets will be permitted wherever the City Commission finds that such type of roadway layout will not interfere with good traffic circulation in the area. Cul-de-sac and dead-end streets must provide a turning area at the closed end. The turning area must conform with recommended practices for local streets as described in A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. In the case of cul-de-sac and dead-end streets, where needed or desirable, the City Commission may require the reservation of a twenty (20) foot wide right-of-way to provide for continuation of pedestrian traffic and utilities to the next street. Subdivisions containing twenty (20) lots or more shall have at least two (2) street connections with existing public streets, or streets on an approved subdivision plat for which a bond has been filed, unless specifically waived by the City Commission. 
(G)  Block size. Blocks generally shall no be less than four hundred (400) feet in depth nor more than thirteen hundred twenty (1,320) feet in length. In general, no block width shall be less than twice the normal lot depth. 
(H)  Intersections with collector or arterial streets. Local street openings into such roads shall, in general, be at least five hundred (500) feet apart. No cross intersections will be permitted except where this restriction would impose undue hardship on the developer. 
(I)  Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be avoided. 
(J)  Angle of intersection. In general, all streets shall join each other so that for a distance of at least one hundred (100) feet the street is approximately at right angles to the street that joins it. 
(K)  Other required streets. Where subdivision borders on or contains a limited access highway or right-of-way, the City may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land (as for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts). Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.

iv.  Sixty-three dollars ($63.00) for any improvement not specified above. 
b.  Inspection fees: This fee shall be based on the hourly rate of the inspector plus a thirty (30) percent employee benefit surcharge to cover fringe benefits. Such charge shall be paid directly to the city as a condition precedent to each inspection. 
c.  The permit fee and inspection fee provided for herein may be amended by Resolution. 
2.  Bond. Whenever an applicant seeks to excavate in the public rights-of-way or on the boundary line of the public rights-of-way, other than for a driveway approach or apron, a cash bond, letter of credit or construction bond, approved by the City Attorney's Office, in the amount of one hundred ten (110) percent of the construction costs as determined by the Utilities Director, shall be deposited with the city prior to the issuance of a permit. The bond shall be held to insure the maintenance of safety devices during construction, completion of the permitted work and any restoration of the area. The city shall retain the bond for a maximum of six (6) months from the date of completion of the work. After all charges and costs, as provided herein, have been paid, the balance shall be returned to the permittee. 
d.  Design specifications: The design of any improvement, including but not limited to any driveway cut, approach or apron, water or sewer installation, paving, drainage related work, or any construction, excavation, or activity related thereto, shall conform to standards established or approved by the city engineer. 
e.  Requirements to protect the public during construction: As the city cannot inspect each permitted site daily, it shall be the duty of each permittee to protect his construction site or excavation by means of barricades, lights, steel plating or other appropriate materials all to ensure the safety of the public during construction. All such notice provisions or signage shall be installed pursuant to the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, as well as all relevant state statutes, county and municipal ordinances. 
Pedestrian walkways shall remain clear at all times. If a pedestrian walkway is to be obstructed, a temporary uncovered walkway shall be constructed in the right-of-way, the walkway must be not less than four (4) feet wide in the clear, built in a safe, substantial and workmanlike manner and maintained in that condition at all times. Where it is not possible or feasible to provide an alternate route of uncovered walkway, the applicant may propose a covering over and across the existing walkways, to be certified by a Florida Structural Engineer as a temporary safe means of cover for pedestrians. A barrier must be provided on the traffic side, and as deemed necessary is to be required on the inside. As determined by the Director of Community Development Services, a walkway of greater width may be required if the anticipated volume of pedestrian traffic warrants. 
Any excavation found not to be properly barricaded, lighted, steel plated or otherwise protected as to insure safe travel, as prescribed, shall be in violation of this section and shall immediately be closed by the city with the cost thereof charged against the required bond (or other security) or against the applicant if no bond was required. 
f.  Restoration of construction area: Upon completion of each and every excavation, the person or corporation responsible shall refill the excavation and shall repave or otherwise restore the area. All such restoration work shall be done in accordance with standards established or approved by the city engineer. 
g.  Exception to permitting procedure: A permit shall not be required for the following specific improvements. However, said improvements must be constructed or installed pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the city engineer. 
1.  Mailbox. 
2.  Sod. 
3.  Sprinkler system. 
h.  Maintenance of all improvements: All improvements in the public rights-of-way must be periodically inspected and maintained in a state of good repair by the abutting property owner (or the party who generated the improvement) to insure safe travel as well as to maintain aesthetics. 
All such improvements placed or maintained in the rights-of-way upon either actual or constructive knowledge that repairs to the rights-of-way or to utility lines which lie underneath the rights-of-way may require destruction of such improvements. 
In such event, neither the city nor any contractor operating under a permit authorized by this section, shall incur any liability for replacement or repair of such improvements, other than for sod, sprinklers, normal driveway approached and/or anything required or permitted under the land development regulations to the city standard provided further that such items were permitted under this chapter.

Sec. 165-020. - Enforcement and penalty. 
(a)  Enforcement. It shall be a violation of the land development regulations for any person to fail to comply with the terms or conditions of any permit or authority required or granted pursuant to this chapter. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate and individual offense. The city manager or his designee shall assign the enforcement of the provisions of this section as provided by law or by other sections of the land development regulations. 
(b)  Emergency. Situations where the public safety is affected are hereby defined as emergency in nature and authority is given to the city manager to take appropriate actions. At the discretion of the city manager, the city may remove or repair the construction site or improvement thereon and bill the abutting property owner, franchisee or other appropriate party for all reasonable costs associated with such emergency action. A diligent effort shall be made to contact the party in interest prior to such actions, however, if that person cannot be contacted or if the peril is imminent, actions reasonably necessary to protect the public shall be taken without delay. 
(c)  Municipal lien. In the event that the city expends public funds as provided by paragraph (b) of this section as a result of the responsible parties' failure to maintain the construction site or improvement in a safe manner, the city shall notify the party in interest by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the last known address of the party. This notice shall include information sufficient to identify the problem, the total costs due the city, and the time period in which that amount must be paid before the city will take further action. If after a period of thirty (30) days from the mailing of said notice, payment has not been made, the same shall be and constitute a lien upon the property in question, and the city attorney is hereby authorized to take necessary and appropriate legal action to recover the amount then due (including costs and a reasonable attorney's fee) and owing to the city.
