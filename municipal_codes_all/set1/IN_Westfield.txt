PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Westfield, Indiana. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1990 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1990 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and Laura L. Johnson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Jerry L. Rosenberger, Town Manager, and Mr. Brian Zaiger, Town Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

Sec. 2-501. - Establishing a fixed asset capitalization policy. 
    The fixed asset capitalization policy is hereby established. 
(Ord. No. 99-03, 6-14-99) 
Sec. 2-502. - Definitions and provisions. 
    For the purposes of this division, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning: 
    Tangible assets: Assets that can be observed by one or more of the physical senses. They may be seen and touched and, in some environments heard and smelled. 
    Fixed assets: Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the operating activities of the departments and utilities and that are relatively permanent and are needed for the delivery of city and utility services. These fixed assets will be defined into classes as follows: land, buildings, machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, improvements other than buildings. 
    Capital outlays: Expenditures which benefit both the current and future fiscal periods. This includes costs of acquiring land or structures, construction or improvement of buildings, structures or other fixed assets, and equipment purchases having an appreciable and calculable period of usefulness. These are expenditures that result in the acquisition of or addition to the government's general fixed assets. 
    Land: The city will capitalize all land purchases regardless of cost. 
    Exceptions to land capitalization are land purchased outright as easements or rights of way for infrastructure needs (i.e., roads and streets, street lighting, bridges sidewalks, trails, curbs, street signs and stormwater collection). Easements required for water or sewer infrastructure may be capitalized. 
    Original cost of land will include the full value given to the seller, in addition to those costs associated with securing and preparing the land for final use. These fees may include legal, appraisal, negotiation, title work and opinion, surveying, and costs required to prepare the land for its intended use. 
    A department will record donated land at fair market value on the date of transfer plus any associated costs. 
    Purchases made using federal or state funding will follow the source funding policies in addition to the above procedures. 
    Machinery and equipment: 
    The definition of machinery and equipment is an apparatus, tool, conglomeration of pieces to form a tool or purchased equipment. These items will stand alone and not become a part of a basic structure or building. 
    The city will capitalize items with an individual value equal to or greater than $1,000.00. Machinery combined with other machinery to form one unit with a total value greater than the above-mentioned limit will be one unit. 
    Shipping charges, consultant fees, and any other cost directly associated with the purchase, delivery, or set up, will be capitalized. 
    Improvements or renovations to existing machinery and equipment will be capitalized only if the result of the change meets all of the following conditions: 
(1)  Total costs exceed $1,000.00; 
(2)  The useful life is extended two or more years; and 
    A department will record donated machinery and equipment at fair market value on the date of transfer with any associated costs included. 
    Purchases made using federal or state funding will follow the source funding policies in addition to the above procedures. 
    Buildings: 
    A department will capitalize buildings at full cost with no requirement for subcategories for tracking the cost of separate building systems like HVAC, sprinklers, plumbing, lighting, etc. If subcategories are beneficial for enterprise accounting this may be done. The department will include the cost of items designed or purchased exclusively for the building. 
    A department's new building will be capitalized only if it meets the following two conditions: 
(1)  The total cost exceeds $5,000.00. 
(2)  The useful life is greater than five years. 
    A department improving or renovating an existing building will capitalize the cost only if the result meets all of the following conditions: 
(1)  The total cost exceeds $2,500.00; 
(2)  The useful life is extended two or more years; and 
    Capital building costs will include preparation of land for the building, architectural and engineering fees, bond issuance fees, interest cost (while under construction), accounting costs if material, and any other costs directly attributable to the construction of a building. 
    A department will record donated buildings at fair market value on the date of transfer with any associated costs. 
    Purchases made using federal or state funding will follow the source funding policies in addition to the above procedures. 
    Improvements other than buildings: 
    The definition of this category of fixed assets is improvements to land that results in better enjoyment of that land and also has a life expectancy greater than two years. The fixed asset in this class is also attached or not easily removed from the existing land. Examples are walks, parking areas and drives, golf cart paths, fencing, retaining walls, pools, outside fountains, planters, underground sprinkler systems, and other similar items. 
    The city will capitalize new improvements other than buildings only if it meets the following two conditions: 
(1)  The total cost exceeds $5,000.00; 
(2)  The useful life is greater than two years. 
    A department will capitalize improvements or renovations to existing improvements other than buildings only if the result meets all of the following conditions: 
(1)  The total cost exceeds $2,500.00; 
(2)  The asset's useful life is extended two or more years; and 
    A department's donated improvements other than buildings will be recorded at fair market value on the date of the transfer with any associated costs. 
    Purchases made using federal or state funding will follow the source funding policies and above procedures. 
    Historical costs: The cash equivalent price exchanged for goods or services at the date of acquisition. Land, buildings, equipment, and most inventories are common examples of items recognized under the historical cost attribute. 
    Enterprise funds: 
    Enterprise funds are those used to account for operations (a) that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business enterprise, where the intent of the governing body is that the costs (expenses, including depreciation) of providing goods or services to the general public on a continuing basis be financed or recovered primarily through user charges; or (b) where the governing body has decided that periodic determination of revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for capital maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability and other purposes. 
    The enterprise funds of the City of Westfield, Indiana, shall include the municipally owned water and wastewater utilities. Operation of these utilities shall require enterprise fund accounting and reporting. 
(Ord. No. 99-03, 6-14-99) 
Sec. 2-503. - Recording and accounting. 
    The city and its various departments shall classify capital expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the expenditure was made in accordance with the Chart of Accounts of the Cities and Towns Accounting Manual. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes all expenditures necessary to put the asset into position and ready for use. For purposes of recording fixed assets of the city and its departments, the valuation of assets shall be based on historical cost or where the historical cost is indeterminable, by estimation for those assets in existence 
    The city's municipally owned utilities shall record acquisition of fixed assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. When an asset is purchased for cash, the acquisition is simply recorded at the amount of cash paid, including all outlays relating to its purchase and preparation for intended use. Assets may be acquired under a number of other arrangements including: 
(1)  Assets acquired for a lump-sum purchase price. 
(2)  Purchase on deferred payment contract. 
(3)  Acquisition under capital lease. 
(4)  Acquisition by exchange of nonmonetary assets. 
(5)  Acquisition by issuance of securities. 
(6)  Acquisition by self-construction. 
(7)  Acquisition by donation or discovery. 
(8)  Acquisition by grant funds. 
(9)  Acquisition by contribution. 
    Some of these arrangements present special problems relating to the cost to be recorded, for example, in utility accounting, interest during a period of construction has long been recognized as a part of the asset cost. For purposes of recording fixed assets of the utilities, the valuation of assets shall be based on historical costs. 
    In addition, an asset register (prescribed form 211) shall be maintained to provide a detail record of the capital assets of the governmental unit. 
(Ord. No. 99-03, 6-14-99)

DIVISION 15. - INVESTMENT POLICY FOR CITY FUNDS RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF WATER AND WASTEWATER ASSETS 

Sec. 2-531. - Scope and intent. 
    This division sets forth the investment policy of the City of Westfield, Indiana ("city"). This statement of investment policy, objectives and guidelines (the "investment policy") applies to the investment of funds received from the sale of the water and wastewater assets to Citizen's Energy Group. The common council of the city (the "council") is responsible for fiduciary oversight of these invested funds. The council has approved this investment policy in furtherance of its goal to meet the investment objectives listed in section 2-533. 
(Ord. No. 13-33, § 1(Exh. A), 12-9-13) 
Sec. 2-532. - Purpose of this investment policy. 
    This investment policy has been adopted by the council in order to: 
(1)  Define and assign the responsibilities of all involved parties. 
(2)  Establish a clear understanding for all involved parties of the investment goals and objectives of city assets. 
(3)  Establish the relevant investment time horizon(s) for which the assets will be managed. 
(4)  Manage assets according to prudent standards. 
(5)  Establish a basis for evaluating investment results. 
(6)  Adopt and implement the provisions of Indiana Code 5-13-9-1 et seq. (the "Municipal Investment Act") including, in particular, Section 5.7 of the Municipal Investment Act. 
(b)  In general, the purpose of this statement is to outline a philosophy and attitude which will guide the investment of the assets toward the desired results while complying with Indiana Code. It is intended to be sufficiently specific to be meaningful, yet flexible enough to be practical. 
(Ord. No. 13-33, § 1(Exh. A), 12-9-13) 
Sec. 2-533. - Objectives of the investment policy. 
    The primary objectives, in priority order, of the city's investment program shall be: 
(1)  Safety. Safety of principal shall be the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments shall be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. Credit risk will be minimized both by diversification (limiting the potential for loss from any one issuer or any one type of security) and by limiting investments to the types of securities described in section 2-535 hereof. Market risk will be minimized both by structuring the portfolio so that investments generally mature in time to meet anticipated cash requirements (limiting the need to sell securities prior to maturity) and by investing primarily in shorter-term securities. 
(2)  Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall be structured so that investments generally mature in time to meet anticipated cash requirements. Further, since all cash requirements cannot be anticipated, the portfolio shall consist primarily of cash equivalents and securities with active secondary or resale markets. 
(3)  Yield. The investment portfolio shall be structured with the objective of attaining a market rate of return, taking into account the constraints of safety and liquidity described above. Return on investment is less important than safety and liquidity. 
(4)  Full investment. To the extent practicable, all funds shall be fully deployed as earning assets. 
(5)  Minimal turnover. Securities shall typically not be sold prior to maturity, with the following exceptions: 
a.  A declining-credit security can be sold early to minimize the potential loss of principal; 
b.  A security can be sold and replaced with another if such action improves the quality or yield of the portfolio; 
c.  A security can be sold early to meet liquidity needs. 
(Ord. No. 13-33, § 1(Exh. A), 12-9-13) 
Sec. 2-534. - Delegation of authority. 
(a)  The authority to operate and manage the investment program is granted to the council which may delegate such authority, together with any investment officer(s) that the council designates as such (together, the "investment officers"). the clerk-treasurer, the council and any additional investment officers, which may include third party investment advisors, shall establish controls and procedures to implement this program which shall include regular quarterly reporting to the council. 
(b)  The standard of care shall be as follows: 
(1)  Prudence. Investments shall be made in accordance with the prudent person standard. This standard provides that an investor shall act with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing, that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with like aims. 
Investment officers acting in accordance with this investment policy statement and any written procedures and exercising due diligence, shall be relieved of personal liability for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided that deviations from expected results are reported in a timely fashion and that appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments. 
(2)  Ethics and conflicts of interest. Investment officers shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution and management of the city's investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions. Investment officers should also maintain knowledge of all applicable laws, rules and regulations; and not knowingly violate, or participate or assist in the violation of, such laws, rules and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 13-33, § 1(Exh. A), 12-9-13; Ord. No. 14-31, § 1(Exh. A), 7-14-14) 
Sec. 2-535. - Investment instruments. 
(a)  The city is only permitted to invest funds in those investments authorized by Indiana law, including but not limited to the Municipal Investment Act, which authorizations are hereby made a part of this policy. It is the policy of the city and this council to limit allowable investments to the following types of securities: 
(1)  U.S. Treasury securities (e.g. bills, notes, bonds, SLGS, STRIPS, and TIPS), which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. 
(2)  Federal agency obligations (including both federally related institution securities and federally sponsored agency securities), including, but not limited to, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Farmer Mac, and Federal Home Loan Bank debt: Any full-faith-and-credit securities are permitted. 
(3)  Mortgage pass-through securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac: Any full-faith-and-credit securities are permitted. 
(4)  Municipal securities issued by an Indiana local government entity, a quasi-governmental entity related to the state, or a unit of government, municipal corporation or special taxing district in Indiana, so long as the issuer has not defaulted on any of its obligations within the past 20 years and the security is rated in one of the three highest rating categories by any one of Standard & Poor's, Moody's, or Fitch or, if the security is not rated by any one of Standard & Poor's, Moody's, or Fitch, securities of such issuer having the same or materially similar pledged revenue source of re-payment have within the past two years been rated in one of the three highest categories by any one of Standard & Poor's, Moody's, or Fitch. For avoidance of doubt, the three highest categories would include ratings in the AAA, AA and A categories, including any modifiers of + or - in the case of Standard & Poor's or Fitch and 1, 2 or 3 in the case of Moody's. 
(5)  Repurchase agreements, if at least 105 percent collateralized by any of the above. 
(6)  Money market mutual funds regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission: 
a.  Only open-end no-load funds are permitted (i.e. no commission or fee shall be charged on purchases or sales of shares) 
b.  Permitted funds will be those that limit assets of the fund to U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency securities, and repurchase agreements collateralized by the same; or that are rated in the highest rating category by one of the rating agencies. 
c.  These funds seek to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per share. 
d.  By definition these funds will meet the requirements for portfolio maturity, portfolio quality, and portfolio diversification in Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 
(7)  Time deposits in state or nationally chartered banks (who are designated as a depository under Section 5 of the Municipal Investment Act) whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, with balances not to exceed $250,000.00 per institution. 
(b)  Additional securities may be added to the above approved list with the approval of the council. 
(c)  Investments are not permitted in certain derivatives, nor in certain mutual funds which invest primarily in such securities. Investments specifically prohibited are those characterized as being illiquid, highly volatile and difficult to value. Prohibited securities include, but are not limited to, mortgage derivatives such as Z-bonds, PAC-2s and Re-REMICS. 
(Ord. No. 13-33, § 1(Exh. A), 12-9-13; Ord. No. 14-31, § 1, Exh. A), 7-14-14) 
Sec. 2-536. - Investment parameters. 
(a)  Maximum maturity. To the extent possible, investments will be matched with anticipated cash flow requirements. Subject to the limitations of Section 5.7 of the Municipal Investment Act, the city shall not invest in securities maturing on a date which is more than two years from the date of purchase, provided, however, (i) not more than 25 percent of the city's investment of its total portfolio of public funds may be invested for more than two years but not more than five years from the date of purchase; and (ii) that funds which are not public funds such as, but not limited to, indentured reserve funds are not subject to the foregoing maturity limitations and may exceed five years if the maturities of such investments precede the expected use of such funds. 
(b)  Average maturity. The average weighted maturity of the portfolio should not typically exceed three years. 
(c)  Diversification. Investments shall be diversified by type of security and issuer. Except for cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury securities, the total portfolio shall consist of no more than 40 percent of any single type of security or single name (e.g., City of Indianapolis). 
(Ord. No. 13-33, § 1(Exh. A), 12-9-13) 
Sec. 2-537. - Safekeeping and custody. 
(a)  All investment transactions, including, but not limited to, those completed by telephone, shall be supported in writing and approved by an investment officer. Written communication may be made by facsimile on city letterhead. 
(b)  Book entry. The city shall strive to invest in book-entry securities, thus avoiding physical delivery of securities. No securities shall be physically stored or kept in the offices of the city. 
(c)  Custodial safekeeping. Securities purchased from any bank or dealer, including collateral when appropriate, shall generally be placed with the appropriate trustee or with an independent third party for safekeeping. 
Any security that is able to be wired over the FedWire will be kept safe in a customer or trust account in a Federal Reserve Bank through the appropriate custodial bank. 
Any security not able to be wired over the FedWire, that is held by the Depository Trust Corporation (DTC), shall be held in the name of the city or trustee, if applicable, through the appropriate custodial bank. 
Securities may be held by a broker/dealer to the extent the broker/dealer serves as an agent for the city or the appropriate trustee. No securities will be held by a broker/dealer without evidence of adequate Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) insurance (or protection judged to be equivalent by the city or the appropriate trustee). 
(d)  Delivery vs. payment. All securities will be held in accounts in the name of the city or the appropriate trustee. Securities will be deposited prior to the release of funds. Securities held by a third party custodian will be evidenced by safekeeping receipts. 
(Ord. No. 13-33, § 1(Exh. A), 12-9-13) 
Sec. 2-538. - Performance and reporting. 
(a)  Annual report. The investment officers shall prepare an investment report at least annually which shall provide a clear picture of the status of the portfolio and transactions made over the preceding year. Such report shall be designed to allow the council to ascertain whether the investment activities during the reporting period have conformed to this investment policy. 
(b)  Performance. The portfolio should achieve a market rate of return during a market environment of stable interest rates. Portfolio performance shall be compared at least annually to the yield on three-month, six-month and one-year U.S. Treasury obligations. Such performance comparison may be included in the quarterly report of the city. 
(Ord. No. 13-33, § 1(Exh. A), 12-9-13) 
Sec. 2-539. - Investment policy duration and review. 
(a)  Expiration. - This investment policy expires on December 9, 2017. 
(b)  Periodic review. To assure continued relevance of the policies, objectives, guidelines, as established in this investment policy, the council plans to review this investment statement at least every year.

(15)  Whenever a building or structure, used or intended to be used for dwelling purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay, damage, faulty construction or arrangement, inadequate light, air or sanitation facilities, or otherwise, is determined by any governmental official to be unsanitary, unfit for human habitation, or in such a condition that is likely to cause sickness or disease.

ARTICLE V. - EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 06-52, §§ 1-8, adopted Nov. 13, 2006, amended Art. V in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. V, §§ 34-111-34-118, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 06-16, §§ 1-8, adopted April 10, 2006. 

Sec. 34-111. - Purpose and intent. 
    The primary purpose of this article is to ensure perimeter sediment and erosion control, with best management practices (BMP's) being utilized to prevent and minimize sediment and erosion discharge from leaving the construction site. The intent of this article is to prevent non-storm water discharges, erosion and minimize sediment from leaving the site. Failure to do so can result in damage to adjacent property, damage to the MS4's storm sewer system, and contribute to the polluting of streams, lakes and rivers. 
    The City of Westfield Improvement Location Permit Application ("ILP"), generally known as a building permit, permittee (the "permittee") is responsible for ensuring that adequate BMP's are in place and functioning until the construction project obtains a certificate of occupancy ("C of O") from the city building department. The property owner, after the C of O is issued, is responsible to maintain the erosion control measures until adequate ground cover (70% mature growth) is established and the property is required to have established adequate ground cover within two years from the issuance of the C of O. 
    Compliance with this article shall be the responsibility of the party listed on the ILP filed with the city. 
(Ord. No. 06-52, § 1, 11-13-06) 
Sec. 34-112. - Best Management Practices (BMP's) for construction lots. 
    Examples of BMP's include but are not limited to: Sediment fence, straw mat, seed, mulch, coconut and fiber rolls, or other types approved by the Westfield Public Works Department ("WPWD"). The sequence of installation shall be: 
(1)  Grading/excavating. Install all BMP's prior to any grading or excavating activities, where practical. 
(2)  Inlet protection. Ensure that the BMP's are in place and functioning for both yard inlets and curb inlets around the perimeter of the lot. 
(3)  Protection of adjacent lots. Install BMP's along the common lot line of adjacent lots. 
(4)  Stabilize stockpiles. Install BMP's to stabilize stockpiles to prevent erosion and sediment from entering the street. 
(5)  Installation of BMP's. Follow manufacturer's recommendations and requirements for the installation of all BMP's. 
(6)  Temporary construction entrance. A temporary stone access drive is required for all lots and shall be utilized for access onto the lot. 
(7)  Maintenance. The builder is responsible for maintaining and repairing all BMP's as needed throughout construction. 
(8)  Final grading. BMP's may be removed in order to complete final grading on the lot. However, BMP's will be required to be reinstalled until seed germination establishes 70 percent mature growth. On lots where sod is installed erosion control measures are not required to be installed, unless requested by the WPWD. For lots where sod installation is delayed, the contractor will be required to maintain BMP's until the sod can be installed effectively. 
(9)  Concrete wash out. Required onsite or within development. 
(Ord. No. 06-52, § 2, 11-13-06) 
Sec. 34-113. - Responsibilities of permittee. 
(a)  The permittee is responsible for ensuring that a BMP's measures remain in place during the construction process and that the installation and continuous maintenance of all lot erosion and sediment control devices are monitored. 
(b)  Periodic inspection will be necessary to ensure that erosion and sediment control measures are functioning as designed and installed per the manufacturer's specifications. In addition, to standard periodic inspections, this article requires that the permittee conduct inspections after each rain event of one-half-inch or more in a 24-hour period. Any problems noted during these inspections shall be corrected immediately. 
(c)  Once the permittee has started construction, the permittee is responsible for the maintenance of erosion and sediment control measures protecting yard inlets on and/or adjacent to their lots, as well as curb inlets along the street frontage. Sediment must not be allowed to enter the storm sewer system and allowing such is a violation of this article. 
(d)  A temporary construction entrance provides a place for parking vehicles off of the street and a spot where material can be off loaded. This requirement is to provide a stable surface for parking vehicles where mud and other debris will not to be tracked onto the street. Proper maintenance of the area is required until such time as a permanent driveway is installed. 
(e)  During the entire construction process the permittee is responsible to ensure that mud, dirt, rocks, and other debris are not allowed to erode onto streets and sidewalks, nor tracked onto the streets by construction vehicles. At no time shall any mud or other debris be deposited onto the street. 
(f)  Failure to keep streets clear of mud sediment, and debris will result in an enforcement action by the WPWD under the authority of the City of Westfield's Stormwater Management Ordinance (05-30). The permittee will be responsible for incurring all costs associated with cleaning the streets. 
(Ord. No. 06-52, § 3, 11-13-06) 
Sec. 34-114. - Administration and application. 
(a)  The WPWD will administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article. 
(b)  This article shall apply to all construction activity, (direct or indirect stormwater discharges, and illicit discharges) entering within the storm drainage system, MS4, or receiving waters under the jurisdiction of the city. 
(c)  Any permittee subject to an NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. If provisions of this ordinance are more restrictive than the NPDES stormwater discharge permit, proof of compliance with said permit and this article may be required in a form acceptable to the WPWD prior to allowing discharges to the MS4. 
(d)  The provisions of this article shall be deemed as additional requirements to minimum standards required by other provisions of the City of Westfield Code, and as supplemental requirements to Indiana's Rule 5 regarding stormwater discharge associated with construction activity and Indiana's Rule 13 regarding stormwater runoff associated with MS4 conveyances.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 12-13, §§ 1-13, adopted July 9, 2012, has been treated by the editor as supserseding former Art. II, §§ 40-31-40-44, which pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 07-28, §§ 1-14, adopted Dec. 10, 2007. 
Cross reference- Partial waiving of road impact fees for public schools and churches, § 2-438; streets, sidewalks and other public places, ch. 54. 

Sec. 40-31. - Conditional repeal and limitation on imposition of impact fee. 
    This article shall expire and become void five years after its effective date, as required by IC 36-7-4-1340, unless action is undertaken to replace it consistent with the provisions of Indiana law which contemplates a replacement impact fee ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 12-13, § 1, 7-9-12) 
Sec. 40-32. - Establishment of impact zone. 
(a)  There is hereby established for the city a road and street infrastructure impact zone (as defined in Ind. Code § 36-7-4-1307), the borders of which are co-terminus with the existing corporate boundary of the City of Westfield, Hamilton County, Indiana, as they may be extended from time to time through annexation, over all of which the city exercises planning and zoning jurisdiction. The council specifically finds that there is a functional relationship between the components of the road and street thoroughfare element of the Zone Improvement Plan and that such road and street improvement recommendations provide a reasonably uniform benefit to all of the citizens of the city throughout the impact zone as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives. The city further finds that all areas within the impact zone are contiguous, as required by IC 36-7-4-1316. 
(b)  Except as provided below, this article shall apply uniformly to all developments within the impact zone hereby established for which the city may require a structural building permit and which create a need for new or additional road and street infrastructure. This article shall not apply to: 
(1)  Developments meeting the requirements set forth in IC 36-7-4-1322; 
(2)  Improvements which do not require a structural building permit; 
(3)  Improvements which do not create a need for new or additional road and street infrastructure, including the erection of a sign, structures or fences, or the alteration, renovation or expansion of an improvement where the use, or intensity thereof, has not changed; and 
(4)  The replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed improvement; provided, however, that the replacement improvement does not create a need for new and additional road and street infrastructure over and above the infrastructure needed for the original improvement prior to the destruction or partial destruction thereof. 
(Ord. No. 12-13, § 2, 7-9-12) 
Sec. 40-33. - Establishment of impact fee. 
(a)  Based upon the analyses contained in the zone improvement plan, the city finds, determines, establishes and adopts that the cost per twenty-four-hour trip within the impact zone is in the amount of (See Exhibit A). This equates to (See exhibit A) per single family detached residence, and this amount is hereby adopted as the impact fee for the city. Otherwise, the numbers of twenty-four-hour trips are to be based upon calculations taken from the latest version of the ITE Trip Generation Manual, a study published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers ("ITE"). 
(b)  The city hereby makes as a part of the record of these proceedings all of the data collected, calculations made, and conclusions reached by HNTB in the process of developing the zone improvement plan, and specifically instructs the employees of the city to make such data and all other information gathered and used in preparing the zone improvement plan publicly available as a public record of the city for review during the city's regular business hours. The city further authorizes HNTB to sell or otherwise distribute copies of the zone improvement plan and any of the other data collected upon which it relied, at a cost reasonably intended to compensate them for the cost of reproduction only. The city makes the specific finding that this Ordinance is the result of the advice it received from HNTB. 
(c)  In the event that any parcel of real estate considered in the creation of the zone improvement plan undergoes a change in use, redevelopment, or modification which requires an improvement location permit, and creates a need for new infrastructure, an Impact Fee will only be assessed for the increase in the burden on infrastructure. 
(Ord. No. 12-13, § 3, 7-9-12) 
Sec. 40-34. - Credit in lieu of payment; exemptions. 
(a)  Any person or entity obligated to pay a fee pursuant to the terms of this article shall have the option of financing, constructing and dedicating actual road and street thoroughfare infrastructure instead of paying all or part of the impact fee which may be due, so long as such financing, construction and dedication are accomplished pursuant to the thoroughfare plan of the city and in accordance with the road and street specifications for such road or street to be improved in force within the city at that time. Such fee payer, or other person or entity providing the infrastructure or improvement, shall be given credit upon a verified certification from a registered engineer, architect or contractor of the actual costs of planning, financing, constructing and dedicating such road and street thoroughfare improvements or infrastructure to the city. Such certification shall be presented prior to the issuance of any structural building or improvement location permit. In the event the actual cost of such planning, financing, construction and dedication do not equal the amount of the impact fee due pursuant to the calculation provided for in the schedule set forth in section 30-43, the remaining balance shall be due by such fee payer to the city in accordance with the provisions this article. 
(b)  Credits against impact fees otherwise due shall be allowed pursuant to this section 30-44 for all infrastructure and improvements constructed or furnished in accordance with IC 36-7-4-1313 and 1335. A fee payer or other person or entity responsible for installing infrastructure or improvements may designate in writing a method of allocating its credits to future fee payers who may be successors in interest to the credits earned by the fee payer or others, as part of the certification provided above. 
(c)  Any person or entity otherwise obligated to pay the fee established by this article whose property was totally or partially destroyed by fire, storm or other casualty beyond their control, shall be exempt from paying the impact fee if they repair or replace the destroyed structure without creating a burden on infrastructure greater than the burden imposed by the destroyed structure. In the event it creates any additional burden, the impact fee shall be calculated based only on the increased burden created by the structure. 
(Ord. No. 12-13, § 4, 7-9-12) 
Sec. 40-35. - Impact fee due upon issuance of structural building permit. 
    The impact fee imposed pursuant to the terms of this article shall be due and payable upon the issuance of a structural building permit by the city. It is understood that a structural building permit is synonymous with the term "structural building permit" as used in IC 36-7-4-1323, in that the issuance of a structural building permit authorizes the applicant to commence construction activities, structural and otherwise. The entire impact fee which is calculated pursuant to the terms of this article shall be due at the time of permit issuance unless the amount of the fee upon calculation is greater than $5,000.00, in which case an installment plan may be requested by the applicant in accordance with the terms of IC 36-7-4-1324. 
    The Westfield Impact Fee Review Board (the "review board"), as identified in section 40-41 herein, shall establish specific rules for installment payments consistent with Indiana law. The interest rate on any installment plan or deferred payment shall be the pre-judgment rate of interest set forth in the Indiana Code. 
    If a fee payer so requests, the amount of the impact fee shall be assessed upon the voluntary submission of a development plan or upon the issuance of the structural building permit, whichever is earlier. For purposes of this section 40-35, "assessment" means the act of calculating the amount of the impact fee which shall be due. The city shall make such assessment within thirty (30) days of the date of such voluntary request or at the issuance of the structural building permit with or without a request. 
(Ord. No. 12-13, § 5, 7-9-12) 
Sec. 40-36. - Lien rights established. 
    Pursuant to IC 36-7-4-1325, the city acquires a lien against the real estate which is the subject of the impact fee on the date the structural building permit is issued. Upon final adoption of the ordinance from which this article derives, the ordinance shall be recorded and, thereafter, it shall constitute constructive notice of the lien rights of the city. The city may, in its discretion, file a specific instrument setting forth its statutory lien rights with respect to a parcel of real estate which is the subject of an installment payment of an impact fee, and such instrument shall constitute actual notice in addition to the constructive notice provided for by the recording of the ordinance from which this article derives. 
Sec. 40-37. - Form of receipt. 
    The clerk-treasurer of the city shall issue a receipt for any and all impact fees collected, and the form of such receipt shall be as follows:

At such hearing, the fee payer shall bear the burden of presenting either of the following propositions: 
(1)  A fact assumption used in determining the amount of the impact fee is incorrect; or; 
(2)  The amount of the impact fee is greater than the amount allowed under IC 36-7-4-1320, 1321, and 1322. 
Upon conclusion of the presentation of evidence, the review board shall make a determination within not more than 30 days, upon the facts presented and may make such adjustments in the impact fee as they believe are appropriate under the circumstances, if any. 
(b)  An appeal under this Section 8 must be filed not later than 30 days after the issuance of the structural building permit. The appeal shall be initiated with the filing of a petition for review with the clerk-treasurer's office, together with a filing fee in the amount of $100.00. The filing fee shall be refunded in full (1) if the petition for review is granted and the impact fee is eliminated, reduced or adjusted by the review board, by independent action of the city, or by a court having jurisdiction, and (2) if the reviewing body determines that the amount of the fee, reductions, or credits was arbitrary or capricious. The petition for review shall be in a form calculated to inform the review board of the nature of the complaint, the parties to the action, and the relief requested. In addition, the petition shall describe the new development on which the impact fee has been assessed, all facts relating to the assessment of the impact fee, and the reasons petitioner believes that the amount of the impact fee assessed is erroneous or is greater than the amount allowed by the fee limitations set forth in the enabling statute. 
(c)  The city shall not deny the issuance of a structural building permit on the basis that the impact fee has not been paid or condition issuance of the permit on the payment of the impact fee. If the impact fee totals $1,000.00 or less, the city may require the fee payer to pay the impact fee or initiate an appeal under this section 40-38 before the structural building permit is issued.

Sec. 40-39. - Road and street thoroughfare fund. 
(a)  The city has established a road and street thoroughfare fund (the "fund") in compliance with IC 36-7-4-1329. 
(b)  Pursuant to IC 36-7-4-1332(e), the clerk-treasurer is designated as the city official responsible for acting upon refund requests. In order to facilitate refunds when they may be due, the clerk-treasurer is directed to identify the purpose of any impact fee paid in order that a refund, if any, may be paid from the fund or account into which the fee was originally deposited. 
(Ord. No. 12-13, § 9, 7-9-12) 
Sec. 40-40. - Use of impact fees collected pursuant to this article. 
    Any and all fees collected pursuant to the provisions of this article may be utilized for the purposes identified in IC 36-7-4-1330, only by the city, which, for purpose of this article, is identified as the "infrastructure agency" contemplated by IC 36-7-4-1317. 
(Ord. No. 12-13, § 10, 7-9-12) 
Sec. 40-41. - Westfield impact fee review board. 
    The city has established an impact fee review board, the Westfield Impact Fee Review Board (the "Review Board"), in accordance with the IC 36-7-4-1338.

Note- Formerly numbered as § 44-8. 
Sec. 44-10. - Tree inspection. 
(a)  Purpose. Trees are a major asset as they add beauty to the City of Westfield properties. Trees also save the community money by shading buildings, filtering air, slowing down water run-off and adding to the property values of individual homes. The City of Westfield also recognizes that if trees are not maintained, they can become a major detriment. It is for this reason that the city realizes a need for a tree inspection policy. The parks and recreation department will implement and manage this policy for the city. 
(b)  Tree inspection policy. 
(1)  The policy. 
a.  The city recognizes a need to inspect trees within its managed grounds. The parks and recreation department (hereafter called department) intends to inspect trees within the city's managed grounds pursuant to the policy. 
b.  To perform this function, the department has developed an active policy to maintain the safety of city-managed grounds, keeping them free from potentially hazardous trees, by timely removal of any tree or tree part deemed hazardous. To assist in assessing the condition of its trees, the department proposes to train maintenance and other pertinent staff members on the principles of visual tree assessment (VTA). 
c.  Since the city has limited fiscal and human resources, the removal of high risk trees shall be done on a risk priority basis. The parks director will administer this policy and have the final determination in all matters concerning the mitigation measures to be taken for any tree deemed potentially hazardous. 
(2)  The parks director further determines the following as a standard of care related to this policy: 
a.  Oversight of policy: The parks director in overseeing this policy directs the department to have the day-to-day (or general) oversight of this policy. A report should be prepared for the board of public works and safety/tree board at their spring board meeting. 
b.  Objectives of policy: The goal of this policy is to protect the residents, city employees, visitors and general public from harm that might be caused by trees on the city's properties, rights-of-way, common areas, grounds and/or other managed properties. To protect the woodland feel of the city's grounds this policy will strive to: 
1.  Maintain the integrity of the woodland feel that provides beauty to city properties. 
2.  Increase ecologic benefits to the community in the way of water retention, air cleansing, heat reduction and increased property values. 
3.  Provide an excellent offset for some of the carbon usage that the city consumes. 
Note: It should be noted that this policy and standard of care is formalizing the practices and procedures that have been taking place for many years, as the city has worked to provide safe premises. 
(3)  Means of inspection: Due to the magnitude of the woodland element of the city grounds, this policy will be performed by the use of an internationally recognized technique called visual tree assessment (VTA). The department proposes to train its maintenance staff members in the elements of VTA so that they can better recognize trees that are structurally unsound and are in need of attention. The department staff will be required to attend training in VTA prior to starting inspections. Training will be available to other city employees. 
a.  The department maintenance staff will use the VTA outline and inspection document attached as (Exhibit 1) to Ord. No. 10-28. 
1.  Visual tree assessment: (VTA) encompasses visual and physical assessment for each tree. Typically, the tree is identified, described, and, sometimes photographed. Findings of the assessment are noted with recommended next steps, such as maintenance, follow-up, monitoring or no action. Areas to be assessed for overall tree health and safety factors are: 
(i)  The ground around the root flare (area where the roots are growing underground). 
(ii)  The root flare itself (sometimes looks like an "elephant's foot"). 
(iii)  The hole or trunk of the tree (also sometimes called the stem). 
(iv)  The limb junctions (where limbs branch off of the trunk). 
(v)  The scaffold branches (big limbs which make up the crown of the tree). 
(vi)  The branches (attached to scaffold branches). 
(vii)  Twigs and fruit that could cause slip and fall accidents. 
(viii)  Miscellaneous hazards, such as thorns, low hanging branch and line-of-sight conflicts that impede the safe flow of traffic. 
2.  Red flags: A visual tree assessment looks for: 
(i)  Obviously rotted, dead or decayed limbs, trunks or roots; 
(ii)  Large holes in trunk; 
(iii)  Broken limbs; 
(iv)  Lightning damage; 
(v)  Storm damage; 
(vi)  Insect infestation; 
(vii)  Wind damage; 
(viii)  Improper trimming or aberrant growth; 
(ix)  Trees too close to the road; 
(x)  Line-of-sight obstructed by vegetation. 
b.  The city also desires a second level of expertise so it proposes to continue to work with a registered consulting arborist, or the equivalent, to assist in assessing trees that are beyond individual staff members' level of expertise. This second level may include the use of, climbing arborist assessment, drill test or other means as necessary and agreed upon by the parks director. 
c.  The department will be encouraged to provide and gather additional information. To do this the department proposes to: 
1.  Educate future park's board members, the tree board, department maintenance staff, and other city employees to look for and report tree problems. 
2.  Place a notice in city newsletters, seeking community comments "We are attempting to regularly inspect our trees so please feel free to alert the Westfield Parks and Recreation Department if you see any tree that raises concern". 
3.  Place a notice and the tree inspection policy on the Westfield Parks and Recreation Department website. 
d.  The Parks director authorizes and recommends: 
1.  A twice annual window/or walking inspection by the department staff with the intent to recognize trees of concern. 
2.  A window/walking inspection following any major weather event. 
3.  A bi-annual walking-window inspection by a registered consulting arborist or equivalent. 
(4)  Standard of assessment: The department proposes to use the following assessment scale so that trees may be dealt with on a fiscally responsible basis. 
a.  The scale: 
1.  Excellent tree-Requires no care. 
2.  Good tree-Requires little care. 
3.  Fair tree-May require future attention. 
4.  Poor tree-Will require attention as time evolves. 
5.  Trees needing mitigation. 
(i)  ASAP-Needs immediate care.

ARTICLE IV. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 62-91. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal and state law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the City of Westfield Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program authorized by the 1972 amendments to the Clean Water Act, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's Rule 13 (327 IAC 15-13), and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's Rule 5 (327 IAC 15-5). The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To prohibit the release of pollutants to the MS4 from construction activity. 
(2)  To prohibit the release of pollutants to the MS4 from post construction runoff. 
(3)  To prohibit illicit discharges into the MS4. 
(4)  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, monitoring, and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(Ord. No. 05-30, § 1, 11-14-05) 
Sec. 62-92. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this article, the following shall mean: 
    Best management practices (BMPs). Structural or nonstructural practices, or a combination of practices, designed to act as effective, practicable means of minimizing the impacts of development and human activities on water quality. Traditional structural BMPs, including extended detention dry ponds, wet ponds, infiltration trenches, and sand filtration systems, are now common elements of most new development projects. Structural BMPs rely heavily on gravitational settling and/or the infiltration of soluble nutrients through a porous medium for pollutant removal. Nonstructural BMPs, which may be used independently or in conjunction with structural BMPs, rely on a much wider breadth of mechanisms to prevent or control NPS pollution. Nonstructural BMPs range from programs that increase public awareness to prevent pollution, to the implementation of control-oriented techniques (such as bioretention and stormwater wetlands) that utilize vegetation to enhance pollutant removal and restore the infiltrative capacity of the landscape. 
    Clean Water Act (CWA). The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), and any subsequent amendments thereto. 
    Construction activity. Activities subject to a stormwater management permit. These include construction projects resulting in land disturbance of one-fourth-acre or more. Such activities include but are not limited to clearing and grubbing, grading, excavating, and demolition. This term does not include routine ditch or road maintenance or minor landscaping projects, agricultural land disturbing activities, forest harvesting activities, or individual building lots within a larger permitted project. 
    Entity. An individual, association, organization, partnership, firm, corporation, or other person or group of persons recognized by law and acting as either the owner or as the owner's agent. 
    Illicit discharge. A direct or indirect non-stormwater or pollutant discharge to the storm drainage system, MS4, or receiving waters except as exempted in section 62-100. 
    Illicit connections. An illicit connection is defined as either of the following: 
A stormwater conveyance system, which allows an illicit discharge to enter the storm drainage system or the MS4, including but not limited to any conveyances which allow any non-stormwater discharge and any connections to the storm drainage system, MS4, or receiving waters from indoor drains and sinks, regardless of whether said drain or connection had been previously allowed, permitted, or approved by the City of Westfield or, any conveyance connected from a commercial or industrial land use to the storm drainage system, MS4, or receiving water which has not been documented in plans, maps, or equivalent records and approved by the City of Westfield. 
    Inspecting authority. A City of Westfield representative or any other person authorized by the City of Westfield to perform inspections. 
    Industrial activity. Activities subject to NPDES industrial permits as defined by 327 IAC 15-6-1:12 (Rule 6). 
    Maximum extent practicable (MEP). The statutory standard that establishes the level of pollutant reductions that operators of regulated MS4s must achieve. The CWA requires that NPDES stormwater discharge permits for discharges from MS4s "shall require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices, control techniques and system, design and engineering methods." This standard applies to all MS4s regulated under the phase I and phase II (Rule 13) stormwater rules. Compliance with the conditions of Rule 13 and the series of steps associated with implementation of the required six-minimum control measures will satisfy the MEP standard. Compliance with the six-minimum control measures requires the development and implementation of BMPs. Implementation of the BMPs includes not only the actions necessary to initiate and continue the use of specific control measures, but also, the enforcement actions, as applicable, to ensure that the implementation of the control measures occurs. 
    Measurable storm event. Means a precipitation event that results in a total measured precipitation accumulation equal to, or greater than, one-half-inch of rainfall. 
    Municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4). A stormwater conveyance system which is owned or operated by a state, city, city, county, tribe, district, association, or other public body or a designated and approved management agency under Section 208 of the Clean Water Act that discharges into waters of the United States (40 CFR 122.26(b)(8)). 
    National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) stormwater discharge permit. A permit issued by EPA (or by a state under authority delegated pursuant to 33 USC § 1342(b)) that authorizes the discharge of pollutants to waters of the United States, whether the permit is applicable on an individual, group, or general area-wide basis. 
    Non-stormwater discharge. Any discharge to the stormwater conveyance system that is not composed entirely of stormwater including, but not limited to: sewage, process wastewater, washwater, water containing pollutants, or any other liquid, other than uncontaminated stormwater, discharged from a facility. 
    Notice of intent (NOI). A written notification indicating an entity's intention to comply with the terms of a specified general permit rule in lieu of applying for an individual NPDES stormwater discharge permit and includes information as required under 327 IAC 15-3 and the applicable general permit rule. 
    Pollutant. Anything that causes or contributes to pollution. Pollutants may include, but are not limited to: paints, varnishes, and solvents; oil and other automotive fluids; non-hazardous liquid and solid wastes; yard wastes, including grass, brush, leaves, and limbs; refuse, rubbish, garbage, litter, or other discarded or abandoned objects, and accumulations, so that same may cause or contribute to pollution; floatables, pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers; hazardous substances and wastes; sewage, fecal coliform and pathogens; dissolved and particulate metals; animal wastes; wastes and residues that result from constructing a building or structure; soil and sediments; and noxious or offensive matter of any kind. 
    Premises. Any building, lot, parcel of land, or portion of land whether improved or unimproved including adjacent sidewalks and parking strips. 
    Receiving waters. Watercourses or waters of the United States, or any body of water into which stormwater is discharged. 
    Storm drainage system. A non-MS4 stormwater conveyance system that ultimately discharges to an MS4. 
    Stormwater conveyance systems. System of subsurface drainage systems, catch basins, and other drainage structures including retention and detention facilities, municipal streets, catch basins, curbs, gutters, roads with subsurface drainage systems, reservoirs, pumped piping systems, other drainage structures or watercourse. 
    Stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP). A document which describes the best management practices and activities to be implemented by an entity to identify sources of pollution or contamination at a site and the actions to eliminate or reduce pollutant discharges to stormwater, stormwater conveyance systems, and/or receiving waters to the maximum extent practicable. 
    Technical review and comment form. A form issued by the city stating the SWPPP is adequate or stating revisions needed in the SWPPP. 
    Trained individual. An individual who is trained and experienced in the principles of stormwater quality, including erosion and sediment control as may be demonstrated by state registration, professional certification, experience, or completion of coursework that enable the individual to make judgments regarding stormwater control or treatment and monitoring. 
    Watercourse. A conduit through which water flows, natural body of running water flowing on or under the earth or a natural or artificial channel through which water flows. 
    Waters of the United States. A term used in federal regulations that defines all water bodies regulated as waters of the U.S. It includes: (1) all waters which may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce; (2) all interstate waters, including interstate wetlands; (3) all other waters, such as intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including intermittent streams), mud flats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural ponds; the use, degradation, or destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign commerce including any such waters; (4) all impoundments of waters otherwise defined as waters of the U.S.; (5) tributaries of waters identified in this section; (6) the territorial seas; (7) wetlands adjacent to waters.

An illicit discharge shall be considered properly reported only if the entity complies with all the requirements of this section. This requirement does not relieve the entity from notifying other agencies as required by state or federal regulations. 
(Ord. No. 05-30, § 18, 11-14-05) 
Sec. 62-108. - Permit requirements and procedures. 
    An approved stormwater management permit shall be obtained prior to the initiation of any construction activities. In order to obtain a stormwater management permit, the applicant shall be the entity responsible for accomplishing the construction activity for which the stormwater management permit was issued. In granting a stormwater management permit, the city may impose such terms and conditions as are reasonably necessary to meet the purpose of this article. The entity shall insure compliance with such terms and conditions. Non-compliance with the terms and conditions of permits will be subject to enforcement as described in section 62-111 of this article. The entity shall inform all general contractors, construction management firms, grading or excavating contractors, utility contractors, and the contractors that have primary oversight on individual building lots of the terms and conditions of the stormwater management permit and the schedule for proposed implementation. 
(1)  The project site owner must submit an application for a stormwater management permit to the City of Westfield and IDEM, including an initial notice of intent (NOI), construction plan sheets, stormwater drainage technical report, a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) for active construction sites, a post-construction SWPPP, and the applicable permit fees to the City of Westfield (City of Westfield's Inspection Fees Ordinance). All plans, reports, calculations, and narratives shall be prepared in accordance with the City of Westfield Utility and Infrastructure Construction Standards and Specifications Manual and signed and sealed by a professional engineer, registered by the State of Indiana. 
(2)  The city will review each application for a stormwater management permit to determine its conformance with the provisions of this article. The city will take one of the following actions: 
a.  Approve the SWPPP for active construction sites and for post-construction and provide a technical review and comment form stating the "plan is adequate". 
b.  Approve the SWPPP for active construction sites and for post-construction subject to such reasonable conditions as may be necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this article, and issue the technical review and comment form stating the "plan is adequate" with said conditions outlined. 
c.  Provide a technical review and comment form stating the "plan is deficient" and indicating the reason(s) and procedure for submitting a revised application and/or submission. 
Any changes or deviations in the detailed plans and specifications after approval of the applicable stormwater management permit shall be filed with, and accepted by, the city prior to the commencement of construction activity involving the change. Applicable plan review fees are due in accordance with the City of Westfield's Inspection Fee Ordinance before any plan will be approved. 
(3)  After receiving a technical review and comment form stating the "plan is adequate", the project site owner must notify the city and IDEM 48 hours before beginning construction. Notification shall be in the form of an updated NOI form along with proof of publication of public notice. The applicant is also responsible for any IDEM-required NOI fee. The publication must include the following: 
"(Company name, address) is submitting an NOI letter to notify the City of Westfield and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management of our intent to comply with the requirements of the City of Westfield Stormwater Management Ordinance, as well as the requirements of 327 IAC 15-5 and 327 IAC 15-13, to discharge stormwater from construction activities for the following project: (name of the construction project, address of the location of the construction project, and Parcel Identification Number). Run-off from the project site will discharge to (stream(s) receiving the discharge(s))." 
Once a permit has been issued and the updated NOI submitted to the city and IDEM 48 hours before beginning construction, construction may commence. A stop work order per section 62-112 shall be issued by the city for all projects that are proceeding without such notification. 
(4)  Once construction starts, the project owner shall monitor construction activities and inspect all stormwater pollution prevention measures in compliance with the city's applicable ordinances and the terms and conditions of the approved permit. Lack of maintenance of stormwater pollution prevention measures during construction or failure to implement the approved SWPPP by the approved schedule of implementation shall constitute a violation of this article, subject to enforcement under the provisions of this article. 
(5)  Upon completion of construction activities, as-built plans must be submitted to the city. 
(6)  The entity must submit a notice of termination (NOT) letter to the city once the construction site has been stabilized and all temporary erosion and sediment control measures have been removed. The city shall inspect the construction site and verify the requirements for an NOT have been met. Once the applicant receives a "verified" copy of the NOT, they must forward a copy to IDEM. 
(Ord. No. 05-30, § 19, 11-14-05) 
Sec. 62-109. - Individual lot plot plan permit requirements and procedures. 
(a)  For individual lots disturbing less than one acre, developed within a larger permitted project, a formal review and issuance of an individual lot plot plan permit will be required before a building permit can be issued. The individual lot owner must complete a residential lot plot plan permit request, containing the certified site layout for the subject lot and an erosion and sediment control plan in accordance with the City of Westfield Utility and Infrastructure Construction Standards and Specifications Manual, the name and contact information for the trained individual in charge of the stormwater pollution prevention self-monitoring program for the individual lot. In submitting the individual lot plot plan for plan review, applicable fees for the permit, plan review, and site inspections are due in accordance with the City of Westfield's Inspection Fee Ordinance. These fees are due before approval for a plan can be issued. The individual lot owner is responsible for installation and maintenance of all erosion and sediment control measures until the site is stabilized. In instances where an NOT has been issued to the developer and there are multiple lots being developed and a violation of this article occurs that cannot be attributed to an individual lot owner, then all lot owners with active construction shall, collectively, be found in violation.

5.4	Economic Development District (EDD) Overlay
	A.	Purpose and Intent:  The purpose of this Article (the "EDD Overlay") is to protect the City and its taxpayers where the City and its taxpayers have been obligated to finance public works projects ("Public Improvements") within an Economic Development Area ("EDA").
		1.	Public Improvements in an EDA are intended to facilitate new development that otherwise may not occur or that may otherwise be delayed without the Public Improvements.
		2.	New development creates additional taxable assessed value and real property taxes. The additional real property taxes generated within an EDA are necessary to finance Public Improvements and eventually lower the tax rates for other City taxpayers.
		3.	The funding of Public Improvements to increase assessed value, and the generation of tax revenue to pay for the Public Improvements has been, and will continue to be, a compelling governmental interest of the City because an increase in the City's tax base will continue to be a benefit for all of the City and its citizens.
		4.	The use of land in an EDA by property owners who are exempt from paying real property taxes ("Tax Exempt Uses") fails to satisfy the primary purpose of an EDA when the EDA was established because a Tax Exempt Use benefits from the Public Improvements without contribution to the tax base that pays for the Public Improvements.
	B.	Applicability:  This Article shall apply to all property and to any petition, application, land use, development or improvements and petition within an Economic Development Area, as established by the City, and as may be amended from time to time in accordance with Indiana law.
	C.	Development Standards:  The development and design standards of the underlying Zoning District, as set forth by this Ordinance, shall otherwise apply to property within an EDD Overlay.
	D.	Restriction of Use:  The use of land within an EDD Overlay that results in the real estate being exempt from payment of all or part of the real property taxes (a "Tax Exempt Use") shall be permitted only as a Special Exception (see also Article 10.11 Special Exceptions). All other uses that are permitted in the underlying Zoning District shall be permitted.
	E.	Exceptions from Restriction of Use:  The following shall be exempt from this Article and shall otherwise be permitted within an EDD Overlay:
		1.	A Tax Exempt Use that is occupying (e.g., leasing from a third party) land or a building that is otherwise owned by a property owner not exempt from payment of all or part of the subject real estate's real property taxes and the occupation by the Tax Exempt Use does not cause the real estate to become exempt from payment of any real property taxes.
		2.	Public Safety and Services Uses.
5.5	Floodplain Overlay District (FOD)
	A.	Applicability:
		1.	This Article shall apply to all Special Flood Hazard Areas and known Flood Prone Areas, as defined herein, within the Jurisdiction of the Plan Commission (the "FOD").

		3.	No land or stream within this Overlay shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of this Article and other applicable regulations.
	B.	Purpose and Intent:  It is the purpose of this Article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
		1.	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
		2.	Require uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
		3.	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters.
		4.	Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage.
		5.	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

The Director or Plan Commission may require crosswalks to be marked at other intersections or pedestrian-crossing points as may be deemed appropriate. All traffic control devices shall comply with guidelines and requirements of the current edition of the Indiana Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
	C.	Internal Pedestrian Network Standards:
		1.	The minimum sidewalk width shall be as indicated in the Thoroughfare Plan or five (5) feet (six (6) feet if immediately abutting the curb), whichever is greater.
		2.	Sidewalks shall be required on both sides on internal Streets and internal Private Streets in all developments.
		3.	When a proposed development lies between or adjacent to existing developments which have been provided with sidewalks, connecting sidewalks or pathways (which are extensions of the existing sidewalks) shall be constructed.
		4.	Connector sidewalks shall be provided from the sidewalk or path adjacent to the Street to the front entrance of all nonresidential structures. Where the sidewalk intersects driving lanes or parking aisles within the Parking Area, then crosswalks and ramps shall be installed in accordance with ADA requirements and such areas shall be delineated (e.g., pavers, stamped, bricked), as determined by the Plan Commission or Director, to reinforce pedestrian safety.
	D.	Perimeter/External Pedestrian Network Standards:  All developments shall participate in the establishment or improvement to the pedestrian network along Streets adjacent to its perimeter in accordance with the following:
		1.	Where a proposed Development Plan or Subdivision abuts an existing Right-of-way, then pedestrian paths, jogging paths, and bicycle paths shall be provided along the perimeter Street(s) or Private Street(s) in accordance with the Thoroughfare Plan. The type of pedestrian facility required shall be as set forth in the Thoroughfare Plan. The County or Public Works Department, as applicable, may waive the requirement for a path along perimeter streets for a Minor Subdivision.
		2.	Generally, all required pedestrian facility improvements shall be located within the Right-of-way. Required improvements located outside of the Right-of-way shall be located within an easement approved by the Director or Public Works Department.
		3.	The Plan Commission or Director may require Developers, at their expense, to construct off-site pedestrian facilities adjacent to the proposed development to respond to the proposed development's impact and infrastructure demands (see also Article 8.9 Street and Right-of-Way Standards as it may apply).
8.8	Storm Water Standards
	A.	All proposed development shall provide for the collection and management of all storm and surface water drainage in accordance with the City's Construction Standards (see Article 7.3 Principles and Standards of Design).

		4.	Access to the basin must be available for cleaning and maintaining.
8.9	Street and Right-of-Way Standards
	A.	Applicability:  All proposed development shall allocate adequate areas for new streets in conformity with Article 7.3 Principles and Standards of Design and the Thoroughfare Plan.
	B.	Thoroughfare Plan:  The Westfield Thoroughfare Plan, a part of the Comprehensive Plan, as amended, (the "Thoroughfare Plan") is hereby declared to be a part of this Ordinance. The Thoroughfare Plan shall be available for review in the office of the Clerk/Treasurer and in the office of the Department.
	C.	Compliance with Thoroughfare Plan:  In addition to meeting requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), all development that adjoins, includes, is served by or affects Streets or alternative transportation corridors bearing a designation on the Thoroughfare Plan shall conform to the requirements of the Thoroughfare Plan in regard to:
		a.	The dedication of Rights-of-way;
		b.	Building Setback Lines; and
		c.	Any other affected development or design standards set forth in the Thoroughfare Plan or this Ordinance.
	D.	Dedication of Right-of-way:  In developments that adjoin or include existing Streets that do not conform to the minimum Right-of-way dimensions established in the Thoroughfare Plan, the Developer shall dedicate additional width along either one or both sides of such Streets sufficient to meet the requirements of the Thoroughfare Plan. If the Developer only controls the property on one (1) side of the Street, then sufficient Right-of-way shall be dedicated to bring the half Right-of-way up to the dimensions required in the Thoroughfare Plan.
		1.	Passing Blister:  Where a passing blister is required and inadequate Right-of-way exists to install the passing blister, then the Developer shall make a good faith effort to acquire property sufficient for the installation of the passing blister. If the Property Owner on which the passing blister is to be installed refuses to sell the property, then the Developer shall provide the Department copies of all surveys, appraisals, written offers made by the Developer to the Property Owner, and correspondence from the Property Owner.
		2.	Acceleration and Deceleration Lanes:  Where an acceleration lane and/or deceleration lane is required and the Developer does not control street frontage adequate to install the lane, then the Developer shall make a good faith effort to acquire property sufficient for the installation of the acceleration lane and/or a deceleration lane. If the Property Owner on which the acceleration lane and/or a deceleration lane is to be installed refuses to sell the property, then the Developer shall provide the Department copies of all surveys, appraisals, written offers made by the Developer to the Property Owner, and correspondence from the Property Owner.
		3.	Eminent Domain:  Whereas the installation of passing blisters, acceleration lanes, and deceleration lanes is vital to the health, safety, and welfare of the motoring public, the City may begin eminent domain proceedings in accordance with IC 32-24: Eminent Domain for the acquisition of public right-of-way sufficient for the installation of the passing blister, acceleration lane, and/or deceleration lane upon receipt of the aforementioned documentation illustrating the Developer's failure to acquire the needed property. Upon completion of the eminent domain proceedings, the Developer shall reimburse the City in an amount equal to the price paid by the City for the public Right-of-way and associated professional nad legal expenses, anything that had to be condemned within the acquired Right-of-way, and anything for which the City paid the price of relocation.
		4.	Installation of Improvements:  The Developer shall then install the passing blister, acceleration lane, and/or deceleration lane in accordance with the City's Construction Standards (see Article 7.3 Principles and Standards of Design).
	E.	Private Streets:
		1.	Standards:  Private Streets are permitted, but shall conform to the Street and Right-of-way standards of this Ordinance and shall be constructed in accordance with the City's Construction Standards.
		2.	Private Street Easements:  Private Streets shall be stablished in access easements that may be placed in common area, rather than Rights-of-way, that comply with Article 8.3 Easement Standards.
		3.	Platted Private Streets:  When a Private Street easement appears on a Secondary Plat, then a Private Streets certificate (see Article 8.3 Easement Standards) shall be printed on the plan or plat. Unplatted easements for Private Streets shall have the same language included on the recorded easement instrument.
		4.	Financial Sureties:  Shall be required in accordance with Article 8.12 Surety Standards and the City's Construction Standards.

The easement shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet wide and ten (10) feet deep. The easement and Right-of-way adjacent to the easement shall be free of above ground improvements (e.g., driveways, mailboxes, fire hydrants, landscaping and Public Utility Installations), unless otherwise approved by the Public Works Department, in order to accommodate snow removal maintenance of the cul-de-sac.
			d.	Dead-end Streets:  A temporarily dead-ended Street shall be permitted if a Street is proposed to be and should logically be extended but is not yet constructed. An adequate easement or Right-of-way for a turn-around shall be provided which extends one hundred and fifty (150) feet or more in length. If an easement, then such easement shall be automatically vacated to abutting Property Owners when the street is legally extended.
			e.	Pedestrian Connection:  The Plan Commission or Director may require a pathway or sidewalk to connect one cul-de-sac to an adjacent cul-de-sac or Street to provide reasonably direct connection between likely pedestrian destinations. Such connection shall be constructed in accordance with Article 8.7 Pedestrian Network Standards and located within an easement or common area.
		4.	Alleys:  Alleys shall be constructed in accordance with the City's Construction Standards, unless otherwise approved by the Public Works Department.
		5.	Intersections:

			b.	Lot Line corners shall be rounded by arcs with minimum radii in accordance with Article 7.3 Principles and Standards of Design.
		6.	Access Points:  The following standards shall apply; however, the Plan Commission, Council, or Public Works Department may otherwise approve access points if deemed appropriate to improve traffic circulation in the area or due to the size of the development:
			a.	The primary access for a multi-family development shall be from an Arterial, if available, and at least two (2) access points shall be provided for adequate accessibility for emergency vehicles and school busses.
			b.	Developments shall not be designed to permit direct access by a driveway to any Arterial or Collector, unless such design accommodates the Lot's only means of access.
		7.	Curved Streets:  Minimum visibility (horizontal and vertical), curvature radii, and tangents on reversed curves on curved Streets shall comply with Article 7.3 Principles and Standards of Design.
		8.	Traffic Control Devices:  All traffic control devices shall comply with guidelines and requirements of the current edition of the Indiana Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

9.1	Purpose and Intent
	Upon the adoption of the Westfield Washington Township Zoning Ordinance of 1977 and Zoning Map, and amendments thereto, and potentially upon other government action (e.g., acquisition of Right-of-way), some buildings, Structures, Lots and uses may no longer conform to the regulations of the Zoning District in which they are located. This Chapter has been generated, for this reason, to provide the rules, policies and regulations that apply to these buildings, structures, Lots and users.
9.2	Legal Nonconforming and Illegal Nonconforming
	A.	Illegal Nonconforming:  A Building, Structure, or Lot which was constructed or is being used without an approved Building Permit, Improvement Location Permit or approval from the Board or Plan Commission is considered illegal nonconforming when it does not conform to this Ordinance. An illegal nonconforming property shall be subject to enforcement and penalties as set forth in CHAPTER 11:  ENFORCEMENT & PENALTIES, and all other applicable State or Municipal law, and shall be altered to conform with all applicable standards and regulations of this Ordinance.
	B.	Legal Nonconforming:  Legal nonconforming is different than illegal nonconforming because a legal nonconforming property is caused by an amendment to this Ordinance, not as a result of a change to the property, that has resulted in the property no longer conforming to the policies and standards of the applicable Zoning District. When this situation occurs, then the property is deemed legal nonconforming if changes to the property are a result of improvements and/or changes to Rights-of-way adjacent to the property (e.g., streets, trails) and such improvements and/or changes to Rights-of-way cause the property to no longer conform to the policies and standards of the applicable Zoning District.
9.3	Nonconforming Buildings and Structures
	A.	A Legal Nonconforming Building or Structure shall be deemed as such for any Building or Structure that:  (i) has been continuously occupied and legally existed prior to the enactment of this Ordinance, or an amendment thereto; and (ii) no longer conforms to the regulations set forth in this Ordinance, or its subsequent amendments.
	B.	A Legal Nonconforming Building or Structure may continue provided it remains the same or fits within the below described tolerances:
		1.	A Legal Nonconforming Building or Structure shall not be enlarged or altered in a manner that the enlargement or alteration increases its nonconformity; however, the Building or Structure, or portion thereof, may be altered to maintain or decrease its nonconformity.
		2.	A Legal Nonconforming Building and Structure deliberately damaged or deliberately destroyed by more than fifty percent (50%) of its fair market value shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the Zoning District in which it is located.
		3.	A Legal Nonconforming Building or Structure damaged or destroyed through natural disaster or a nondeliberate action may be reconstructed to the state and configuration as it existed immediately prior to the damage or destruction, except as otherwise regulated by Article 5.5 Floodplain Overlay District (FOD).
	C.	If a Legal Nonconforming Building or Structure is moved for any reason, for any distance, then it shall thereafter conform to the provisions of this Ordinance.

A Legal Nonconforming Lot shall be deemed as such for any Lot that:  (i) was established and recorded prior to the date of passage of the Westfield Washington Township Zoning Ordinance of December 20, 1977; and (ii) no longer conforms to the regulations set forth in this Ordinance, or its subsequent amendments, as applicable to Lots (e.g., Lot Area, Lot Width, Lot Depth, Lot Frontage).
	B.	A Legal Nonconforming Lot within the geographic area identified in FIGURE 9.4(1):  DOWNTOWN AREA may be:  (i) used as permitted by the Zoning District in which the Lot is located; and (ii) built upon, only if the Lot and improvements otherwise comply with all other standards of this Ordinance.
	C.	A Legal Nonconforming Lot not within the geographic area identified in FIGURE 9.4(1):  DOWNTOWN AREA may be:  (i) used as permitted by the Zoning District in which the Lot is located; and (ii) built upon, only if the Lot and improvements otherwise comply with all other standards of this Ordinance, and provided that:

		2.	The Lot Width is no less than one hundred (100) feet; and
		3.	The Lot Area is no less than one (1) acre.
	D.	A Legal Nonconforming Lot is no longer deemed a Legal Nonconforming Lot if the Lot has been combined into a Lot or parcel that fully conforms with the standards of the Zoning District. A Legal Nonconforming Lot shall retain its Legal Nonconforming status if combined with another Legal Nonconforming Lot resulting in increased conformity of the Lot. Once combined with another Lot, a Legal Nonconforming Lot shall not thereafter be subdivided except when the resulting Lots are in full compliance with this Ordinance.
9.5	Nonconforming Uses, Land, or Structures and Land in Combination
	A.	A Legal Nonconforming use of Structures, land, or Structures and land in combination (collectively, "Legal Nonconforming Use") shall be deemed a Legal Nonconforming Use if it:  (i) was established prior to the date of passage of the Westfield Washington Township Zoning Ordinance of December 20, 1977; (ii) does not conform to the regulations set forth in this Ordinance, or its subsequent amendments; (iii) no longer is a permitted use in the applicable Zoning District in which it is located.
	B.	A Legal Nonconforming Use may continue provided that it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following conditions:
		1.	No existing Structure devoted to a Legal Nonconforming Use shall be enlarged, expanded, increased, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered unless it:
			a.	Complies with this Chapter for limited and small expansions;
			b.	Changes the use of the Structure to a use permitted by the Zoning District in which it is located; or
			c.	Changes the use to a less intensive nonconforming use and is approved by the Director or Plan Commission.
		2.	No new Building or Structure shall be constructed in connection with an existing Legal Nonconforming Use.
		3.	A Legal Nonconforming Use of a Building or Structure may be extended throughout any parts of a Building or Structure which were plainly arranged or designed for such use prior the effective date of this Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the Building or Structure.
		4.	A Structure being used by a Legal Nonconforming Use may be expanded an aggregate of up ten percent (10%) of the original Gross Floor Area, as it existed prior the effective date of this Ordinance. Expansions shall otherwise conform to all applicable standards of this Ordinance, unless a variance is granted by the Board.
		5.	If no structural alterations are made, then a Legal Nonconforming Use may be changed to another Legal Nonconforming Use, provided the use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the Zoning District than the existing Legal Nonconforming Use requires more parking than the previous use, as set forth by Article 6.14 Parking and Loading Standards, then such new use shall comply with Article 6.14 Parking and Loading Standards, as determined by the Director.
		6.	If a Legal Nonconforming Use is discontinued or abandoned for twelve (12) consecutive months, except when government action impedes access to the premises, then any subsequent use of such land, Structure or land and Structure shall conform to the provisions of this Ordinance.
		7.	A Legal Nonconforming Use superseded by a permitted use shall lost its legal nonconforming status and shall not thereafter be resumed.
		8.	Removal or destruction of a Structure in which a Legal Nonconforming Use existed shall result in the property losing its legal nonconforming status and shall not thereafter be resumed. Destruction is defined as deliberate damage of more than fifty percent (50%) of the Structure's fair market value at the time of destruction.
9.6	Nonconforming Signs
	A.	A Legal Nonconforming Sign shall be deemed as such for any Sign that:  (i) lawfully existing on the effective date of this Ordinance, or amendment thereto; and (ii) no longer conforms to all standards and regulations of this Ordinance.
	B.	Legal Nonconforming Signs shall be permitted to remain until such time as:  (i) a major change is made to the Sign; (ii) any new Sign is proposed for the property upon which the nonconforming Sign is located; or, (iii) the Sign is taken down for maintenance and repair and is down for longer than thirty (30) days. Major changes for purposes of this Section shall include replacement of the Sign Copy, changing the size, changing the height, adding lights, altering light intensity, and/or relocation. The replacement of individual tenant panels on a Nonresidential Center sign shall not constitute a major change.
	C.	Legal Nonconforming Signs shall comply with the Maintenance and Repair requirements found in Article 6.17 Sign Standards and shall be kept in good repair, safe, neat, clean and attractive condition. If Legal Nonconforming Signs are not kept in said condition for a period exceeding six (6) consecutive months or are demolished by any force whatsoever to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of the fair market value of the Sign, including its structure, then the Sign(s) shall lose its legal nonconforming status and shall conform to this Ordinance.
	D.	A Legal Nonconforming Sign shall be removed by the owner or lessee of the premises upon which the Sign is located when the business it advertises is no longer conducted on the premises. If the Property Owner or lessee fails to remove the Sign, then the Plan Commission or Director shall give the Property Owner thirty (30) days written notice to remove it. Upon failure to comply with this notice, the Plan Commission or Director may remove the sign at cost to the Property Owner or lessee.

	B.	If a Building or Structure or portion of a Building or Structure were to become unsafe or condemned due to lack of repairs or maintenance, and is declared by an authorized official to be unsafe or condemned due to physical condition; then the Building or Structure shall be restored, repaired, rebuilt or entirely demolished within six (6) months of the declaration. If the Building or Structure is not restored, or rebuilt within the six (6) months, then the Building or Structure shall lost its Legal Nonconforming status and any future improvements shall conform to the standards and regulations of this Ordinance.
	C.	If a Building or Structure becomes unsafe or unlawful due to physical condition and is razed, then the Building or Structure shall be rebuilt in conformity with the Zoning District in which it is located.
	D.	Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening, repairing, or restoring to a safe condition of any Building or Structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting public safety upon order of such official.

	B.	Application:  Application and informational packets may be obtained through the Department and/or online through the City's website.
	C.	Fees:  Fees shall be paid in accordance with the Fee Schedule, as set forth in Article 3.1 General Administration. No permit shall be granted by the Department until all applicable fees pertaining to that permit have been paid in full. No permit shall be granted by the Department until all fees and fines owed by the Applicant to the City have been paid in full. This requirement shall apply not only to fees and fines specific to the individual application, but shall also include all fees and fines owed on any permit previously issued to the Applicant. A schedule of payment of all owed fees provided by the Applicant to the satisfaction of the Director shall satisfy the requirement of this section in lieu of payment in full.
	D.	Public Meetings:  Applications requiring public meetings shall be filed in accordance with the adopted Schedule of Meeting and Filing Dates, as set forth in Article 3.1 General Administration and subject to the Rules of Procedure of the applicable hearing body.
10.2	Administrative Determination
	A.	Purpose:  The interpretation authority established by this Ordinance is intended to recognize that the provisions of this Ordinance, though detailed and extensive, cannot, as a practical matter, address every specific situation to which they may have to be applied. Many such situations can be readily addressed by an interpretation of the specific provisions of this Ordinance in light of the general and specific purposes for which those provisions have been enacted. Because the interpretation authority established is an administrative rather than a legislative authority, it is not intended to add to or change the essential content of this Ordinance but is intended only to allow authoritative application of that content to specific cases.
	B.	Authority:  The Director may be written order, subject to the procedures, standards, and limitations of this Ordinance, render interpretations of the provisions of this Ordinance and of any rule or regulation issued pursuant to it ("Administrative Interpretation") or "Administrative Determination").
	C.	Parties Entitled to Seek Interpretations:  Applications for interpretations may be filed by any person having a legal or equitable interest in property that gives rise to the need for an interpretation; provided that interpretations shall not be sought by any person based solely on hypothetical circumstances or where the interpretation would have no effect other than as an advisory opinion.
	D.	Procedure for Review and Decision
		1.	Application:  Applications for interpretations of this Ordinance shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of this Article.
		2.	Action on Application:  Within ten (10) working days following the receipt of a properly completed application, the Director shall inform the Applicant in writing of his/her determination, stating the specific precedent, reasons, and analysis upon which the determination is based. The failure of the Director to act within ten (10) working days, or such further time to which the Applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying the application rendered on the day following such ten (10) day period.
		3.	Records:  A record of all applications for determinations shall be kept on file in the office of the Director and may, at the Director's discretion, be required to be recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Hamilton County, Indiana.
		4.	Appeal:  Appeals from interpretations rendered by the Director may be made in accordance with Article 10.3 Appeals of Administrative Decisions.
	E.	Standards for interpretations:  The following standards shall govern the Director, and the Board of appeals from the Director, in issuing determinations:
		1.	No determination shall permit any use in any Zoning District unless evidence shall be presented that demonstrates that it will comply with the general regulations established for that particular Zoning District;
		2.	No determination shall permit any use in Zoning District unless such use is similar to other uses permitted in the Zoning District and is more similar to those uses than to uses permitted in a more restrictive Zoning District;
		3.	If a proposed use is most similar to a use permitted only as a Special Exception in the Zoning District in which it is proposed to be located, then any determination permitting such use shall be conditioned on the approval of the Special Exception pursuant to Article 10.11 Special Exceptions; and
		4.	No determination shall permit the establishment of any use that would be inconsistent with the purpose and intent of the Zoning District.
	F.	Effect of Favorable Interpretations:  No determination shall authorize the establishment of a use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by this Ordinance and ordinances of the City including, but not limited to, a Building Permit, a Certificate of Occupancy, Primary and Secondary Plats, or Development Plan approval.
	G.	Limitations on Interpretations:  A determination shall be limited only to the particular circumstance for which it was issued, and such determination shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar circumstance for which a separate determination has not been issued, unless otherwise provided for in the determination.
10.3	Appeals of Administrative Decisions
	A.	Right of Appeal:  The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant an appeal of any decision, interpretation, or determination made by the Director, or any other administrative official or board charged with the duty of enforcing and interpreting this Ordinance. The procedure set forth in this Article shall apply to all appeals of administrative decisions, unless otherwise set forth by local or Indiana law.
	B.	Stay of Enforcement:  If an appeal is filed in accordance with this Article, then the enforcing party shall take no further action on the matter pending the Board's decision, except for unsafe circumstances which present an immediate and serious danger to the public.
	C.	Application:  The Applicant shall submit an administrative appeal application within thirty (30) days of when the decision, interpretation, or determination was made, along with the required supporting information. Supporting information shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
		1.	Original Submittals:  Copies of all materials upon which the decision being appealed was based.
		2.	Written Decisions:  Copies of any written decisions that are the subject of the appeal.
		3.	Appeal Basis:  A letter describing the reasons for the appeal noting specific sections of this Ordinance or other applicable standards upon which the appeal is based.
	D.	Board Review:  The Board will then, at a meeting scheduled consistent with the adopted Schedule of Meeting and Filing Dates, review the administrative appeal application and supporting information.
		1.	Representation:  The Applicant and/or any representative of the appellant must be present at the meeting to present the appeal.
		2.	Testimony:  The Board shall consider at the meeting a report from the Department and/or enforcing party, testimony from the Applicant, and/or testimony from witnesses.
		3.	Procedures:  The presentation of reports and testimony and all other aspects of the meeting shall be consistent with the Rules and Procedures of the Board.
	E.	Board Action:  The Board may affirm, affirm with modifications, reverse, or continue to appeal.
		1.	Affirm:  If the Board finds the administrative decision was consistent with the provisions of this Ordinance, then the Board shall affirm the determination in writing.
		2.	Affirm with Modifications:  If the Board determines the proper interpretation of the provision(s) of this Ordinance that are subject to the appeal is consistent with neither the administrative decision nor the required interpretation of the Applicant, then the Board may affirm the determination with modifications.
		3.	Reverse:  If the Board finds the administrative decision was inconsistent with the provisions of this Ordinance, then the Board shall reverse the determination in writing.
		4.	Continuances:  The appeal may be continued based on a request by the Department or Applicant; an indecisive vote; or a determination by the Board that additional information is required prior to action being taken on the request. The continuing of all applications shall be consistent with the Rules and Procedures of the Board.

	A.	Applicability:  An application for a Certificate of Compliance ("CofC") may be filed in accordance with this Article. A CofC:  (i) may be required as set forth by this Ordinance; (ii) may serve as a written confirmation by the City that a property or use complies with this Ordinance, as may be requested by an Applicant; (iii) may serve as a written verification of a property's zoning, as may be requested by an Applicant; and, (iv) shall be required for:
		1.	A change in use (e.g., change from residential to commercial, change to a Special Handling Retail use).
		2.	Exterior building or site improvements that would not otherwise require an Improvement Location Permit or Development Plan approval.

	B.	Application:  An Applicant shall submit a completed application, on forms provided by the Department, or a detailed written request to the Department with supporting information. Applications, requests, plans, and specifications filed by an Applicant shall be checked by the Department for compliance with this Ordinance. If the Department is satisfied that the property, plans and information provided in the application conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance and other applicable laws and ordinances, then the Department shall issue a Certificate of Compliance to the Applicant.
	C.	Effect:  No CofC shall authorize the establishment of a use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely certify compliance of an existing property, use and/or improvements thereon made in accordance with an approved permit. The filing and processing of applications for any permits and approvals may be required by this Ordinance and ordinances of the City including, but not limited to, a Building Permit, a Certificate of Occupancy, Primary and Secondary Plats, or Development Plan approval, for proposed improvements or uses.
	D.	Limitations:  A CofC shall be limited only to the particular circumstance for which it was issued and at the time it was issued, and the CofC shall not be deemed to authorize and allegedly similar circumstance for which a separate review or certificate has not been issued or change in circumstances, unless otherwise provided for in the CofC.
	E.	Records of Certificate of Compliance:  Every CofC issued pursuant to this Article shall be kept on file in the office of the Department and copies shall be furnished upon request to any person having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the building or land affected.
10.5	Certificate of Occupancy
	A.	Authority:  It shall be unlawful to use, occupy, or permit the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed, converted, or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a Certificate of Occupancy ("CofO") shall have been issued by the Department. The CofO shall state that the proposed use of the building and/or land conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance and that the Department has inspected the property and attested to that fact.
	B.	Applicability:  Applications for a CofO shall be filed in accordance with this Article and shall be applied for coincidentally with the application for an Improvement Location Permit within ten (10) days after the lawful erection, reconstruction or structural alteration of such building or other improvement of the land shall have been completed.
	C.	Issuance of Certificate of Occupancy:  A CofO may be issued by the Department within ten (10) days after notification by the Applicant that the lawful erection, reconstruction, or structural alteration of such building or other improvement of the land shall have been completed and the finding of the Department that such erection, reconstruction, or structural alteration is complete.
	D.

See also CHAPTER 11:  ENFORCEMENT & PENALTIES.
	E.

10.7	Development Plan Review
	A.	Authority:	A Development Plan review process, as set forth herein, is hereby established to ensure adherence to the standards of this Ordinance. Development Plan applications shall be generally considered favorably by the Plan Commission and Department.
	B.	Purpose:  The purpose of the Development Plan review process is to:  (i) promote innovation and creativity in the design of the built environment; and, (ii) assure the compatibility of new development or major additions to existing development with the surrounding community.
	C.	Applicability:  The Development Plan review process shall be necessary prior to any:  (i) new construction; (ii) building additions; (iii) new or expanded surface Parking Areas; (iv) new or expanded impervious surface areas; (IV) renovation or improvements to a previously approved development plan; (v) exterior building renovations; or, (vi) any other improvements that require an Improvement Location Permit.
		1.	Exception:  Individual Single-family Dwellings shall not require Detailed Development Plan approval in accordance with this Article; rather, the Building Permit review process (see also Article 10.8 Improvement Location Permit) shall serve as the Detailed Development Plan.
		2.	Transition Rules:
			a.	Previously Approved Development Plans:  A development plan or site plan approved by the Plan Commission prior to the adoption of this Ordinance shall be deemed to be an approved Detailed Development Plan; except for development plans approved by the Plan Commission for single-family developments, which shall be deemed as approved Overall Development Plans.
			b.	Existing Lots without Approved Development Plans or Site Plans:  New improvements or changes to existing improvements on a Lot which has lawfully developed, but did not receive approval of a development plan or site plan by the Plan Commission, shall require Detailed Development Plan approval, pursuant to this Article. Overall Development Plan approval shall only be required in this case if the proposed developments results in a Major Subdivision.
	D.	Approvals Required:  The approval of a Development Plan is a two step process that includes the approval of an Overall Development Plan and the approval of a Detailed Development Plan, as set forth herein. The approval or disapproval of both an Overall and a Detailed Development Plan is hereby delegated to the Plan Commission.
		1.	Overall Development Plan:  The purpose of the Overall Development Plan is to preliminarily divide property into Lots, Blocks or Common Area and to ensure compliance with the standards of this Ordinance with regard to Lots (e.g., size, access, general building envelopes), common areas (e.g., perimeter landscaping, shared signage) and shared infrastructure (e.g., drives, streets, cross-access, utilities, drainage). An Overall Development Plan does not include the review of the site layout or building design of individual building Lots; rather, it is intended to generally review Lots, common areas, public spaces and shared infrastructure so that adequate consideration is given to ensure a coordinated development prior to subdividing the property.
		2.	Detailed Development Plan:  The purpose of the Detailed Development Plan is to clearly define all construction matters and special conditions such as construction techniques, specific building locations and design (e.g., architecture), and specific site design (e.g., landscaping, parking, signage, lighting) for an individual Lot or Block.
	E.	Development Plan Review Criteria:  Development Plans shall comply with and be reviewed by the Plan Commission upon finding that the Development Plan is in compliance with the following requirements:
		1.	Compliance with all applicable development and design standards of the Zoning District in which the real estate is located.
		2.	Compliance with all applicable provisions of any Overlay District in which the real estate is located.
		3.	Management of traffic will be in a manner that creates conditions favorable to health, safety, convenience, and the harmonious development of the community such that:
			a.	The design and location of proposed street and highway access points shall minimize safety hazards and congestion.
			b.	The capacity of adjacent streets and highways is sufficient to safely and efficiently accept traffic that will be generated by the new development.
			c.	The entrances, streets and internal traffic circulation facilities in the proposed development are compatible with existing and planned streets and adjacent development.
		4.	The applicable utilities have sufficient capacity to provide potable water, sanitary sewer facilities, electricity, telephone, natural gas, and cable service at a satisfactory level of service to meet the needs of the proposed development.
	F.	Overall Development Plan Approval Process:
		1.	Application Procedures:
			a.	Pre-Filing Conference:  A pre-filing conference with the Department is required prior to the filing of any Development Plan application. The Applicant is encouraged to incorporate the Department's comments into the design of the project prior to the filing the application.
			b.	Who May File:  Applications may be filed by a petition signed by the Property Owners of the real estate involved in the petition, or the Property Owner's authorized agent. If an authorized agent, then a consent form signed by the Property Owner and notarized shall accompany the application.
			c.	Filing Deadline:  Applications shall be filed in accordance with the Schedule of Meetings and Filing Deadlines. The Applicant shall be responsible for distributing a copy of the application and Development Plan to members of the Technical Advisory Committee.
			d.	Forms of Filing:  An Applicant shall submit a completed application to the Department on forms provided by the Department with documentation and supporting information as set forth in this Article.
			e.	Specifying Waiver Request:  All Development Plans shall specify and detail any waivers requested pursuant to Article 7.3 Principles and Standards of Design. Any waiver of standard shall not be considered unless specifically requested and presented to the Plan Commission for its consideration, even if it is otherwise identified on the Development Plan.
			f.	Docketing by Department:  Each Development Plan filed shall be reviewed for completeness. All Development Plans which are determined to be in proper form pursuant to the guidelines established by the Department shall be numbered and docketed by the Department for an initial hearing by the Plan Commission.
		2.	Investigation of Petitions:  The Technical Advisory Committee may review any Development Plan, at the Director's determination, prior to the Plan Commission's consideration. The Department may submit a written report to the Plan Commission stating any facts concerning the physical characteristics of the area involved in the Development Plan, together with a recital of surrounding land use and public facilities available to service the area, or other pertinent facts. The report may also contain opinions of the Department concerning the proposal contained in the Development Plan and a report from members of the Technical Advisory Committee. A copy of such statement shall be made available to the Applicant and all remonstrators of record, if any.
		3.	Amendments Prior to Public Hearing:  Amendments to a Development Plan to be considered at the public hearing must be received by the Department in accordance with the Schedule of Meeting and Filing Deadlines, to allow for the Department's written report to include comments and recommendations related to plans that may have been amended in response to comments provided by the Department or the Technical Advisory Committee.

Permitted:  The Board of Zoning Appeals may approve a use listed as a Special Exception in CHAPTER 13:  USE TABLE, and their Accessory Buildings and uses, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article, and other regulations applicable to the Zoning District in which the subject property is located.
	B.	Purpose:  A Special Exception is a use that requires a greater degree of scrutiny and review because of its potential adverse impact upon the immediate neighborhood and the community. The Board reviews a Special Exception and its characteristics and impacts to determine its suitability in a given location for the Zoning Districts in which it is permitted. The determination of whether the Special Exception is approved shall be contingent upon:  (i) the Special Exception meeting the standards of this Ordinance and those standards as set forth in this Article; and (ii) the Board weighing, in each case, the public need and benefit against the local impact, giving effect to the proposals of the Applicant for ameliorating adverse impacts through special site planning and development techniques and contributions to the provisions of public improvements, sites, right-of-way and services.
	C.	Procedures:
		1.	Application:  Applications shall be made in writing on forms prescribed by the Department with documentation and supporting information the Department determines is necessary to assure compliance with this Ordinance.
		2.	Action by the Director:  The Director shall review a filed application for completeness. All applications which are determined to be in proper form shall be docketed by the Department for a hearing by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
		3.	Investigation of Application:  The Technical Advisory Committee may review any Special Exception prior to the Board's consideration.
		4.	Public Notice:  Notification for the scheduled public hearing regarding the application shall be completed consistent with the Schedule of Meeting and Filing Dates and the Rules and Procedures of the Board.
		5.	Public Hearing:  The Board will then, in a public hearing scheduled consistent with the Schedule of Meeting and Filing Dates, review the particular facts and circumstances of each application and supporting information.
		6.	Board Decision:  Following the public hearing, the Board shall direct the Director to either:  (i) reject the application; or (ii) approve, or approve with conditions, the application if the Board finds adequate evidence is shown that the Special Exception meets the criteria set forth herein.
	D.	Review Criteria:  A Special Exception may be approved by the Board only upon a determination in writing that the Special Exception at the proposed location meets the following:
		1.	The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the Special Exception will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.
		2.	The Special Exception will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to:  (i) not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted; (ii) not substantially diminish and impair property value within the neighborhood; (iii) be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended character of the immediate vicinity; and (iv) not change the essential character of the area.
		3.	The establishment of the Special Exception will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses permitted in the Zoning District.
		4.	Adequate public facilities and services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer, and schools have been or are being provided and the Special Exception will not result in excessive additional requirements at public expense for such public facilities and services.
		5.	Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress designed to minimize traffic congestion and have vehicular approaches are designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding rights-of-way.
		6.	The Special Exception will be harmonious with and in accordance with the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
		7.	The Special Exception will be located in a Zoning District where such use is permitted and that all other requirements of the Zoning District and this Ordinance, and as may be applicable to such use, will be met.
	E.	No Presumption of Approval:  The listing of a Special Exception as a permitted use does not constitute an assurance or presumption that such Special Exception will be approved. Rather, each Special Exception shall be evaluated on an individual basis, in relation to its compliance with the standards and conditions set forth herein, in order to determine whether approval of the Special Exception is appropriate at the particular location and in the particular manner proposed.
	F.	Limitations of Approval:  The approval of a Special Exception by the Board shall be deemed to authorize only that particular use at that particular location for which the approval was granted. Except when otherwise provided by the Board's approval of the Special Exception, a Special Exception shall be deemed to relate to, and be for the benefit of, the use and Lot in question, rather than the Property Owner or operator of such use or Lot.
	G.	Effect of Approval:  The approval of a Special Exception by the Board shall not authorize the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing and processing of applications for such permits or approvals as may be required, which may include but is not limited to approval of Development Plan, Improvement Location Permit, Building Permit and a Certificate of Occupancy.
	H.	Existing Use:  An existing use which is listed herein as a Special Exception, and which is located in a Zoning District in which such Special Exception may be permitted, is a conforming use, providing such use meets the minimum Lot Area requirements set forth in the respective Zoning District. Any expansion of such Special Exception involving the enlargement of buildings, structures, and land area devoted to such use, shall be subject to the requirements and procedures described in this Ordinance.
	I.	Conditions:  In granting a Special Exception, the Board may prescribe conditions and limitations concerning the use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, parking and other matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this Ordinance upon the premises benefited by a Special Exception as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject property or upon public facilities and services. Any conditions prescribed by the Board shall be recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Hamilton County, Indiana. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this Ordinance and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the Special Exception or related Improvement Location Permit, pursuant to CHAPTER 11:  ENFORCEMENT & PENALTIES.
