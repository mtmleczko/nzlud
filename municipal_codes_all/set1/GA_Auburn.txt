AUBURN, GEORGIA - MUNICIPAL CODE 2005 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Auburn, Georgia 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 5, 2-09 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The Auburn Georgia Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1993, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Glenn P. Stephens, city attorney. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 5, 2-09 legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific Code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 19-002, passed February 7, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 5, 2-09, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 5, 2-09 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 5, 2-09, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As of Supplement No. 5, 209, when new pages are inseted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 31, 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2, 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

A.  Conditions for Use. All contracts of the city shall be awarded by competitive sealed bidding except as otherwise provided in Sections 3.04.030, 3.04.040, 3.04.050, 3.04.060 and 3.04.070. 
B.  Invitation for Bids. An invitation for bids shall be issued and shall include specifications, and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement. 
C.  Public Notice. Adequate public notice of the invitation for bids shall be given a reasonable time, not less than fifteen calendar days prior to the date set forth therein for the opening of bids. Such notice may include publication in a newspaper of general circulation a reasonable time prior to bid opening. The public notice shall state the place, date and time of bid opening. 
D.  Bid Opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. The amount of each bid, and such other relevant information as the city clerk deems appropriate, together with the name of each bidder shall be recorded; the record and each bid shall be open to public inspection. 
E.  Bid Acceptance and Bid Evaluation. Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this chapter. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which may include criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose. The criteria, which will affect the bid price and be considered in evaluation for award, shall be objectively measurable, such as discounts, transportation costs, and total or life cycle costs. The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that are not set forth in the invitation for bids. 
F.  Correction or Withdrawal of Bids-Cancellation of Awards. Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes, may be permitted where appropriate. Mistakes discovered before bid opening may be modified or withdrawn by written or telegraphic notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to the time set for bid opening. After bid opening, corrections in bids shall be permitted only to the extent that the bidder can show by clear and convincing evidence that a mistake of a nonjudgmental character was made, the nature of the mistake, and the bid price actually intended. After bid opening, no changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the city or fair competition shall be permitted. In lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw the bid if: 
1.  The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; 
2.  The bidder submits evidence, which clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made. All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids, or to cancel awards or contracts based on bid mistakes, shall be supported by a written determination made by the city clerk or council designee. 
G.  Award. The contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by appropriate written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. In the event the low responsive and responsible bid for a construction project exceeds available funds as certified by the appropriate fiscal officer, and such bid does not exceed such finds by more than five percent, the city clerk is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude re-solicitation of work of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price with the low responsive and responsible bidder, in order to bring the bid within the amount of available finds. Any such negotiated adjustment shall be based only upon eliminating independent deductive items specified in the invitation for bids. 
H.  Multi-Step Sealed Bidding. When it is considered impractical to initially prepare a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been determined to be technically acceptable under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation. 
I.  When it is possible to purchase an item or service using the state of Georgia contract, as provided for under Georgia law, and the department head has determined that competitive bidding will not provide any advantage in quality or price, the department head shall be permitted to use the state of Georgia contract, if the budget provides for the purchase of the item or service.

As provided in the request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to assure fill understanding of, and conformance to, the solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals and such revisions may be permitted after submissions and prior to award for the purpose of obtaining best and final offerors. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of the identity of competing offerors or of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors. 
C.  Award.

Neither the provisions of this section, nor any bond accepted by the city pursuant hereto, nor any damages recovered by the city thereunder shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the grantee, or limit the liability of the grantee under any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter. 
E.  Comprehensive Liability Insurance. Upon acceptance of such franchise grantee shall file with the city clerk and shall thereafter during the entire term of such franchise maintain in full force and effect a single-limit comprehensive liability policy of insurance with limits of not less than three hundred fifty thousand dollars each occurrence and seven hundred thousand dollars aggregate, or such higher amounts as the council may fix in the ordinance granting the franchise or any amendment thereto, and of such insuring institutions, form and substance as shall be approved by the city attorney, and which shall assure grantee, and shall provide primary coverage for the city, its officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees against liability for loss or damage for personal injury, death and property damage occasioned by any activity or operation of grantee under such franchise, and which shall contain and include a standard cross-liability endorsement thereto.

(Ord. 67 § 8, 1981) 
5.16.080(A) - Franchise fee for state-issued cable or video franchise. 
    The city hereby requires a franchise fee of five percent of gross revenues generated within the city for any cable or video state franchise issues in its corporate boundaries by the State of Georgia.

5.16.090 - Construction and use of facilities. 
A.  Within thirty days after acceptance of any franchise, the grantee shall proceed with due diligence to obtain all necessary permits and authorizations which are required in the conduct of its business, including, but not limited to, any utility joint use attachment agreements, microwave carrier licenses, and any other permits, licenses and authorizations to be granted by duly constituted regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the operation of cable television systems, or associated microwave transmission facilities. In connection therewith, copies of all petitions, applications and communications submitted by the grantee to the federal communications commission, or any other federal or state regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction in respect to any matters affecting grantee's cable television operations, shall also be submitted simultaneously to the mayor. 
B.  Within ninety days after obtaining all necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, including right of access to poles and conduits, grantee shall commence construction and installation of the cable television system. 
C.  Within one hundred eighty days after the commencement of construction and installation of the system, grantee shall complete construction of the facilities needed to permit the reception of broadcast signals and the origination of programming within the franchise area. The grantee shall further complete construction of sufficient cable distribution plant within one year of the commencement date, and a like amount during each of the succeeding four-year periods thereafter, to make basic service available to an additional twenty percent of the franchise area during each such period; provided, however, that the council may approve exceptions to this standard upon a showing by the grantee of undue hardship or expense due to extensions of trunk lines of one mile or more to serve ten or fewer occupancies. Prior to commencement of construction of the distribution system, grantee shall submit a construction schedule and map to the city showing in detail the geographic location of the portion of the franchise area to be wired during each of the five construction periods, and shall construct the distribution system in accordance with such schedule as adopted or modified by the council. 
D.  Failure on the part of the grantee to commence and diligently pursue each of the foregoing requirements and to complete each of the matters set forth herein, shall be grounds for termination of such franchise. The ordinance granting the franchise shall contain a provision that by acceptance of the franchise, grantee agrees that failure to comply with any time requirements referred to in subsections A, B and C of this section will result in damage to the city and that it is and will be impracticable to determine the actual amount of such damage in the event of delay; and grantee therefore agrees that, in addition to any other damage suffered by city, he will pay to city the sum of one hundred dollars per day for each and every day's delay beyond the time prescribed, for completion of any of the acts required to be done by this section. 
E.  Grantee shall utilize existing poles, conduits and other facilities whenever possible, and shall not construct or install any new, different or additional poles, conduits or other facilities without first securing the written approval of the director provided that the privilege of grantee to construct, install or replace any poles, conduits or other facilities in, on, or over any street shall at all times be subject to the right of the city, in the exercise of its police power or pursuant to the terms hereof, upon reasonable notice to grantee, to require any such conduits or other facilities of grantee to be constructed, installed, placed or replaced beneath the surface of the streets; and any construction, installation, placement, replacement or changes which may be so required shall be made at the expense of grantee. 
F.  The city shall have the right, free of charge, to make additional use, for any public or municipal purpose, whether governmental or proprietary, of any poles, conduits or other facilities erected, controlled or maintained exclusively by or for grantee in any street or other public way or public place, provided such use by city does not interfere with the use by grantee. 
G.  Grantee shall at the expense of grantee, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, or temporarily relocate any property of grantee when, in the opinion of the director, the same is required by reason of freeway or street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, waterpipes, power lines, signal line, or movement of buildings. 
H.  In the event the use of any part of the system of grantee is disconnected for any reason for a continuous period of thirty days, without prior written notice to and approval by the mayor, or in the event any part of such system has been installed in any street or other area without complying with the requirements hereof, or in the event any franchise shall be terminated, canceled, or shall expire, grantee shall, at the option of the city, and at the expense of grantee and at no expense to the city, promptly remove from any street or other area all property of grantee, and grantee shall promptly restore the street or other area from which such property has been removed to such condition as the director shall approve; provided the city council may, upon written application therefor by grantee, approve the abandonment of any of such property in place by grantee and under such terms and conditions as the city council may prescribe; and upon abandonment of any such property in place, grantee shall cause to be executed, acknowledged and delivered to the city such instruments as the city's attorney shall prescribe and approve, conveying the ownership of such property to the city. 
I.  Upon the failure, refusal or neglect of grantee to cause any work or other act required by law or by this chapter to be completed in, on, over or under any street within any time prescribed therefor, or upon notice given, where notice is prescribed, the director may cause such work or other act to be completed in whole or in part, and upon so doing shall submit to grantee an itemized statement of the costs thereof, and grantee shall, within thirty days after receipt of such statement, pay unto the city the entire amount thereof. 
J.  Unless otherwise provided in any given instance, where any time is prescribed herein for the doing or causing to be done of any act, a city council for good cause, stated in writing, may extend any time for two additional periods of not to exceed ninety days each. Further, the running of any time period specified herein shall be automatically tolled whenever and so long as the certificate of compliance issued by the Federal Communications Commission to the grantee is the subject of a petition for stay, petition for review, or appeal filed with any United States court.

5.16.110 - Franchise limitations. 
    In addition to any other franchise limitations hereunder or as herein provided, the following limitations shall apply to any franchise granted or renewed by the council under this chapter: 
A.  Nature of Franchise. Such franchise shall be nonexclusive, and neither the granting thereof nor any of the provisions contained herein or in such franchise shall limit, abridge, diminish, alter or affect the right, privilege, power or authority of the city council; and the council reserves and preserves the right to grant any identical or similar or different franchise to any person, firm or corporation other than grantee, either within or within or partly within or partly without the franchise area of any grantee, subject only to the restriction provided in Section 5.16.040(A). No privilege or exemption shall be granted or conferred by any franchise granted hereunder except those specifically prescribed in this chapter. 
B.  Subordination of Franchise Privileges. The grant of any privilege by any franchise hereunder shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of any street or public property or to the grant of any privilege under any other franchise of prior date, insofar as there shall be any conflict. 
C.  Transfer of Franchise. 
1.  Any franchise granted hereunder shall be a privilege to be held in personal trust by the original grantee. It cannot in any event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, without prior consent of the city council and then only under such conditions as may therein be prescribed. Any such transfer or assignment shall be made only by an instrument in writing, such as a bill of sale, or similar document, a duly executed copy of which shall be filed in the office of the city clerk within thirty days after any such transfer or assignment. The consent of the council may not be unreasonably refused; provided, however, the proposed assignee must show financial responsibility as determined by the council and must agree to comply with all provisions of the franchise and of this chapter; and provided, further, that no such consent shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage or other hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, except that when such hypothecation shall exceed fifty percent of the market value of the property used by the franchise in the conduct of the cable television system, prior consent of the council shall be required for such a transfer. Such consent shall not be withheld unreasonably. 
2.  In the event that grantee is a corporation, prior approval of the city council, expressed by resolution, shall be required where there is an actual change in control or where ownership of more than fifty percent of the voting stock of grantee is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already own fifty percent or more of the voting stock, singly or collectively.

It shall be the duty of the pawnbroker to ensure compliance with the provisions of this section. 
B.  The following qualifications shall apply to all employees and managers: 
1.  No permit shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the police department, chief of police or his designee and a search of the criminal record of the person completed. Such application shall include the applicant's name, fingerprints, social security number, date of birth, and prior arrest record; though an applicant's arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only and shall not give rise to a presumption or inference of guilt.

3.  In the event the applicant is qualified for employment in a pawnshop under this section and there is no record of a violation of this chapter, the chief of police or his designee shall issue a permit to the applicant, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not qualified for a permit and therefore ineligible for employment in a pawnshop, the chief of police or his designee shall notify the person in writing that they are not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial and their right to appeal.

For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere entered under the Georgia First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq., shall be ignored. Provided, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender status or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender. 
5.  No person shall be issued a permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed, or misrepresented any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme while making application to the police department for a pawnshop permit under this section. 
6.  All permits and employee identification cards issued through administrative error may be revoked, terminated and seized by the chief of police or his designee.

8.  All permits issued hereunder remain the property of the police department, and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the police department or employee of the licensing and revenue department. 
9.  No pawnshop owner shall allow any employee or manager to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in their possession a current valid permit. For new employees, a receipt issued by the police department may be used for a maximum of thirty days from the date of issue. Pawnshop owners are required by this chapter to inspect and verify that each employee or manager has in their possession a valid current pawnshop permit. Issuance of this fee receipt shall allow the applicant to work in the position applied for only until such time as the required criminal history background investigation is completed. The temporary privilege conferred by issuance of this fee receipt shall expire immediately upon completion of such background investigation. If the background investigation indicates that the applicant does not meet the requirements for issuance of a pawnshop permit, the applicant may appeal the denial of the permit as provided in this chapter. However, issuance of this fee receipt and the temporary privilege granted thereby shall not be construed as conferring any right or privilege to the applicant to continue working in the position for which the permit sought during the pendency of the appeal from the denial of a permit under this chapter. 
10.  It shall be the duty of all persons holding a pawnshop occupation tax certificate to file with the chief of police or his designee, the name of the establishment, the occupation tax certificate number and a list of all employees, including their date of birth, social security number, home address and home telephone numbers twice annually; during the month of June and again during the month of December.

Chapter 5.40 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT 
Sections: 

5.40.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this section is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments. The city considered specific evidence of the undesirable secondary effects of sexually explicit businesses when it enacted the provisions of this chapter. Before adopting this provision, the city considered and reviewed an extensive report prepared by the city of Austin, Texas concerning adult-oriented businesses in that city and considered the increased criminal activity around the adult entertainment establishments and the expenditure of additional funds for law enforcement to combat the criminal activity. The city also reviewed studies prepared in Garden Grove, California; Seattle, Washington; and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. However, it is recognized that said regulation cannot amount to prohibition, otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this chapter represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods and property values through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. 
    It is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
    Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior in this section described. The mayor and council find it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the city as well. 
    Furthermore, it is the finding of the mayor and council that other forms of adult entertainment, including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and adult massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities. 
    The mayor and council find that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments upon the city are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities. In addition, the experiences of other cities and counties with adult bookstores have shown that a substantial amount of activity at the bookstore involves booths which an individual may enter, view videos depicting sexual activity, and sexually interact with a bookstore patron in an adjoining booth through a hole strategically placed in the wall of adjoining booths. 
    The mayor and council therefore find that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's day care facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the mayor and council find that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The mayor and council find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including, but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further find that such will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this chapter is adopted.

5.40.100 - Video stores. 
    Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Houston, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Dayton, Ohio; and Gwinnett County, Georgia, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the city, the mayor and council take note of the opportunity for unlawful sexual activities including, but not limited to, masturbation and oral and anal sex to occur at video stores which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films or videos depicting nudity, and for sexually transmitted diseases to spread as a result of the unhealthy conditions and unlawful activities associated with the booths, and the mayor and council further note that persons frequent the video booths for the purpose of engaging in sexual activities within the video viewing booths, and bodily fluids, including semen, urine and feces are found in the video viewing booths. 
    The mayor and council find that removal of doors on the video viewing booths and prohibiting holes between the booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in the booths. The mayor and council therefore find that it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the community to require that doors or other partitions on video viewing booths in video stores be removed and that no doors or holes be allowed to exist between or on adjoining booths. The mayor and council find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including, but not limited to, reducing unlawful sexual activities and unhealthy conditions in video viewing booths found in video stores. The mayor and council further find that these regulations will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To these ends, this chapter is adopted. 
    Any video store having available for customers, patrons, or members, any booth, room, or cubicle for the private viewing of any video or motion picture must comply with the following requirements: 
A.  Access. Each booth, room, or cubicle shall be totally accessible to and from aisles and public areas of the video store, and shall be unobstructed by any curtain, door, lock, or other control-type or view-obstructing devices or materials.

3.  All walls shall be solid and without openings, extended from the floor to a height of not less than six feet and be light colored, nonabsorbent, and smooth-textured; 
4.  The floor must be light colored, nonabsorbent, and smooth-textured; 
5.  The lighting level of each booth, room, or cubicle when not in use shall be a minimum of ten foot-candles at all times, as measured from the floor. 
C.  Occupants. Only one individual shall occupy a booth, room, or cubicle at any time. No occupant of same shall engage in any type of sexual activity, cause any bodily discharge or litter while in the booth, room, or cubicle.

This escrow shall be ten percent of that company's bonding capacity and shall not be less than twenty thousand.

Title 33 provisions, must be approved and be currently certified by the insurance commissioner of the state of Georgia, copy of such certificate to be provided with the application.

A.  Each bondsman must be licensed by the Georgia Department of Insurance. Any temporary status or licensing must be approved by the city attorney's office.

The initiative must be on the part of the inmate or public. 
C.  All bondsmen must sign the sign-in book when entering the jail for the purpose of doing business as a bondsman. 
D.  When called to come to the jail to write a bond, it is recommended that bondsmen call the jail and advise them they are coming, the name of the inmate and the ETA. This should preclude the problem of several bondsmen responding to the same call. The jail staff have been instructed to advise the second bondsman calling for the same inmate of the previous call, thereby eliminating unnecessary response to the jail. 
E.  All bondsman using insurance companies will provide a serialized power of attorney (POA) from the surety stating the limits of liability.

G.  No bondsman may pay a fee, come to any arrangement with, or give anything of value, directly or indirectly to any employee that works for the city without specific written permission of the mayor and council. 
H.  An insurer terminating the appointment of a bondsman shall file a written notice of termination with the chief. This notice shall state the reasons, if any, for termination. 
I.  Each bondsman shall charge a fee no more or less than that specified by the Georgia statutes. No professional bondsman his or her agents, or his or her employees who receive compensation for becoming the surety on a criminal bond shall thereafter receive any other sum in the case. If, before final disposition of the case, the surety surrenders the defendant who is the principal on the bond into the custody of the court, he or she must first return to the principal the compensation received for signing the bond as surety. 
J.  Professional bondsmen, their agents or employees, shall not advise defendant's principals in bonds signed by them, or give any directions in the defense or disposition of the cases in which bonds are signed. 
K.  When a FIFA is issued, the bonding companies will be given thirty days before levy process is implemented against escrow accounts. If, at the end of thirty days the FIFA has not been satisfied, bonding privileges will be suspended. Suspension of bonding privileges for this reason is administrative and not punitive. The state insurance commission will be notified for whatever actions it deems necessary, in the case of insurance companies. 
L.  Any violations of these procedures may result in the suspension of privileges pending an investigation of the violation. If, after an investigation the violation is substantiated, revocation of future privileges may result. If it is found that the violation did not occur as alleged or suspected, the suspension will be lifted. Any allegations of procedure violations must be submitted in writing to the chief of police for consideration. 
M.  A copy of these procedures will be incorporated into and maintained within the Detention Services Policy and Procedures Manual: 
1.  If a person has no other way to post bond and must hire a professional bondsman, it is his or her responsibility to choose a bonding company it is also his or her responsibility to contact the bonding company he or she has chosen. No employee is allowed to contact any bondsman or bonding company on behalf of anyone under arrest. Even if the person under arrest should request the employee to do so. 
2.  Under no circumstances is an employee allowed to recommend a bondsman or bonding company. 
3.  If a bondsman calls and wishes to be notified when a certain person is brought in, refuse the request. 
4.  No employee on duty, engaged in accepting bonds, should converse with a bondsman anymore than is necessary to complete the transaction at hand. 
5.  After signing the bond, the bondsman must leave the jail property unless the bondsman has legitimate business with someone else in the department who is not on duty to accept bonds. 
6.  No bondsman will be allowed to enter the book-in-area without specific approval of the shift supervisor or higher. 
7.  No bondsman will be allowed to view any records, receipts, or files unless they pertain to his or her immediate client and such information is deemed necessary by a shift supervisor or higher. 
8.  No bondsman will be allowed to leave business cards, memo pads, or other forms of advertisement around the jail. Bonding company signs will be rotated once a week in an orderly fashion. 
9.  No employee shall give special consideration to any one particular bonding company. An employee shall remain impartial at all times.

J.  A license application may be denied to any applicant for any alcoholic beverage license where it appears that the applicant would not have adequate financial participation in the proposed business to direct and manage its affairs, or where it appears that the application is intended to be a mere surrogate for a person or persons who would not otherwise qualify for a license for any reason whatsoever. 
K.  The city clerk, in his/her discretion, may consider any extenuating circumstances which may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, application or the proposed location of the business. If, in his/her judgment, circumstances are such that granting of the license would not be in the best interest of the general public, such circumstances may be grounds for denying the application.

Laws, page 324), as amended. Except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment, or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender. 
M.  The city clerk is hereby vested with the authority to approve or deny all applications requesting a license for the sale of alcoholic beverages within the city limits subject to and upon the terms and conditions provided in this chapter.

The city clerk, at his/her discretion, may waive or reduce the filing fee amount if it is determined the fee would create a hardship on the individual filing the appeal. The zoning board of appeals may, at the request of the appellant, refund the filing fee by a majority vote. 
C.  A hearing shall be conducted on each appeal within thirty days of the date of filing with the city clerk unless a continuance of such date is agreed to by the appellant and the city clerk. The appellant at the hearing shall have the right to be represented by an attorney, at the expense of the appellant, and to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. The appellant shall have the burden of proof on any such appeal. Before hearing an appeal, each member of the zoning board of appeals shall sign an affidavit to be part of the record that he/she is not related to any owner of the licensed establishment in question in the appeal being considered and that he/she has no financial interest in the outcome of the appeal. Should any member be unable to sign the affidavit, that member shall not serve on that appeal, and the case shall be heard by the remaining members of the zoning board of appeals.

The application shall include, but shall not be limited to, the name, date of birth, and prior arrest record of the person, though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only, and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt.

If there is no record of a violation of this chapter, the chief of police or his/her designee shall issue a permit to the person, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not eligible for employment, the chief of police or his/her designee shall notify the person, in writing, that they are not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial and their right to appeal. 
E.  No person shall be granted a pouring permit unless it appears to the satisfaction of the chief of police or his/her designee, that the person has not been convicted or pleaded guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal sale or possession of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexual-related crime within a period of five years of the date of conviction and has been released from parole or probation. A person's first time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a city or county ordinance shall not, by itself, make a person ineligible for an alcohol pouring permit. 
    No person shall be granted a pouring permit who has been convicted, pleaded guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any federal, state, or local law for any felony within five years of the date of conviction and has not been released from parole or probation prior to the filing for application for the permit. 
    For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which the defendant who was allowed to avail himself/herself of the Georgia First Offender Act (1968 Ga. Laws, p. 324) as amended.

F.  An alcohol pouring permit shall be issued for a period of one calendar year from the date of the original application. As noted in subsection K of this section, the alcohol pouring permit must be in the possession of the employee while the employee is working at the licensed establishment. This permit must be in the possession of the employee while the pouring permit holder is working and available for inspection by members of the police department or the city's staff. 
G.  No person shall be issued a permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed or covered up any material fact by any device, trick or scheme while making application to the police department for an alcoholic beverage pouring permit under this section. 
    If it is determined that a person is in violation of this subsection and a permit is denied for this reason, then thirty calendar days must elapse from the date of notification per certified mailing before a new application and fee may be resubmitted. 
H.  All permits issued through administrative error shall be terminated and seized by the chief of police or his/her designee, or the city clerk or his/her designee. 
I.  Replacement permits will be issued within thirty days of original date upon paying one-half of the fee charged for alcohol pouring permits. After thirty days of the original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted. 
J.  All permits issued under this chapter shall remain the property of the police department and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the police department or employee of the business license department. 
K.  No licensee shall allow any employee or manager required to hold a permit to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in their possession a current valid city pouring permit. For new employees, a receipt issued by the city police permit unit may be used for a maximum of thirty days from the date of issuance. Licensees are required by this chapter to inspect and verify that each employee required to do so has in their possession a valid current alcohol pouring permit. 
L.  It is the duty of all persons holding any license to sell alcoholic beverages to file with the chief of police, or his/her designee, the name of the establishment, the license number and a list of all employees, with their home addresses and home telephone numbers, twice annually during the month of June and again during the month of December.

B.  The requirement for approval is that the patio/open area be enclosed by some structure providing for public ingress/egress only through the main licensed premises. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink without the licensee's knowledge. 
C.  The height of the structure shall be a minimum of three and one-half feet above ground level.

With respect to this section, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such licensee could not have discovered or prevented such activity.

Where the remaining term of the license is less than twelve months, imposition of suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any renewal license.

(7)  The hearing officer's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested to the licensee and his attorney, with a copy to the city attorney, within ten business days of the close of the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer shall constitute final action by the city, subject to review upon petition for certiorari to the superior court.

13.04.010 - Meter readings-Billings-Collecting. 
A.  Bills to customers for water shall be mailed out on such day or days of each month as may be determined as desirable by the city. Bills shall be paid at city hall. A failure to receive bills or notices shall not prevent the city from demanding payment of same. The failure of water users to pay charges duly imposed may result in the imposition of the following penalties: 
1.  Nonpayment by the due date will subject the account to a penalty of ten percent of the delinquent amounts. 
2.  On the first day following the due date of an unpaid account, after posting payments received by mail or night deposit, late fees shall be assessed and written notice of such delinquency and assessment shall be mailed to the water customer or posted at the water service address. On the tenth day following the due date of an unpaid account, after posting payments received by mail or night deposit, water service will be cut off if the account remains unpaid. Notice will be given of the cut off and of the fees which will be charged in order to have service reconnected. 
3.  If water service is disconnected for nonpayment of an account, such service will only be restored after the unpaid bill(s) are paid in full, a security deposit, as may be required by the mayor and council, is made, and a service charge is paid for each meter to be reconnected. See Rate Schedule. 
4.  Should the water customer elect to pay the delinquent account on the date set for cutoff, a collection fee will be charged. See Rate Schedule. 
B.  The reconnection fee applies only to service which is reconnected during the hours of eight a.m. to five p.m., Monday through Friday. Should the reconnection be made outside these hours, the reconnection charge will be increased according to the Rate Schedule in this chapter. 
C.  Should any check written for the payment of a delinquent water account be returned to the city as "unpaid", "insufficient funds", "do not resubmit" or with any other markings indicating that the check will not be honored for the face amount, in addition to any applicable fees, fines or penalties, water service shall be disconnected without notice until all balances, penalties and reconnect fees due are paid in full. All further payments on said account must be made by cash or money order after the second occurrence of a check being returned. Payments by check will no longer be accepted on said account. 
(Ord. 252 § 2, 1998; Ord. 224 § 1, 2, 3, 1996; Ord. 177 § 1, 1994)

(Ord. 177 § 2, 1994) 
13.04.030 - Suspension of service.

A.  Upon discontinuance of service for nonpayment of bills, the security deposit, if applicable to the customer, as required by Section 13.04.100 of this chapter will be applied by the city of Auburn towards settlement of the account. Any balance will be refunded to the consumer; however, if the security deposit is insufficient to cover bills, the city may proceed to collect the balance due in the usual way provided for by law or in such other method as may be authorized by the city charter as now or hereafter amended, by state law or pursuant to ordinances adopted by the city. 
B.  The city reserves the right to discontinue its water service without notice for the following reasons: 
1.  To prevent fraud or abuse; 
2.  Because of a water customer's continued wilful disregard of rules and regulations affecting the city's water system; 
3.  To conduct emergency repairs; 
4.  Because of an insufficient water supply; 
5.  Because of legal processes; 
6.  At the direction of other governmental or public authorities;

8.  To prevent contamination of the public water system due to possible cross-connection when requested to do so by city personnel or when it is necessary to protect the water system or individual properties from cross-connection or backflow situations. 
(Ord. 177 § 3, 1994) 
13.04.040 - Complaints-Adjustment. 
    If a water customer believes his/her bill to be in error, he/she shall present his/her claim, in person, to the appropriate employees at city hall before the bill becomes delinquent. Such claim, if made after the bill has become delinquent shall not be effective in preventing discontinuance of service as heretofore provided. The water customer may pay such bill under protest and said payment shall not prejudice his/her claim that the charges contained on the bill are erroneous. 
A.  The city will make a special water meter reading at the request of a water customer for a fee of five dollars; provided, however, that if such special reading discloses that the meter was overread, no charge will be made. 
B.  Water meters will be tested at the request of a water customer upon payment to the city of the actual costs to make the test; provided, however, that if the meter is found to overregister beyond three percent of the correct volume, no charge will be made. 
C.  If the seal of meter is broken by other than the city's officials, employees or authorized representatives or if the meter fails to register correctly or is stopped for any cause, the consumer shall pay an amount estimated from the record of his/her previous bills and/or from other proper data. There is a one hundred dollar tampering fee for meters turned on after being turned off by the city for nonpayment, whether locked or unlocked.

    Water furnished by the city of Auburn shall be used for consumption by the water customer, members of his/her household and employees only. The water customer shall not sell water to any other person or permit any other person to use said water. Water shall not be used for irrigation, fire protection or other purposes except when water is available in sufficient quantity without interfering with the regular domestic consumption in the area served. Disregard of this rule shall be sufficient cause for a refusal and/or discontinuance of service. 
A.  Where a meter or a meter box is placed on the premises of a water customer, a suitable place shall be provided by the water customer, thereon, unobstructed and accessible at all times to authorized representatives of the city. 
B.  The water customer shall furnish and maintain a private cut-off valve on the customer's side of the meter. The water customer's piping and other required apparatus shall be installed and maintained by the water customer at the customer's expense, in a safe and efficient manner, and in compliance with the sanitary regulations of the State Health Department and applicable plumbing codes. 
C.  In order to be accepted as a water customer and entitled to receive water from the city's water system, all applicants, as provided in Section 13.04.100, must offer proof that any private wells located on their property are not physically connected to the lines of the city's water system and all applicants by becoming customers of the city's water system covenant and agree that so long as they continue to be customers of the city, they will not permit the connection of any private wells on their property to the city's water system.

13.04.060 - Reserved. 
13.04.070 - Charges constituting lien.

This statement shall contain a legal description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice that the city claims a lien for this amount as well as for all charges for water service subsequent to the period covered by the bill. 
(Ord. 224 § 4, 1996; Ord. 177 § 6b, 1994) 
13.04.080 - Foreclosure of lien. 
    Property subject to a lien for unpaid water bills, as provided for in Section 13.04.070, may be sold for nonpayment of same, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to pay the delinquent accounts, after deducting costs, as in the case of the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by the appropriate provision of the charter of the city of Auburn or under the authority of state law, and any action will be brought in the name of the city. This section does not obligate the city to pursue this avenue when collecting delinquent water accounts and thus the city may use any other appropriate legal measures to collect such delinquent accounts.

Chapter 13.34 - WATER SYSTEM BACKFLOW PREVENTION 

13.34.010 - Connection control and backflow prevention. 
1.  Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is: 
a.  To protect the public potable water supply of the city of Auburn from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within the consumer's internal distribution system(s) or the consumer's private water system(s) such contaminants or pollutants which could backflow into the public water systems; and, 
b.  To promote the elimination or control of existing cross connections, actual or potential, between the consumer's in-plant potable water system(s) and non-potable water system(s), plumbing fixtures and industrial piping systems; and, 
c.  To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection control that will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems. 
2.  Responsibility: The Georgia Rules for Safe Drinking Water (391-3-5.-13.2) require that a supplier of water or any person having possession or control of facilities, which may cause that contamination of a public water system, has the responsibility to prevent water from unapproved sources or any contaminants from entering the public water system. The director of utilities shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of said director of utilities, an approved backflow prevention assembly is required at the consumer's water service connection; or, within the consumer's private water system for the safety of the water system, the director of utilities or his designated agent shall give notice in writing to said consumer to install such an approved backflow prevention assembly(s) at a specific location(s) on his premises. The consumer shall immediately install such an approved backflow prevention assembly(s) at the consumer's own expense; and, failure, refusal, or inability on the part of the consumer to install, have tested and maintained said assembly(s), shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met. 
(Ord. No. 12-014, 7-5-12) 
13.34.020. - Definitions. 
1.  "Director of utilities." The director of utilities, in charge of the water department of the city of Auburn, is invested with the authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross connection control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

3.  "Auxiliary water supply." Any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public water supply will be considered as an auxiliary water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural source(s) such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, etc., or used waters or industrial fluids. These natural waters may by contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control. 
4.  "Backflow." The term "backflow" shall mean the undesirable reversal of flow of water or mixtures of water and other liquids, gases or other substances into the distribution pipes of the potable supply of water from any source or sources. See "backsiphonage" and "backpressure." 
5.  "Backpressure." The term "backpressure" shall mean any elevation of pressure in the downstream piping system (by pump, elevation of piping, or steam and/or air pressure) above the supply pressure at the point of consideration, which would cause, or tend to cause, a reversal of the normal direction of flow. 
6.  "Backsiphonage." The term "backsiphonage" shall mean a form of backflow due to a reduction in system pressure, which causes subatmospheric pressure to exist at a site in the water system. 
7.  "Backflow preventer." An assembly or means designed to prevent backflow. 
8.  "Air gap." The term "air gap" shall mean a physical separation between the free flowing discharge end of a potable water supply pipeline and an open or non-pressure receiving vessel. An "approved air gap" shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above the overflow rim of the vessel-in no case less than one inch (2.54 cm). 
9.  "Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly." The term "reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly" shall mean an assembly containing two independently acting approved check valves together with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent pressure differential relief valve located between the check valves and at the same time below the first check valve. The unit shall include properly located resilient seated test cocks and tightly closing resilient seated shutoff valves at each end of the assembly. This assembly is designed to protect against a non-health (i.e. pollutant) or a health hazard (i.e. contaminant). This assembly shall not be used for backflow protection of sewage or reclaimed water. 
10.  "Double check valve backflow prevention assembly." The term "double check valve backflow prevention assembly" shall mean an assembly composed of two independently acting, approved check valves, including tightly closing resilient seated shutoff valves attached at each end of the assembly and fitted with properly located resilient seated test cocks.

(Ord. No. 12-014, 7-5-12) 
13.34.030 - Water system. 
1.  The water system shall be considered as made up of two parts: The water purveyor's system and the consumer's system. Water purveyor's system shall consist of the source facilities and the distribution system; and shall include all those facilities of the water system under the complete control of the purveyor, up to the point where the consumer's system begins. 
2.  The source shall include all components of the facilities utilized in the production, treatment, storage, and delivery of water to the distribution system. 
3.  The distribution system shall include the network of pipes and conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the consumer's system. 
4.  The consumer's system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the water purveyor's distribution system, which are utilized in conveying potable water to points of use. 
(Ord. No. 12-014, 7-5-12) 
13.34.040 - Policy. 
1.  No water service connection to any premise shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by Georgia Environmental Protection Division laws and regulations, the State of Georgia Plumbing Code and this chapter for the control of backflow and cross connections. An approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on each service line to a consumer's water system and is to be located immediately downstream of the water meter or as close as physically feasible to the water meter. The type device is commensurate to the degree of hazard, which is determined by the director of utilities or his designee. Any installation other than that specified in this section shall be approved by the director of utilities or his designee. Service of water to any premise shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow prevention assembly required by this chapter for the control of backflow and cross connections is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. 
2.  The consumer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the city of Auburn water department to determine whether unprotected cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the director of utilities shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the consumer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with the State of Georgia statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. 
3.  An approved backflow prevention assembly shall also be installed on each service line to a consumer's water system immediately downstream of the water meter or as close as physically feasible to the water meter; but, in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist: 
a.  In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable as an additional source by the director of utilities, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
b.  In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line commensurate with the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the water purveyor's system which have been subject to deterioration in quality. 
c.  In the case of premises having (1) internal cross connections that cannot be permanently corrected or protected against, or (2) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line. 
4.  The type of protective assembly required under this chapter shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows: 
a.  In the case of any premise where there is an auxiliary water supply not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. 
b.  In the case of any premise where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve backflow prevention assembly. 
c.  In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants. 
d.  In the case of any premise where there are unprotected cross connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly at the service connection. 
e.  In the case of any premise where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in- plant cross connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly on each service to the premise. 
5.  Any backflow prevention assembly required herein shall be a make, model and size approved by the director of utilities. the term "approved backflow prevention assembly" shall mean an assembly that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works Association entitled: 
AWWA/ANSI C510-89 Standard for Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Assemblies; 
AWWA/ANSI C511-89 Standard for Reduced Pressure Principle Backflow Prevention Assemblies; 
and, have met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of the Foundation for Cross Connection Control and Hydraulic Research of the University of Southern California (USC FCCCHR) established in: Specifications of Backflow Prevention Assemblies-Section 10 of the most current edition of the Manual of Cross Connection Control. 
    The GA EPD and the city of Auburn have adopted said AWWA and USC FCCCHR standards and specification. A "certificate of approval" issued by an approved testing laboratory certifying full compliance with said AWWA standards and FCCCHR specifications shall evidence final approval. The following testing laboratory has been qualified by the GA EPD and the city of Auburn to test and approve backflow prevention assemblies: 
Foundation for Cross Connection Control and Hydraulic Research 
University of Southern California 
KAP-200 University Park MC-2531 
Los Angeles, California 90089-2531 
    Testing laboratories other than the laboratory listed will be added to an approved list as the GA EPD and the City of Auburn qualify them. Backflow preventers, which may be subjected to backpressure or back siphonage, that have been fully tested and have been granted a Certificate of Approval by said qualified laboratory and are listed on the laboratory's current list of approved backflow prevention assemblies may be used without further test or qualification. 
6.  It shall be the duty of the consumer at any premise where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have a field test performed by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation, after any repairs and at least once per year. In those instances where the director of utilities deems the hazard to be great enough he may require field tests at more frequent intervals. These tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by a certified tester listed on the city of Auburn certified backflow prevention testers list. It shall be the duty of the director of utilities or his designee to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the expense of the consumer whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. All repairs, overhauls or replacements shall be performed by a licensed plumber in the State of Georgia. Records of such tests, repairs and overhauls shall be kept and a copy shall be sent to the director of utilities or his designee. 
7.  All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies which do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved devices for the purposes described herein at the time of installation and which have been properly maintained, shall, except for the testing and maintenance requirements under subsection 3.103.6, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the director of utilities or his designee is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the water purveyor's system. Whenever the existing device is moved from the present location or requires more than the minimum maintenance or when the director of utilities finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section.

Chapter 15.24 - FLOOD HAZARD PROTECTION 
Sections: 
Article I. - Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Objectives 

15.24.010 - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the state of Georgia has in Chapter 35 of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the council of the city of Auburn does ordain as set out in this chapter. 
(Ord. 155 Art. 1 § A, 1992) 
15.24.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of Auburn are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses were caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other properties which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. 155 Art. 1 § B, 1992) 
15.24.030 - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. 155 Art. 1 § C, 1992) 
15.24.040 - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this chapter are: 
A.  To protect human life and health; 
B.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and bridges located in floodplains; 
F.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
G.  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. 155 Art. 1 § D, 1992) 
Article II. - Definitions 

15.24.050 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    "Addition (to an existing building)" means any walled or roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a fire wall. Any walled and roofed addition which is connected by a fire wall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls is new construction. 
    "Appeal" means a request for a review of the city's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    "Area of special flood hazard" is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year. 
    "Basement" means that portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    "Building" means any structure built for support, shelter or enclosure for any occupancy or storage. 
    "Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations. 
    "Elevated building" means a nonbasement building built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns (posts and piers), shear walls or breakaway walls. 
    "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
1.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and 
2.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    "Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)" means the official map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency where the areas of special flood hazard have been designated as Zone A. 
    "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means the official map of the community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the Risk Premium Zones applicable to the community. 
    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    "Floor" means the top surface of an enclosed area in a building (including basement), i.e., top of slab in concrete slab construction or top of wood flooring in wood frame construction. The term does not include the floor of a garage used solely for parking vehicles. 
    "Functionally dependent facility" means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales or service facilities. 
    "Manufactured homes" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for one hundred eighty consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
    "Mean sea level" means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
    "New construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
    "Start of construction" (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (PL 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank, or other manmade facilities or infrastructures. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either, (1) before the improvement or repair is started, or (2) if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either any project for improvement of a structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions.

(Ord. 237 § 1, 1997; Ord. 229 § 1 (part), 1997) 
15.28.040 - General requirements. 
    The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennae, governed by this chapter. 
A.  Building Codes-Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of communication towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. Tower owners shall conduct periodic inspections of communication towers at least once every three years to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the director. 
B.  Regulatory Compliance. 
1.  All towers and antennae must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communications towers and antennae. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the communications towers and antennae governed by this ordinance shall bring such communications towers and antennae into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. 
2.  Tower owners shall provide documentation showing that each communication tower is in compliance with all federal requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every twelve months. 
C.  Security. Communication towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, the director or the governing body may waive such requirements for alternative tower structures. 
D.  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the director may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
E.  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower. 
F.  Visual Impact. 
1.  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
2.  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
3.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
4.  Towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar height and design. 
5.  Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antenna, and shall be freestanding where the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower. 
G.  Landscaping. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and shall be as follows: 
1.  For towers one hundred fifty feet tall or less, a buffer area no less than six feet wide shall commence at the property line. 
2.  For towers more than one hundred fifty feet tall, a buffer area not less than ten feet wide shall be provided at the property line. 
3.  The buffer zone is to consist of materials of a variety which can be expected to grow to form a continuous hedge at least five feet in height within two years of planting. 
4.  Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed twenty feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or security facilities and staff/maintenance. 
5.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
6.  In lieu of these standards, the director may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening, including plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by the provisions above, except as lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal such as remote agricultural or rural locations or develop heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the director. 
H.  Maintenance Impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector and local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector street. 
I.  Principal, Accessory and Joint Uses. 
1.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless repairs to the tower are being made. 
2.  Towers may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. As long as all of the other siting, setback, separation and general requirements of this ordinance are met, towers may occupy a parcel meeting the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. The minimum distance between a tower and other principal use located on the same lot shall be for a monopole or lattice tower the greater of twenty percent of the tower height or twenty-five feet and for a guy tower the greater of one hundred breakpoint or twenty-five feet. This separation is required to assure compatibly of land uses and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site. 
3.  Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and dangerous chemicals. 
J.  Tower Lot Size, Setbacks and Separations. 
1.  The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate setback from the base of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or public street. Such setback shall be sufficient to: 
a.  Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as required in Sections 15.28.040(F) and (G); 
b.  Preserve the privacy of surrounding residential property; 
c.  Protect adjoining property from the potential impact of tower failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in Section 15.28.060. 
2.  A site is presumed to be of sufficient size when it: 
a.  Meets the requirements of the Section 15.28.040(J)(1) 
b.  Provides a setback equal to two times the height of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or public street; 
c.  Provides a setback equal to or exceeding the rear yard setback required for the adjoining property where the adjoining property is not in a residential district nor a public property or a public street; 
d.  Provides a setback equal to the height of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property or public street. 
3.  Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 
4.  For a guyed structure, the site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide a setback equal to at least the height of the tower from a guy anchor to any property line abutting a residential district, public property or public street in addition to the size required to comply with Section 15.28.040(J)(2). Such setback shall be adequate to provide a vegetative, topographic or other buffer sufficient to obscure view to the anchor from such adjoining properties. 
5.  All structures and uses associated with the transmission use other than the transmission tower shall be located to meet the setbacks required in the zoning district where the tower is to be located. To encourage and accommodate shared use of a tower, the director may waive or reduce setback requirements by up to fifty percent to accommodate the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment at a tower site. 
6.  No free-standing communication tower shall be allowed within a one thousand-foot radius of an existing tower within a residential area. 
7.  In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard of a residential district. 
8.  All free-standing towers constructed after January 1, 1997, shall conform to the following minimum tower separation requirements: 
Tower Height <50 feet 50-100 feet 101-150 feet >150 feet <50 feet 300' 500&prime 750&prime 1000&prime 50-100 feet 500&Prime 750&prime 1000&prime 1500&prime 101-150 feet 750&prime 1000&prime 1500&prime 2000&prime >150 feet 1000&prime 1500&prime 2000&prime 2500&prime  
    Towers and antennae mounted on rooftops or alternative tower structures shall be exempt from these minimum separation distances. 
(Ord. 236 § 1, 1997; Ord. 229 § 1 (part), 1997) 
15.28.050 - Shared use. 
    All new towers shall be designed to structurally accommodate the maximum number of additional uses technically practicable. 
A.  To encourage shared use of towers, no building permit or special use permit shall be required for the addition of antenna(e) to an existing tower so long as the height of the tower or structure on which the antennae is placed is not increased and the requirements of Sections 15.28.030(B) and 15.28.040 are met. 
B.  If a new tower is approved, the owner shall be required as conditions of approval, to: 
1.  Record the letter of intent required by Section 15.28.070(J) in Miscellaneous Deed Records of the Office of the County Clerk of the Superior Court where the tower site is located; 
2.  Respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request for information from a potential shared use applicant; 
3.  Negotiate in good faith for shared use by third parties; and 
4.  Allow shared use where the third party seeking such use agrees in writing to pay reasonable, pro rata charges for sharing, including all charges necessary to modify the tower and transmitters to accommodate shared use, but not total tower reconstruction, and to observe whatever technical requirements are necessary to allow shared use without creating interference. 
C.  Willful, knowing failure of an owner whose tower was approved after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, to comply with the requirements of Section 15.28.050(B)(1) through (4) shall be grounds for withholding approval of any application by such owner for a building permit or special use permit for any tower or antenna. 
D.  Such conditions shall run with the land and be binding on subsequent purchasers of the tower site. 
(Ord. 229 § 1 (part), 1997) 
15.28.060 - Special use permits. 
A.  A request for a special use permit shall be initiated by application to the director and handled in accordance with the special use permit provisions of Chapter 17.36. The mayor and council may issue a special use permit under this section provided it shall have determined that all of the general requirements of Section 17.36.030 have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties. 
B.  In granting a special use permitting the zoning appeals board may impose additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding property. 
(Ord. 229 § 1 (part), 1997) 
15.28.070 - Application procedures. 
    Application for a building permit for any communication tower or use of an alternative tower structure shall be made to the director. An application will not be considered until it is complete. A complete application must contain the following: 
A.  Inventory of Existing Sites. An inventory of the applicant's existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The director may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits under this ordinance or other organizations seeking to locate antennae within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; provided, however, that the director is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
B.  Site plan or plans to scale specifying the location of tower(s), guy anchors (if any), transmission building and/or other accessory uses, access, parking, fences, landscaped areas and adjacent land uses. 
C.  Landscape plan to scale indicating size, spacing and type of plantings required in Section 15.28.040(G). 
D.  Utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewage, drainage and power lines impacting the proposed tower sites. 
E.  An environmental impact statement fully describing the effects that the proposed tower and/or antenna will have on the environment and surrounding area including the radiological impact on human health, impacts on adjacent residential structures and districts, impacts on structures and sites of historic significance and impacts on streetscapes. 
F.  A certified statement prepared by an engineer licensed to practice in Georgia that the construction of the tower, including reception and transmission functions, will not interfere with the usual and customary transmission or reception of radio, television, etc., service enjoyed by adjacent properties. 
G.  A description of anticipated maintenance needs, including frequency of service, personnel needs, equipment needs, and traffic, noise or safety impacts of such maintenance. 
H.  Report from a professional structural engineer licensed in the state of Georgia, documenting the following: 
1.  Tower height and design, including technical, engineering, economic and other pertinent factors governing selection of the proposed design. A cross-section of the tower structure shall be included. 
2.  Total anticipated capacity of the structure, including number and types of antennae which can be accommodated. 
3.  Evidence of structural integrity of the tower structure. 
4.  Failure characteristics of the tower and demonstration that site and setbacks are of adequate size to contain debris. 
I.  Written statements from the FAA, FCC and any appropriate state review authority stating that the proposed tower complies with regulations administered by that agency or that the tower is exempt from those regulations. 
J.  Letter of intent to lease excess space on the tower structure and to lease additional excess land on the tower site when the share use potential of the tower is absorbed, if structurally and technically possible. 
K.  A reasonable pro rata charge may be made for shared use, consistent with an appropriate sharing of construction, financing and maintenance costs. Fees may also be charged for any structural or RF changes necessitated by such shared use. Such sharing shall be condition of approval if approval is granted. 
1.  The applicant shall describe what range of charges are reasonably expected to be assessed against shared users. 
2.  The applicant shall base charges on generally accepted accounting principles and shall explain the elements included in the charge. 
L.  The applicant shall quantify the additional tower capacity anticipated, including the approximate number and types of antennae. The applicant shall also describe any limitations on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses, e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, frequency or other characteristics. The applicant shall describe the technical options available to overcome those limitation and reasons why the technical options considered were not chosen to be incorporated. The director shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means. 
M.  Evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and of the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna. 
N.  Each applicant must make a good faith effort to substantially demonstrate that no existing or planned towers can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna/transmitter as described below. 
1.  The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned towers of a height roughly equal to or greater than the height of the tower proposed by the applicant. A list shall be provided of all owners contacted, the date of such contact, and the form and content of such contact. 
2.  Such contact shall be made in a timely manner; that is, sufficiently before the filing of an application for a building or special use permit to include a response into the application when filed. 
a.  Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be relevant if a timely, good faith effort was made to obtain one. However, where an existing or planned tower is known to have capacity for additional antennae of the sort proposed, based on the decision regarding such tower, that application for a new tower shall not be complete until the owner of the existing or planned tower responds. Such response is to be required as a condition of approval. 
b.  The director shall maintain and provide, on request, records of responses from each owner. 
c.  Once an owner demonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed by applicant cannot be accommodated on the owner's tower as described below, the owner need not be contacted by future applicants for antennae of the sort proposed. 
3.  The applicant shall request the following information from each owner contacted; 
a.  Identification of the site by location, tax lot number, existing uses, and tower height. 
b.  Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the antenna proposed by the applicant without requiring structural changes be made to the tower. To enable the owner to respond, the applicant shall provide each such owner with the height, length, weight, and other relevant data about the proposed antenna. 
c.  Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the proposed antenna if structural changes were made, not including totally rebuilding the tower. If so, the owner shall specify in general terms what structural changes would be required. 
d.  If structurally able, would shared use by such existing tower be precluded for reasons related to RF interference. If so, the owner shall describe in general terms what changes in either the existing or proposed antenna would be required to accommodate the proposed tower, if at all. 
e.  If shared use is possible, the fee an owner of an existing tower would charge for such shared use. 
4.  Shared use is not precluded simply because a reasonable fee for shared use is charged, or because of reasonable costs necessary to adapt the existing and proposed uses to a shared tower. The director and the governing body may consider expert testimony to determine whether the fee and costs and reasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable. 
O.  Any other information which may be requested by the director to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed tower and/or antenna. 
(Ord. 229 § 1 (part), 1997) 
15.28.080 - Appeals. 
    Appeals from any decision of the director shall be to the zoning appeals board pursuant to Chapter 17.48. Appeals from any decision of the zoning appeals board shall be made to the Superior Court within thirty days of the decision. Any decision on a request to build a tower or for a special use permit for a tower shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence in a written record. 
(Ord. 229 § 1 (part), 1997) 
15.28.090 - Removal of antennae and towers. 
    All towers and antennae shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such towers. If upon inspection by the director such tower is determined not to comply with the code standards or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower and the owner of the property if such owner is different, such owner shall have this days to bring such tower into compliance. In the event such tower or antenna is not brought in compliance within thirty days, the city may provide notice to the owners requiring the tower or antenna to be removed or declared a structural public nuisance as provided for in Chapter 8.32 and removed accordingly. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that communication towers and antenna not in compliance with code standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The city may seek to have the tower or antenna removed regardless of the owners' or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
(Ord. 229 § 1 (part), 1997) 
15.28.100 - Abandoned towers. 
A.  Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of the tower. The owner of an abandoned antenna or tower and the owner of the property where the tower is located shall be under a duty to remove such a tower or antenna. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within sixty days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the city may seek to have such tower or antenna declared a structural public nuisance as provided for in Chapter 8.32 and removed accordingly. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that abandoned communication towers and antenna are removed. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may seek to have the communication tower or antenna removed regardless of the owners' or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
B.  If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this ordinance as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna. 
(Ord. 229 § 1 (part), 1997) 
15.28.110 - Pre-existing towers-Nonconforming uses. 
A.  All communication towers operative on January 1, 1997, shall be allowed to continue there present usage as a non-conforming use and shall be treated as a non-conforming use in accordance with Section 17.1 6.010. Routine maintenance, including replacement with a new tower of like construction and height, shall be permitted on such existing towers. New construction other than routine maintenance on an existing communication tower shall comply with the requirements of this chapter. 
B.  A communication tower that has received city approval in the form of either a building permit or special use exception, but has not yet been constructed or placed in operation shall be considered an existing tower so long as such approval is current and not expired. 
(Ord. 229 § 1 (part), 1997) 
15.28.120 - Public property. 
    Antennae or towers located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the governing authority shall be exempt from the requirements of this ordinance, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the governing body.

Chapter 15.32 - WATER SUPPLY WATERSHED PROTECTION 
Sections: 

15.32.010 - Findings and purpose. 
A.  Findings of Fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Auburn, Georgia and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation which threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicant, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
B.  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city and surrounding communities; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This chapter shall apply to the portions of the following watershed(s), which occur within the jurisdiction of the city and are identified as water supply watersheds: Mulberry River watershed.

Chapter 15.35 - REGISTRATION AND MAINTENANCE OF FORECLOSED PROPERTIES 

15.35.010 - Findings and intent. 
    This chapter is adopted to address the interest of public safety. 
A.  The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure and vacant real property as a mechanism to protect property values in neighborhoods for all property owners. 
B.  Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted. 
C.  Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this chapter. 
D.  This foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners and agents to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of municipal code of the city of Auburn, Georgia.

A development permit shall be issued to authorize all activities associated with the land development process, including clearing and grubbing, grading and the construction of such improvements as streets, surface parking areas and drives, water and sewer systems, storm water drainage facilities, sidewalks or other structures permanently placed on or in the property except for buildings or other structures requiring the issuance of a building permit. 
2.  Development permit approval. A development permit (which may include grading, clearing, and grubbing) shall be issued at the developer's request following approval of a preliminary plat for a subdivision or a site plan for a non-subdivision project, along with approval of all other development plans and documents required to be submitted under Chapter 16.20 of these regulations. All plans approved for a development permit shall expire after twelve months if no permit is issued within said time period. 
3.  Expiration of development permits. A development permit shall expire twelve months after issuance unless development activity as authorized by the permit is initiated within the twelve-month period or if such authorized activities lapse and the project is abandoned for a period exceeding thirty calendar days. Provided, however, that the city may approve one extension not exceeding three months within which time development activity must commence or the permit shall expire. Said extension shall be applied for within the first twelve consecutive calendar months after the permit's issuance. 
4.  Lapse in construction activity. For the purposes of these regulations, a lapse in or suspension of development activity as authorized by a development permit, as a direct result of action or inaction on the part of the city completely beyond the control of the developer, shall not be considered as a lapse in activity causing the development permit to expire. The twelve months within which development activity must begin shall exclude any such time period during which the activity is prohibited or has been caused to lapse by said city action or inaction.

Chapter 16.36 - SITE GRADING, DRAINAGE SYSTEMS AND SOIL SEDIMENT CONTROL REQUIREMENTS 
Sections: 

16.36.010 - Site grading. 
A.  Grading shall be done in accordance with lines and grades shown on the approved grading plan. 
B.  Grading plans shall show existing and proposed contour lines at an interval of no more than two feet. Grading plans shall outline the areas which are required to remain undisturbed (i.e., tree protection areas, buffer, etc.) and shall indicate protective fencing or staking to be placed surrounding such areas. 
C.  Embankments shall be placed in uniform layers not to exceed a compacted thickness of six inches per layer and shall be compacted to a density of ninety-five percent of the maximum laboratory dry weight per cubic foot as determined by AASHTO Method T-99 in all areas where structure, parking lots and drives, streets, and utilities are to be placed. All other embankments are to be compacted to at least eighty-five percent. 
D.  The maximum slopes for cut or fill shall be 2:1 (two feet of horizontal run for each foot of rise or fall), except as discussed in Section 16.36.010(E). The depth of cut referred to herein shall be the maximum cut or fill occurring in any one section of cut or fill. The slope of cut or fill shall be uniform throughout for each section of cut or fill except when benching is approved by the city. When a cut is made in rock that requires blasting, the slope may be steeper if pre-splitting is employed and upon submission of a geotechnical report which substantiates the integrity of the rock in the steeper condition, subject to the review and approval of the city. (Note: No blasting shall occur without a valid permit issued by the state fire marshal office.) Refer to the standard plans for grading section and retaining wall details. 
E.  While most soils in the area can be safely stabilized at a 2:1 slope, some soils exhibit a low shearing resistance and a low cohesiveness. These soils typically are micaceous silts and sandy soils with little or no clay. If the 2:1 slope shows evidence of shearing, non-cohesiveness, sliding, or inability to maintain compaction, the slope shall be stabilized at 3:1 or by using such mechanical methods as needed (such as retaining walls or grow mats stapled in place) to maintain slope, height, and integrity. 
(Ord. 122-01 (part), 2001) 
16.36.020 - Stormwater detention. 
A.  Stormwater Management Report Required. 
1.  Every project shall provide a stormwater management report prepared by a professional engineer currently registered in the state of Georgia or a licensed professional authorized by state law to perform such a service. The purpose of this report shall be to formulate a plan to manage stormwater runoff so that stormwater runoff hazards are not created and existing runoff-related problems are not exacerbated, either upstream or downstream from or within the boundaries of the property being developed. 
2.  The stormwater management report shall identify the locations and quantities of stormwater runoff entering and exiting the site for both pre- and post-developed conditions. Analysis of the off-site properties shall anticipate future development in addition to addressing existing conditions. It shall contain drainage area delineation maps and other exhibits at satisfactory scale and sufficient in quantity and scope to define the boundaries of the site relative to water courses, drainage divides, drainage structures, and other pertinent features. 
3.  The analysis of downstream conditions in the report shall address each and every point or area along the project site's boundaries at which runoff will exit the property. The analysis shall focus on the portion of the drainageway immediately downstream from the project. This area shall generally extend a flow distance of about one-half mile from the project's boundary line, but shall be longer for projects contributing relatively large amounts of runoff to the study area, and shorter for small runoff contributions. In all cases, the most critical downstream area investigation shall be conducted relative to existing and anticipated land uses on tracts which adjoin the project site. 
B.  Stormwater Detention Required. 
1.  Whenever a stormwater management report indicates that adverse stormwater runoff related impact is expected to result from the development of a property, that project shall be required to provide stormwater detention facilities such that peak flows from the developed site do not exceed those associated with pre-development conditions. 
2.  The following criteria shall be evaluated by the licensed professional preparing the stormwater management report, and in determining whether or not detention should be required for any portion of any site: 
a.  Existing land uses downstream; 
b.  Anticipated future land uses downstream; 
c.  Magnitude of increase in peak flows due to development; 
d.  Presence of existing drainage problems; 
e.  Capacity of existing and anticipated drainage systems; 
f.  Creation of concentrated flows where none had occurred previously; 
g.  Availability of feasible locations for detention facilities; 
h.  Existing flows generated off-site which pass through project site; 
i.  The nature of the receiving watercourse. 
3.  Stormwater detention facilities shall be required for any portion of any site for which development activities will result in increased flows, unless the registered professional engineer currently registered in the state of Georgia certifies and provides certified documentation supporting the conclusion to the city that the following is true and correct as applicable: 
a.  The non-detained, post-development runoff will leave the project site as sheet flow, and will not have an adverse impact upon downstream properties. 
b.  The effect of detention would be to concentrate flows where sheet flow had occurred under pre-developed conditions, and any impact of increase sheet flows upon downstream properties would be less adverse than that which would result from the concentrated flows from a detention facility even if energy dissipation devices were employed. 
c.  The runoff will flow directly into a floodplain without crossing off-site properties, and the runoff will constitute less than five percent of the total runoff in the watercourse at the point where the watercourse crosses the project site's downstream property line. 
d.  The undetained flow will pass through downstream properties, in drainage easements obtained by the developer, to an existing detention facility which has been designed to manage the upstream property's runoff. 
4.  Should the professional engineer conclude that stormwater detention may not be necessary because of anticipated compliance with Section 16.36.020(B)(4)(e)(iii), rigid compliance with all of the following criteria is mandatory: 
a.  A stormwater management report shall always be required whether or not stormwater detention is required. 
b.  If the applicant proposes to show that the detention requirement may be eliminated for all or a portion of a project, then a pre-submittal conference with the city staff is required prior to preparation and submittal of construction plans for the project. 
c.  A studied FEMA floodplain or the one hundred year floodplain as determined by the consulting engineer must be present on the property of the proposed development in order for elimination of the detention requirement to be considered. 
d.  At the pre-submittal conference with the staff, the design consultant shall be prepared to discuss the downstream analysis findings as follows: 
i.  The affected stream must be analyzed for a distance of at least one-half mile from the downstream property line. The analysis must include all culverts, obstructions, existing and potential erosion problems, elevations of existing improvements, and any other existing modifications to natural conditions; 
ii.  If the existing downstream conditions are overburdened by the pre-developed flows in the stream, then detention shall be required unless the developer elects to eliminate the downstream overburdened conditions at his or her expense when the development occurs. 
e.  If the five percent rule is to be used to show that the detention requirements may be eliminated, the following must be included in the stormwater management report: 
i.  The five percent study point has to be at the downstream property line; and, 
ii.  The five percent study will compare peak flows originating on the site against peak flows for the ten, fifty, and one hundred-year flood frequencies of the major stream at the downstream property line; and, 
iii.  Comparison of peak flows shall disregard the timing of hydrographs. 
C.  Detention Design Criteria - General. 
1.  All stormwater detention design calculations shall be certified by a professional engineer or licensed professional currently registered in the state of Georgia. 
2.  All stormwater detention facilities shall be designed to control the peak flow rates associated with storms having two-year, ten-year, and twenty-five year return frequencies. Where conditions warrant, the one hundred-year storm shall also be regulated. 
3.  A variety of methods of achieving stormwater management goals shall be acceptable in providing detention facilities. The type of facility provided shall be based on the following criteria:

b.  The type of development which the detention facility is intended to protect; 
c.  Volume of stormwater to be stored; 
d.  Origin and magnitude of the flows to be managed; 
e.  Topographic opportunities and limitations; 
f.  Safety considerations; 
g.  Maintenance requirements; 
h.  Aesthetic considerations; 
i.  Likelihood of facility operation interfering with access to public or private facilities; 
j.  Proximity of facility to property lines, utilities, buffers, etc.; 
k.  Similar site-specific constraints. 
4.  Detention facilities may be of any of the following types, and two or more types may be used in combination with one another: 
a.  Normally-dry basins, whether excavated or created by damming a natural drainage feature, or a combination of both methods; 
b.  Lakes and ponds, whether excavated or created by damming a natural drainage feature, or a combination of both methods; 
c.  Parking lot facilities; 
d.  Underground facilities; 
e.  Roof top facilities. 
5.  Reservoir routing methods shall be used for all detention facility design. 
6.  The detention methodology used for any given project shall conform to the following table.

For purposes of this title, a detention facility shall be deemed to consist of the area within the maximum design ponding limits, the dam (if one) including all embankment slopes and wall footings (if applicable), primary and emergency outlet works, any drainage and access easements, and any energy dissipation devices. 
2.  Detention facilities, to the greatest extent feasible, shall be located so as to minimize the amount of flow generated on-site which by-passes the facility. 
3.  No portion of any detention facility shall disturb any required (as opposed to voluntary) buffer, landscape strip, or tree protection area, except that natural bottom detention ponds and their appurtenant structures, which require no grading and removal of trees, may encroach into a required buffer. 
4.  The one hundred-year ponding limits of a detention facility shall not encroach upon a public right-of-way.

G.  Detention Facility Construction Standards. 
1.  Stormwater detention facilities shall be constructed in accordance with plans reviewed and approved by the city, and shall be in place and inspected prior to the initiation of other improvements. If the detention facility is planned to be a lake, temporary detention facilities shall be provided and shall remain in 
place until such time as the lake has become effective in providing stormwater management. 
2.  Within a detention basin, all stumps are to be cut flush with the ground or removed and all debris is to be removed below the ten-year ponding elevation. Trees or shrubs may be allowed to remain below the ten-year ponding elevation only upon certification of the survivability of the vegetation. 
3.  Detention slopes which are disturbed are to be grassed. The ground cover within the basin shall be well established with all exposed areas covered prior to the end of the maintenance period.

(Ord. 05-001 § 3, 2005) 
16.38.040 - Requirements. 
A.  General Provisions. Discharges into the city's separate storm sewers that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. Nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city's separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial and institutional establishments. Impacts of such discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of land and water, and can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city's storm sewer system and proper management of post-development stormwater runoff. 
B.  Prohibitions. 
1.  Prohibition on Illicit Discharges. No person shall throw, drain, or otherwise discharge, cause, or allow others under its control to throw, drain, or otherwise discharge into the city's separate storm sewer system any pollutants or waters containing any pollutants, other than stormwater. 
2.  Prohibition on Illegal Connections. The construction, connection, use, maintenance or continued existence of any illegal connection to the city's separate storm sewer system is prohibited. 
a.  This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under any law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
b.  A person violates this chapter if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the city's separate storm sewer system, or allows such a connection to continue. 
c.  Improper connections in violation of this chapter must be disconnected and redirected, if necessary, to an approved on-site wastewater management system or the sanitary sewer system upon approval of the city of Auburn public works department. 
d.  Any drain or conveyance that has not been documented in plans, maps or equivalent, and which may be connected to the storm sewer system, shall be located by the owner or occupant of that property upon receipt of written notice of violation from the city of Auburn requiring that such locating be completed. The notice will specify a reasonable time period within which the location of the drain or conveyance is to be completed, that the drain or conveyance be identified as storm sewer, sanitary sewer or other, and that the outfall location or point of connection to the storm sewer system, sanitary sewer system or other discharge point be identified. Results of these investigations are to be documented and provided to the city of Auburn public works department. 
(Ord. 05-001 § 4, 2005) 
16.38.050 - Inspection and enforcement. 
    It is unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter.

B.  The owner or operator shall allow the city ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, photography, videotaping, examination and copying of any records that are required under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater. 
C.  The city shall have the right to set up on any property or facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of flow discharges. 
D.  The city may require the owner or operator to install monitoring equipment and perform monitoring as necessary, and make the monitoring data available to the city. This sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the owner or operator at his/her own expense. All devices used to measure flow and quality shall be maintained and calibrated by the owner or operator to ensure their accuracy. 
E.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the property or facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the owner or operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing the access shall be borne by the owner or operator. 
F.  In the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, the city is authorized to enter upon the subject private property, without giving prior notice, to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. 
G.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a facility for the purpose of such inspections is a violation of the provisions of this chapter. 
H.  If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the city is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of the provisions of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with the provisions of this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, environment and welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

A.  Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility, activity or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility, activity or operation has information of any known or suspected release of pollutants or nonstormwater discharges from that facility or operation which is resulting or may result in illicit discharges into stormwater, the city's separate storm sewer system, state waters, or waters of the U.S., said person shall forthwith take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of the release so as to minimize the effects of the discharge. 
B.  Said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile within twenty-four hours of discovery of the release or discharge of the nature, quality and time of occurrence of the discharge. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city within three business days of the phone, facsimile or in person notice. 
C.  If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of the establishment shall also make and retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. The records shall be retained for at least three years from the date of discovery of the release or discharge. Said person shall also take immediate steps to ensure that there is no recurrence of the discharge or spill. 
(Ord. 05-001 § 6, 2005)

(Ord. 05-001 § 9, 2005) 
Chapter 16.40 - PERFORMANCE GUIDELINES 
Sections: 

16.40.010 - General. 
A.  Purpose. The sections enumerated in this chapter are guidelines, and are intended to be benchmark indicators of what standards could be acceptable. They are further intended to allow alternate designs which could produce results similar to these performance standards and similar protection to the public. The objective of these performance standards is not to suggest a single methodological standard of acceptance exclusive of all others. Rather they establish what would otherwise be allowed in the absence of an acceptable alternative. 
B.  Constraints. The alternative design solutions are constrained by the design requirements of Chapter 16.24, the access requirements and Street and Right-of-Way Requirements and the street construction standards of Chapter 16.28, and the grading, detention, drainage requirements of Chapter 16.36, as well as the purpose and intent of these regulations. 
C.  Documentation Required. In the event that an alternative is suggested by the applicant, studies and reports conducted by professionals currently certified in the state of Georgia will be required to be submitted to and approved by the city. These studies and reports must clearly relate to the desired results and purposes expressed or implied in the applicable performance standard. Once an alternative has been approved by the city, it shall become a required standard applicable to the specific approved permit only. 
(Ord. 122-01 (part), 2001) 
16.40.020 - Lots. 
A.  Lots should be designed generally such that they are no more than four times as deep as they are wide at the building setback line, unless excepted by the city. 
1.  The city will require notation that a house location plan (HLP) is required to be approved prior to issuance of a building permit for all lots. 
2.  The city may require notation that a residential drainage plan (RDP) is required to be approved prior to issuance of a building permit on certain lots where additional (site specific) engineering will be necessary to properly grade the lot or locate the building or other improvements. Such lots include, but are not limited to: 
a.  A lot containing floodplain where fill or other encroachment into the floodplain is planned or reasonably expected; 
b.  A lot containing severe topographic features which interfere with the building site; 
c.  A lot containing a drainage easement with a pipe discharge or other facilities, or flow characteristics which may adversely affect the location of a building or other site improvements. 
3.  The city may require notation that a residential drainage study (RDS) is required to be approved prior to issuance of a building permit on certain lots where particular attention to site grading will be necessary, but formal engineering is not needed. Such an RDS is conducted in the field where the effect of the site grading must be accomplished with adequate care so as not to create a drainage problem on neighboring property. 
B.  Side lot lines generally should be at right angles (ninety degrees) to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines as much as practical. Side lot lines should be radial to the radius points of all cul-de-sacs. Variations of more than ten degrees shall require approval of the city, but shall be approved when appropriate to the reasonable loading pattern of the subdivision, efficient use of the land relative to topographic conditions, or provisions of improved building sites over those which would result without variation of the side lot lines. 
C.  Corner lots shall be sufficiently larger so that they have the same width between minimum side setback lines as an interior lot, but in no case shall more than seventy-five feet between side setback lines on a corner lot be required. 
(Ord. 122-01 (part), 2001) 
16.40.030 - Blocks. 
A.  The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with regard to: 
1.  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated; 
2.  Applicable zoning requirements as to lot size and dimensions; 
3.  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of street traffic; 
4.  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
B.  In blocks over one thousand feet long, the city may, when existing or proposed pedestrian circulation patterns or public gathering places so justify, require pedestrian ways or pedestrian access easements, as appropriate, through the block.

16.40.040 - Access. 
    A maximum number of two hundred residential dwelling units shall be allowed to be constructed with only one street outlet to an existing public street. If a second access to an existing public road is not available or, in the opinion of the city, could induce non-residential traffic through the development, a single entrance may be allowed if designed with a traffic signal and/or sufficient right-of-way and improvements to provide a protected left-turn lane.

A.  Street Grades and Design Speeds. 
1.  Minimum grade for all local and minor collector streets shall be one and one-half percent. Minimum grades for all major collector and arterial streets shall conform to Georgia DOT practice. 
2.  Minimum grade of less than one and one-half percent on a local street may be approved by the city, based on adequate engineering designs, where at least one and one-half percent cannot reasonably be achieved due to topographical limitations imposed by the land. In such cases, a record drawing and such computations as necessary shall be provided after construction to establish that the street will drain in accordance with Title 16.

B.  Maximum Grade. Street intersections should be designed with a flat grade wherever possible, but in no case should the grade exceed two percent in normal situations (or four percent in topographical hardship situations on local streets). 
C.  Intersection Approaches-Horizontal Alignment. 
1.  New local streets which approach an intersection with a street in a category higher than itself on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius less than two hundred forty feet shall provide a tangent section of roadway at least thirty feet long. Collectors approaching an intersection with an arterial on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius of less than five hundred fifty feet shall also provide the thirty foot tangent section.

2.  The minimum corner sight distance from the approaching street shall be equal to or exceed ten times the regulated speed of the intersecting street, as measured from the center of the approaching street in both directions along the right-of-way line of the intersecting street. As an alternative, the minimum corner sight distance requirement may be calculated using AASHTO "Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets," Chapter 9 (at-grade intersections), latest edition. The sight distance shall provide clear visibility of an object four feet above the intersecting street viewed from the centerline of the approaching street at the right-of-way line of the intersecting street, at a height of three and one-half feet above the ground. 
H.  Obstructing Visibility at Intersections. On any corner lot, within an area formed by the lot lines on the street sides of such lot and a line (miter) joining points on such lot lines located at a distance of twenty feet from the point of their intersection, the following shall apply:

16.40.070 - Driveway intersections. 
A.  Angle and Improvements. Driveways shall generally intersect streets at right angles. The portion of a driveway located within a public right-of-way shall be paved, if any. Driveways providing access to parking lots which contain six or more spaces shall be paved in accordance with the parking lot requirements of the zoning ordinance. 
B.  Driveway Design Standards. 
1.  Driveways serving single-family detached or duplex residences may be no less than ten feet wide at the right-of-way line and shall provide a radius to the back of curb or edge of pavement of the roadway of no less than five feet. All other driveway curb cuts on public streets shall conform to the standards shown on the driveway details contained in the Standard Drawings, by land use type as follows: 
a.  Driveway detail 1 (thirty-two foot width, twenty-five foot radius) for: 
i.  Service stations; 
ii.  Commercial sites (over eighty thousand square feet);

2.  All driveways and driveway curb cuts on state highways shall conform to Georgia DOT standards. 
C.  Auxiliary Lanes. Along any arterial, a deceleration lane, acceleration lane, larger turning radius, traffic islands, or other devices or designs may be required to avoid specific traffic hazards which would otherwise be created by the proposed driveway location. 
D.  Corner Sight Distance. All driveways approaching a minor collector, collector or arterial shall provide adequate corner sight distance. The minimum corner sight distance from the driveway shall be equal to or exceed ten times the regulated speed of the intersecting street, as measured from the center of the driveway in both directions along the right-of-way line of the intersecting street. As an alternative, the minimum corner sight distance requirement may be calculated using AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, (at-grade intersections), latest edition. The sight distance shall provide clear visibility of an object four feet above the intersecting street viewed from the centerline of the driveway at the right-of-way line of the intersecting street, at a height of three and one-half feet above the ground. 
E.  Separation, and Spacing. All driveways except those serving residential units on individual lots shall be recommended to meet the following criteria: 
1.  Minimum separation from a street intersection: one hundred feet from centerline of driveway to nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street, extended. For any driveway on a major arterial having a centerline between one hundred feet and two hundred feet from the intersecting street right-of-way line, access restriction may be imposed to avoid traffic hazards. Greater separation may be required for safe operation of a free-right lane, acceleration or deceleration lane, etc. 
2.  Minimum separation between driveways along the same side of a major arterial: one hundred feet between centerline as measured along the roadway edge or back of curb. 
3.  Whenever possible, proposed driveways along one side of a street shall coincide with existing or proposed driveways on the opposite side of such street. 
4.  Maximum number of driveways serving a single project: One for each four hundred feet of property frontage, or fraction thereof per street, along a major arterial. This is not meant to be a spacing standard but only an expression of the total number of driveways that are permitted serving a single project. 
(Ord. 122-01 (part), 2001) 
16.40.080 - Stormwater detention guideline. 
A.  General. 
1.  Stormwater detention facilities shall be designed so that their peak release rates, when combined with those of all detention bypass areas in the same basin, produce peak flowrates and flow velocities at the site's boundary line no greater than those which occurred at the same location for pre-developed conditions. 
2.  The positive effects of stormwater management via on-site detention facilities diminish rapidly as the distance downstream from the point of distance increases, and the smaller the facility's contribution is, as a percentage of the total runoff contributing to downstream flow, the shorter the distance downstream that the benefits are realized. Because of these limitations, on-site detention is effective at controlling flooding only when flow from the facility is a significant percentage of the total flow at the point of interest, and only if the point of interest is "immediately" downstream. The concepts of "immediately downstream" and "significant percentage of total flow are inseparable." 
    The portion of a receiving watercourse (one which receives and conveys runoff from a site) which lies within a flow distance of one-half mile (two thousand six hundred forty linear feet) downstream from the site, shall generally be considered to constitute that portion of the watercourse which is "immediately" downstream. However, the total flow in the receiving watercourse may become very large, relative to the flow contributed by the project site, within a much shorter distance For this reason, the "substantial percentage" test must also always be applied. For purposes of this title, the flow from a site represents a "significant percentage" of the total flow in a watercourse only when the ratio of the peak flow rate from the site to the peak flowrate in the watercourse (including the contribution from the project site) is greater than five percent. 
3.  Peak flow rate control shall normally be provided only for the two-year, ten-year, and twenty-five-year frequency storm events. However, under certain conditions, the one hundred-year event must also be detained to the pre-developed rate. Such control of the one hundred-year event shall be provided when failure to do so would result in flooding of other habitable dwellings, property damage, or public access and/or utility interruption. 
4.  For any stormwater analysis, the composite "C" (Rational Method) or CN (SCS Method) used for analysis of pre-development conditions shall not exceed 0.25 or sixty, respectively, unless prior approval has been obtained from the city. A pre-design conference between the design engineer and appropriate city personnel, which may in certain straightforward cases be conducted via the telephone, is required. 
5.  Rational Method runoff coefficients used for analysis of pre-and post-development conditions shall be consistent with those shown in Table 16.40.060.B. 
Table 16.40.060.B

B.  Dam Design and Construction Criteria. 
1.  Detention facilities which take the form of normally-dry basins, ponds, or lakes usually are created by damming a drainage way or watercourse. Such dams can take a variety of different forms, the most common being earthen embankments and reinforced concrete walls. Each type of dam has different characteristics, and the selection of the most appropriate type for a particular site should be made by a professional engineer and based on the physical features of the dam site, the purpose of the dam, the type of impoundment, safety and maintenance requirements. 
2.  For purposes of this title, dams will be addressed separately for each of the three most frequently encountered types of detention facilities: normally-dry basins, ponds and lakes. A normally-dry basin is one designed to impound stormwater runoff for only a brief period of time following a storm event. The vast majority of the time the basin will be completely dry except for any normal stream flows which pass through unimpeded. Lakes and ponds, on the other hand, are designed to impound a body of water at least several feet in depth on a more-or-less permanent basis. Lakes and ponds vary from one another only in terms of magnitude. The magnitude of a lake is determined primarily from the height of its dam, the size of its contributing drainage area, and the volume of water it is capable of impounding. For purposes of this title, a pond is any lake having a dam height of less than twenty feet, a drainage area of less than one hundred acres, and which is incapable of impounding more than ten acre-feet of water. 
3.  All dam design is to be certified by a professional engineer currently registered in the state of Georgia. 
4.  Dams for normally-dry detention basins shall conform to the following: 
a.  Dams for normally-dry detention basins may be constructed of earth, reinforced concrete, mortared rubble, or other suitable materials. 
b.  The design of any concrete or rubble wall over five feet in height shall be certified by a structural engineer currently registered as a professional engineer in the state of Georgia, and the structural design shall be based on soil tests certified by a geotechnical engineer currently registered as a professional engineer in the state of Georgia. 
c.  Any non-earthen structure shall be designed to prevent piping failure through its subgrade and abutments. 
d.  The construction of walls over five feet in height shall be monitored and approved by a qualified materials testing company. 
e.  Earthen dams for normally-dry detention basins shall have a top width of no less than eight feet, and slopes on both faces no steeper than two (horizontal) to one (vertical). 
f.  For earthen dams for normally-dry detention basins, there shall be at least one and one-half feet of vertical separation between the one hundred-year ponding elevation in the basin and the low point on the top of the dam. One foot of this distance is to provide a margin of safety against overtopping of the dam and the other six inches is to allow for settlement. No separation is required for a nonearthen dam, if it has been designed to overtop safely. 
g.  More stringent design and construction criteria shall be used for dams for normally-dry detention basins whenever the probable consequences of dam failure are severe. 
5.  Dams for ponds shall conform to the following: 
    Any engineer responsible for the design of a dam for a pond is expected to be knowledgeable of the criteria contained within the Georgia Safe Dams Act, Georgia Department of Natural Resources "Rules for Dam Safety" publication, and the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release No. 60 "Earth Dams and Reservoirs." The provisions of each are to be applied wherever applicable. Applicability shall be determined based upon site-specific constraints and downstream conditions. Consultation with appropriate city personnel both prior to and throughout the design process is encouraged. 
6.  Dams for lakes shall conform to the following: 
    Any engineer responsible for the design of a dam for a lake is expected to be thoroughly familiar with the criteria contained within the Georgia Safe Dams Act, Georgia Department of Natural Resources "Rules for Dam Safety" publication, and the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release No. 60 "Earth Dams and Reservoirs." All design is to be in accordance with the applicable requirements contained in each of the above referenced publications. 
C.  Detention Facility Outlet Devices. 
1.  Because of the variables that may be associated with the choice of an outlet device for any given condition, the design consultant is responsible for the selection of the device, subject to the review and approval of the city. 
2.  The city will include in its consideration the ease of maintenance, longevity of the system, freedom from congestion, practicality, and aesthetics in its review of the outlet device. The consultant should be guided by the preference of vertical weir designs since they have proven to generally meet most of the considerations expressed herein. 
3.  No orifice shall be smaller than three inches in diameter. An orifice smaller than fifteen inches in diameter shall be protected by a trash rack. A trash rack protecting an orifice shall have surface area of at least ten square feet. No opening in the trash rack shall have an area more than one-half the size of the area of the orifice being protected. Two-stage trash racks, or screens having progressively smaller openings placed in series, are suggested. To facilitate outlet operation, curved or inclined trash racks designed to allow debris to rise with the water level are preferred. In all cases, trash racks shall be either hinged or removable to facilitate maintenance operations. 
4.  If the primary detention facility outlet is a conduit through a dam, and there is not an orifice, weir-box, or other flow-control device affixed to the upstream end, then the conduit shall be analyzed for both inlet and outlet control conditions. If an orifice or weir-box is affixed, then the conduit shall be analyzed to determine if any flows will occur for which outlet control conditions of the conduit, rather than the hydraulic characteristics of the flow-control structure, will determine the total flows occurring. In any case where the conduit through the dam is less than fifteen inches in diameter, the trash rack provisions of Section 16.40.080(C)(3) shall be followed. 
5.  Unless the one hundred-year maximum flow velocity in a conduit through a dam forming a pond or a lake is less than ten feet per second, and the hydraulic grade line for the one hundred-year condition is at or below the crown of the conduit for at least ninety percent of its length, the conduit must be equal or superior to Class V reinforced concrete pipe in its structural characteristics. 
D.  Emergency Overflow Requirements. 
1.  For every type of detention facility, a planned safe flowpath must be provided for conveyance of flows of water in excess of those for which the detention facility was designed. In many instances, this function can be provided through installation of an emergency spillway. Emergency spillways are usually excavated open channels, either vegetated or paved with reinforced concrete. 
2.  Every earthen dam shall be provided with an open-channel emergency spillway, unless all of the following apply: 
a.  The principal spillway is a closed conduit having a cross-sectional area that can pass one hundred twenty-five percent of the one hundred-year storm routed peak discharge; 
b.  The principal spillway is a closed conduit having a cross-sectional area of at least one square foot per each three acres of drainage area, or a maximum of twenty square feet of surface area, whichever is less; 
c.  The inlet is a reinforced concrete box structure having an interior width equal to the width of the conduit; 
d.  The principal spillway capacity is at least equal to the capacity required for an open-channel emergency spillway. 
3.  Any portion of any emergency spillway excavated into a dam embankment or other fill section must be paved. Pavement material shall be either reinforced concrete or asphalt, as dictated by the design life of the dam and the potential consequences of its failure. Any portion of any emergency spillway excavated into natural ground shall be vegetated in accordance with the practices described in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
4.  In determining the necessary dimensions of an open-channel spillway for a normally-dry basin, a pond, or a lake, either the methodology contained in the "Earth Urgency Spillway Design Data" section of the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
e.  Emergency spillway capacity for earthen dams shall be as follows: 
a.  For normally-dry detention basins, ponds, and lakes, having a dam height of less than twenty feet, a drainage area of less than two hundred acres, and which are incapable of impounding more than fifty acre-feet of water, and for which the probable sequences of dam failure are not severe, the emergency spillway shall be placed at the twenty-five-year ponding elevation or higher. Its capacity shall be at least equal to the difference between the one hundred-year peak flow into the detention facility and the twenty-five-year peak release rate from the facility. 
b.  For normally-dry detention basins, pond, and lakes, which do not meet all of the magnitude limitations in Section 16.40.080(D)(5)(A), the emergency spillway shall be placed no lower than the one hundred-year ponding elevation, and its capacity shall be at least equal to the lesser of either the full one hundred-year peak flow rate into the facility, or the routed one-third PMF hydrography. In those cases where state or federal regulations may require greater spillway capacity, those more stringent regulations shall govern. 
6.  Emergency overflow for non-earthen dams may take the form of planned structure overtopping. In such cases, however, care must be taken to prevent flows from eroding supporting soils along the toe of or immediately downstream from the dam so as to cause it to be undermined. The profile of the top of the dam shall be so designed as to prevent flows along the ends of the structure which might result in abutment erosion. 
E.  Parking Lot Detention Facilities. 
1.  Parking lot detention facilities shall generally be of one of the two following types: 
a.  Depressed areas of pavement at drop inlet locations; 
b.  Ponding areas along sections of raised curbing. The curbing in these areas is usually higher than a standard curbed section. 
2.  Rational method shall be utilized for all parking lot detention facility design. 
3.  Parking lot detention areas shall be located so as to restrict ponding to areas other than parking spaces near buildings, and to not encroach upon entrance drives. 
4.  The maximum depth of detention ponding in a parking lot, except at a flow control structure, shall be six inches for a ten-year storm, and nine inches for a one hundred-year storm. The maximum depth of ponding at a flow control structure shall be twelve inches for a one hundred-year storm. 
5.  In truck parking areas, the maximum depth of ponding shall be twelve inches for the ten-year storm. 
6.  Detention ponding areas are to be drained within thirty minutes after the peak inflow occurs. 
7.  Parking lot detention areas shall have a minimum surface slope of one percent, and a maximum slope of five percent. 
F.  Underground and Rooftop Detention Facilities. The design of underground or rooftop detention facilities shall be in accordance with current engineering standard practice, and shall conform to the general spirit and intent of this chapter. In the case of rooftop detention, permissible structural loads and weatherproofing shall be governed by the standard building code. 
G.  Sediment Basins. 
1.  Stormwater management and sediment trapping functions should be separated whenever possible. Every erosion control design should seek to: first, prevent erosion from occurring; second, trap sediments as close to their sources as possible, and: third, provide a second-tier or backup line of defense against sediments leaving the project site. This backup defense will usually consist of check dams/and or sediment basins. 
2.  Whenever a sediment basin and a detention facility are both required on the same watercourse, the sediment basin should be located immediately upstream of the detention facility. 
3.  In unusual cases where a normally-dry detention basin is planned to be used to trap sediment as well as provide stormwater control, the basin may be undercut to accommodate the sediment so that the required detention characteristics, particularly volume, will be maintained. 
4.  The design of sediment basins shall be in accordance with Appendix C of the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
H.  Ponds and Lakes Not Used for Detention. In such cases where a pond or lake is provided as part of a development, but is not planned to function as a stormwater detention facility, the same general and specific criteria contained in this title shall apply, but may be modified in instances where a specific requirement is clearly detention oriented rather than safety-based. 
(Ord. 122-01 (part), 2001) 
16.40.090 - Culverts and pipe collection system guidelines. 
A.  Culverts. 
1.  Single barrel or single cell culvert structures are less prone to clogging and require less maintenance than multi-barrel or multi-cell installations and should therefore be used whenever feasible. 
2.  The maximum velocity in a culvert for the one hundred-year flow shall be fifteen fps (feet per second). Velocities over ten fps shall be considered a special design with particular attention required to pipe or structure invert protection and to fill slope, stream bed, and stream bank stability. 
3.  The minimum allowable slope shall be that which produces a two-year flow velocity of two and one-half fps. 
B.  Piped Collection Systems. 
1.  The maximum velocity in a piped system for the design flow shall be fifteen fps. Velocities over ten fps shall be considered a special design with particular attention required to pipe invert protection and the ability of the receiving waterway or detention facility to accept the flow without damage. 
2.  The minimum allowable slope shall be that which produces a two-year flow velocity of two and one-half fps. 
3.  The maximum allowable slope for a storm drainage pipe shall be twenty-five percent. Greater slopes may be approved if installation is in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. In cases where the slope is in excess of ten percent, anchor collars may be required. 
4.  A minimum pipe cover of two feet shall be required. 
C.  Outlet Location-Culverts and Pipe Systems. 
1.  Outlet structures (such as headwalls) shall not be located closer to the project site's property line with an adjoining property than a flow distance equal to six pipe diameters. For non-circular conduits, this distance shall be six times the rise dimension of the conduit. 
2.  The invert elevation of a culvert or pipe outlet shall be no more than two feet above the elevation of the bottom of the receiving watercourse at the outlet. 
D.  Energy Dissipation. The maximum developed condition flow velocity at the project site's downstream property line with an adjoining tract shall not exceed the maximum predeveloped condition velocity. Calculations may be required to support this velocity standard on a case-by-case basis. 
E.  Discharge of Concentrated Flows. 
a.  The discharge of concentrated flows of stormwater into public roadways shall be avoided. In no case shall such concentrated flows, including flows from swales, ditches, draws, driveways, or piped systems, exceed the allowable peak flow rates in Table 16.40.090.A. 
Table 16.40.090.A
Maximum Flows Into Streets Street Classification Allowable Peak Flowrate for a Two-Year Storm Local 2.0 cfs Major Collector 1.0 cfs Other 0.5 cfs  
2.  In residential subdivisions, the peak flow rate associated with a two-year storm shall not exceed 1.0 cubic feet per second (cfs) along any property line between lots within fifty feet of the building setback line for either lot, unless contained within a piped drainage system or maintained in a natural watercourse. This maximum flow rate may be increased to 1.5 cfs in individual cases where there can be determined to be more than the normal separation between the dwellings on the affected lots.

Chapter 16.43 - TREES AND LANDSCAPING 
Sections 

16.43.010 - Tree protection plan. 
    All utility installation, subdivisions, single- and two-family residential, multifamily, commercial, industrial and institutional developments shall be subject to the standards and procedures of this title. 
(Ord. No. 08-017, 8-7-08) 
16.43.011 - Intent. 
    The intent of this chapter is to promote preservation of trees during land development and on all property, public and private. Such preservation shall protect and enhance the city's greenery through tree protection and planting. Benefits include reduced soil erosion, stormwater management costs and flooding potential; moderation of microclimates; improved air and water quality; mitigation of noise and glare; energy conservation through reduced heating and cooling costs; and enhanced property values. These benefits are heightened by the scenic and psychological values associated with the tree canopy and are consistent with the city's emphasis on neighborhood quality and community revitalization. The further purpose of this article is to establish standards necessary to ensure that this objective will be reached and that the city will enjoy the benefits provided by an appropriate tree canopy. It is the objective of the city that there shall be no net loss of trees within the corporate boundaries of the city by creating a means to: 
A.  Provide standards for the preservation of trees as part of the land development process. 
B.  Prevent mass grading of land, both developed and undeveloped, without at least a minimum provision for protection and replacement of trees. 
C.  Protect trees during construction whenever possible in order to enhance the quality of life in the city. 
D.  Establish and maintain the maximum amount of tree cover on public and private property in the city by prohibiting destruction and removal of trees except in accordance with standards set forth as well as requiring the planting of trees on all development sites to achieve a specified minimum tree cover. 
E.  Maintain trees in the city in a healthy and nonhazardous condition through adoption and enforcement of professional arboricultural practices. 
F.  Establish, and revise as necessary, standards for planting and maintaining trees so as to improve the city's economic base by improving property values, to enhance the city's visual quality and its neighborhoods, and improve public health by reducing air pollution and the incidence of flooding. 
G.  Provide for the designation of specimen trees.

16.43.018 - Tree protection requirements. 
    Minimum Tree Density Standard Guidelines. The following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be retained for credit toward the minimum tree density standard: 
A.  Tree Protection Areas. Tree root systems are the most critical factor in tree preservation throughout the development process. The root system can easily extend beyond the drip line of the tree canopy (Figure 2). Disturbance of the root system can directly affect a tree's survival. The following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be retained for credit toward the minimum site density standard and to protect the critical root zones: 
1.  The root system within the drip line is generally considered to be the critical root zone. To protect these critical root zones, a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained; 
2.  The tree protection area shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree canopy as defined by the drip line of the tree or group of trees, collectively. In some instances, an area greater than the drip line area may be required to be designed as a tree protection area as determined by the city planner or designee; 
3.  Layout of the project site utility and grading plans shall avoid disturbance of tree protection areas. Whenever utilities must be installed within a tree protection area and such installation will encroach into the drip line of any tree to be saved, the utility shall be installed by tunneling at a minimum depth of thirty-six inches. Reasonable efforts shall be made to save as many trees as possible, including avoiding utility routing which would endanger the taproot of certain species; and 
4.  Construction site activities such as vehicle or equipment parking, materials storage, concrete washout, burn pit placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent damage to trees within tree protection areas. 
B.  Reserved. 
C.  Protective Barriers. 
1.  Prior to any land disturbance, all protective tree barriers shall be installed and maintained until completion of site landscaping. Authorization to remove protective barriers shall be in writing by the building inspector or by issuance of a final certificate of occupancy. Inspection of tree protection barriers is required prior to any land disturbance or development activity and the building inspector shall be contacted to schedule an inspection. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards are recommended for site entrances. 
2.  Tree fencing shall be a minimum four feet high, constructed in a post and rail configuration. A two-inch by four-inch wooden post and a double one-inch by four-inch rail, painted orange is recommended. Four-foot orange, polyethylene laminar safety fencing is also acceptable. 
3.  Where approved, other forms of tree protection may be utilized to delineate tree save areas, which are remote from areas of land disturbance. These areas must be completely surrounded with continuous rope of flagging (heavy mil. minimum four inches wide). 
4.  All tree protection areas must be protected from soil sedimentation intrusion through the use of silt fencing or other acceptable measures placed upslope from tree protection areas. No construction of any structure or improvement, or any construction activity, shall encroach or place solvents, materials, construction machinery or temporary soil deposits within six feet of the drip line, as defined herein, of any specimen tree or any tree within a tree protection zone. 
5.  All protective tree measures must be maintained throughout land disturbance and construction, and shall not be removed until final landscaping is installed. 
D.  Encroachment. Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss. If encroachment is anticipated within the critical root zones of exceptional trees, stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones, the following preventive measures shall be employed: 
1.  Clearing Activities. Roots often fuse and tangle among trees. Tree removal adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees. Where possible, it is advisable to cut minimum two-foot trenches (e.g., using a "ditch witch") along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut rather than tear roots. Trenching may be required for the protection of exceptional specimen trees. 
2.  Soil Compaction. No parking, material storage or traffic shall be permitted within the designated tree protective zones. 
3.  Utility Installation. The installation of utilities through a protective zone should occur by way of tunneling rather than trenching (Figure 3). 
4.  Grade Changes. A decrease in grade is best accomplished with the use of retaining walls or through terracing (Figure 5). 
5.  Removal and Replacement Due to Damage. Where the city planner or designee has determined that irreparable damage has occurred to trees within tree protective zones, the trees shall be removed and replaced. 
E.  Trees to be Retained. 
1.  Canopy trees with a drip line area within twenty feet of a proposed structure should be removed and replaced with an appropriate tree species. When such canopy trees are to be saved, special attention shall be given to protection of the drip line area. The state forestry commission should be contacted for technical assistance. 
2.  Where design constraints require placement of paved surfaces within ten feet of the drip line area of a canopy tree, such trees should be removed and replaced with an appropriate tree species. Alternately, the state forestry commission may be contacted to provide technical assistance concerning precautions that may be used to protect the tree and pavements. 
3.  All reasonable efforts shall be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable effort shall include, but not be limited to, alteration of building design; alternate location of building, parking area, water retention drainage pipes; or relocation of utilities. 
(Ord. No. 08-017, 8-7-08)

16.43.102 - Standards and revegetation. 
A.  Tree replacement plans should be prepared with appropriate consideration given to the function of trees in the landscape. Every effort should be made to maximize the environmental benefit of the plant material. 
B.  A tree replacement plan indicating the location of all trees proposed for re-vegetation is required. This plan may be included as part of the tree protection plan or may be submitted as a separate drawing. 
C.  The tree replacement plan shall include planting schedules with proposed tree names (botanical and common), quantity, size, spacing and any special planting notes. 
D.  Trees proposed for replanting must be on the tree species selection list found in subsection (z) of this section (appendix B [Section 16.43.117]), unless otherwise approved by the city planner or designee. Trees selected must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be in good vigor in order to ensure a reasonable expectation of survival. Standards for transplanting shall be consistent with those established in the International Society of Arboriculture publication, Tree and Shrub Planting Manual, or similar publication. 
E.  Spacing and the potential size of species chosen shall be compatible with spatial limitations of the site. 
F.  Replanted trees shall be ecologically compatible with the site and neighboring sites. Accordingly, the replanted trees shall be of the same or similar species as those removed whenever practical. 
G.  Trees must be replaced with at least sixty percent canopy tree species. 
H.  The tree must be compatible in extent of crown and root systems at maturity with nearby utilities. 
I.  Where trees must be added to achieve the one hundred-tree density units per acre, pines may not comprise more than fifty percent of the required units. Where existing pines already comprise more than fifty percent or more of the required units, no more pines may be credited toward the required units. 
J.  The use of flowering ornamental trees or plants classified as tree-form shrubs may be included in the tree replacement plan, but shall not be used for the purpose of fulfilling density requirements unless approved by the city planner or designee. 
K.  All replanted canopy trees shall be a minimum height of eight feet and a minimum trunk of two and one-half caliper inches. All replanted understory trees shall be a minimum height of six feet and a minimum trunk of one and one-half inches. The following minimum criteria must be observed in order to provide sufficient growing area for planted trees, unless otherwise approved by the city planner or designee: 
1.  For canopy trees, two hundred square feet of pervious root zone. 
2.  For understory trees, seventy-five square feet of pervious root zone. 
L.  Planting and staking details must be provided on the plan. 
M.  Trees must be relocated or replaced on site in accordance with the provisions of this action. 
(Ord. No. 08-017, 8-7-08) 
16.43.103 - Tree planting specifications. 
    Applicants for permits under this chapter shall submit tree planting specifications. Generally, these specifications shall conform to those established by the International Society of Arboriculture, as included in the Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual, latest edition, or similar publication. 
A.  Tree species selected for replacement plantings shall consist of an appropriate mix of tree species native to the region; 
B.  Trees shall not be planted within twenty feet of any structure or within fifteen feet of a paved driveway; 
C.  The National Arbor Day Foundation (NADF) recommends that conifers (evergreens) be planted closely together on the northwestern and northern perimeters of buildings to buffer structures from northern, winter winds; and 
D.  NADF also recommends that deciduous (broad leaf) canopy trees be planted along the southwestern and eastern perimeters of buildings to shade structures in the summer and allow sunlight to pass through in the winter. 
E.  Specimen trees are classified as any tree in fair or better condition as determined by the city planner or designee or state forestry commission which equals or exceeds the following diameter sizes: 
1.  Twenty-four-inch DBH: large hardwoods such as beech, oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, etc. 
2.  Twenty-eight-inch DBH: large softwoods such as cedars, pines, spruce, etc.; and 
3.  Eight-inch DBH: small species such as crab apples, dogwoods, red buds, sourwoods, etc. 
B.  Trees not fully conforming to these sizes may be considered specimen trees in the case of a rare or unusual species, of exceptional aesthetic or unique quality, or of historical significance. Such trees may also be considered specimen trees when specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a landscape design. 
Specimen trees are also characterized as any tree in fair or better condition meeting the following minimum standards: 
1.  A life expectancy of over fifteen years; 
2.  A structurally sound trunk, not hollow and having no extensive decay; not to exceed twenty percent radial dieback; 
3.  No more than one major or several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only); and 
4.  No major insect or pathological problem. 
C.  Specimen tree stands are a contiguous grouping of trees that have been determined to be of high value by the city planner or designee based on the following criteria: 
1.  A relatively mature, even-aged stand; 
2.  A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature; 
3.  A stand of historical or cultural significance; and 
4.  A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality. 
D.  In order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and incorporation of these trees into the project design, additional density credit will be given for successful preservation of specimen trees. Credit assigned for any specimen tree saved will be two times the density unit value shown in subsection (y) of this section (appendix A [Section 16.43.116]). Specimen trees shall be identified by the city planner or designee, and shall be located on the tree protection plan. 
(Ord. No. 08-017, 8-7-08) 
16.43.104 - Minimum site density standards. 
A.  A minimum site density of one hundred units per acre, exclusive of any acreage within a zoning buffer area and any trees needed to meet buffer requirements as set forth in this chapter or as conditions of zoning approval, must be maintained on all properties subject to this chapter. 
    The term "unit" is an expression of basal area, and is not synonymous with "tree." The density requirement must be met as a condition of the development permit issuance, whether or not a property contained trees prior to development. Trees, both existing and planted, shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site where feasible, with an emphasis on tree groupings to achieve aesthetic results in conformance with professional landscaping standards. Trees may be planted for credit within a public right-of-way, subject to approval by the city planner or designee. This density may be achieved through credits for preserving existing trees, by planting new trees according to the minimum standards of this article or through a combination of both. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all reasonable efforts must be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable efforts shall include, but not be limited to, alteration of building design; alternate location of building, parking area, water retention, or drainage pipes; or relocation of utilities. Minimum site density shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in appendix A [Section 16.43.116] of this article. 
    Property owners shall be subject to the minimum site density requirement set forth in this section. The density calculation shall be based on the net site area, excluding infrastructure improvements, such as roads, utility easements, detention ponds, etc. In no event, shall off-street parking areas be considered an infrastructure improvement. 
B.  Credit shall be given for existing trees to be retained which are a minimum diameter of three inches; credit shall be given for trees to be planted which are a minimum caliper of two and one-half caliper inches. Additional credits shall be granted under the following circumstances: 
1.  A total tree density credit, not to exceed twice the normal credit, may be granted by the city planner or designee for existing trees to be retained which have greater value as outstanding specimen trees, trees having historic value or being a rare or unique species; and 
2.  Existing trees to be retained within a 100-year floodplain shall be granted a bonus credit of fifty percent of the normal credit unless the trees are located within a required zoning buffer. 
C.  Trees replanted to achieve density requirements are to be species selected from the tree species selection list in appendix B [Section 16.43.117] or as otherwise approved by the city planner or designee. Replanting shall be at a minimum ratio of one canopy tree for every three understory trees. Minimum density may be met by planting all canopy trees, however, such density shall not be met by planting only understory trees. 
D.  In addition, no more than forty percent of any one genus may comprise the trees proposed in any replanting plan. 
E.  Minimum size requirements for replacement trees are contained in table 2 of appendix A [Section 16.43.116]. 
F.  Tree planting requirements may be amended by the city planner or designee in cases where minimum site densities are not evenly distributed on the net site area and aesthetic appearances are an issue. 
(Ord. No. 08-017, 8-7-08) 
16.43.105 - Tree survey inspection. 
    Following receipt of a complete tree removal application, development plan, or tree survey and supporting data, the city planner or designee shall conduct an inspection of the proposed development site within ten working days. The applicant shall be notified by telephone forty-eight hours in advance of the date and time of the inspection. Following the inspection, the city planner or designee shall advise the applicant of any recommended changes in the applicant's proposed tree removal, protection or replanting plans, consistent with the purposes of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 08-017, 8-7-08) 
16.43.106 - Alternative compliance to site standards. 
    The intent of this chapter is to ensure that minimum tree density is maintained on all developed sites. In limited cases, this intent cannot be realized, as a particular site will not bear the required density. 
A.  Two methods of alternate compliance may be acceptable, at the discretion of the city planner or designee: 
1.  Planting at a location other than the project site; or 
2.  Contributing to the city tree bank. 
B.  The following standards have been established for administering these alternative compliance methods: 
1.  The city planner or designee must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall one hundred percent of the required site density be met through alternative compliance. As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site proposed for development. No development permit shall be issued unless the city planner or designee has approved the request and received the necessary documentation and/or funds. 
2.  Whenever trees are to be planted at an alternate location, a tree replacement plan, meeting all applicable standards, must be reviewed and approved. The following note must be shown on the approved plan: 
A TREE REPLACEMENT PLAN ADDENDUM FOR THIS PROJECT SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO THE CITY PLANNER OR DESIGNEE FOR THE CITY OF AUBURN AT A MINIMUM OF 30 DAYS PRIOR TO REQUESTING A FORMAL INSPECTION. THIS PLAN SHALL INCLUDE THE SPECIES, SIZE AND LOCATION OF TREES TO BE PLANTED OFF-SITE TO CONFORM TO TREE DENSITY STANDARDS OF THIS ARTICLE. RELEASE OF THIS PROJECT IS SUBJECT TO APPROVAL OF THIS PLAN, AS WELL AS VERIFICATION OF THE INSTALLATION OF THE TREES. 
C.  The following conditions apply when a tree is to be removed under the provisions of this chapter: 
1.  The city may, with the consent of the property owner, relocate the tree at the city's expense to city-owned property for replanting, either for permanent use at the new location, or for future use on other city property; 
2.  Credit may be given to the property owner for each relocated tree as though the tree was proposed to remain on the property, provided the tree is relocated to a site designated by the city at the owner's expense. 
3.  As an alternate method of compliance, the city will accept monetary donations to the city tree bank. These donations will be used for the sole purpose of planting trees on public property within the city limits. Methods of calculating contributions to the city tree bank are contained in appendix C [Section 16.43.200] to this section. 
D.  The city tree bank will be administered by the city planner or designee. A quarterly report shall be submitted to the mayor and council indicating monies collected, funds expended, and the species, number, size and location of trees planted. 
(Ord. No. 08-017, 8-7-08) 
16.43.107 - Unacceptable tree species. 
    A tree species selection list providing recommended canopy and understory tree species for replanting is contained in appendix B [Section 16.43.117]. The city planner or designee shall review all landscape plans and tree protection plans to ensure tree species selected are appropriate, native species. The following species are considered inappropriate and shall not be used to comply with the requirements of this section: 
A.  Eastern White Pine; 
B.  Lombardy Poplar; 
C.  Mimosa; 
D.  Silver Maple; 
E.  Spruce; 
F.  Box Elder 
G.  Black Willow; 
H.  Royal Paulownia; and 
I.  Tree of Heaven. 
(Ord. No. 08-017, 8-7-08) 
16.43.108 - Planting and removal sequence. 
A.  All tree protection devices shall be installed prior to any clearing, grubbing or grading. The city engineer must inspect the installation of the protection and erosion and sedimentation control devices prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit or other development or construction permit. Tree protection must remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of development. 
B.  Tree removal shall be prohibited in the following circumstances: 
1.  When soil erosion or runoff problems will result due to topography, soil type, or proximity to floodplain areas; and the removal will substantially and adversely impact the existing soils relative to runoff and/or erosion. Information provided by the city engineer or other environmental specialist may be used by the city planner or designee in evaluating such impacts. 
2.  When specimen trees are located on site and cannot be adequately protected or replaced. Additionally, removal may be prohibited if reasonable accommodations can be made to alter the proposed project to save specimen trees and such accommodations have not been made. 
3.  The removal will have a significant, adverse impact on property values of any adjoining property. 
4.  Specimen trees removed with prior approval from the city planner or designee must be replaced in addition to the minimum site density factor to compensate for their removal. Specimen trees must be replaced on an inch-by-inch basis by species with the potential for comparable size and quality. For example, the removal of a thirty-inch DBH tree would require replacement of fifteen two-inch caliper trees of a comparable species. This tree replacement is in addition to the minimum site density. 
5.  Any specimen tree removed without the appropriate review and approval of the city planner or designee must be replaced by trees with a total density equal to twice the unit values of the tree removed. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is not evidence of its condition. 
6.  Removal of specimen trees ten inches DBH or greater shall be permitted only in conjunction with an approved preliminary tree protection plan, an approved grading plan, and an approved site development plan. 
7.  No person shall directly or indirectly remove or destroy any tree having a diameter of six inches or greater which is located on property subject to the provisions of this article without first obtaining a permit as provided herein. 
8.  Permits shall be obtained through application in a form prescribed by the city planner or designee. Each application shall include a written, signed statement citing the necessity for the removal or destruction of any tree, and the criteria set forth in subsection D. of this section that the applicant contends have been met. 
9.  Upon receipt of a complete application, the city planner or designee shall review said application pursuant to the requirements of this chapter. The city planner or designee shall either approve, deny or approve per conditions consistent with this section. An applicant may submit a new application at any time following denial of an application made pursuant to this section. All applications not acted upon within thirty days of the date of receipt of a complete application by the city planner or designee shall be deemed approved. An applicant may appeal the denial of a permit to the planning commission (serving as tree preservation commission). 
10.  No permit shall be issued for removal or destruction of any tree unless: 
(a)  A tree replacement plan meeting the requirements of subsection C. of this section has been approved; 
(b)  All other applicable requirements of this section are met; and 
(c)  One of the following conditions exists: 
(1)  The tree is located within the buildable area of the lot and the applicant has concurrently filed an application for a building permit to make improvements otherwise permissible under all applicable ordinances of the city. 
(2)  The tree is diseased or injured to the extent that death is imminent within two years, is in imminent danger of falling, is so close to existing or proposed structures as to endanger them, physically interferes with utility services in a manner that cannot be corrected by anything less than destruction or removal of the tree, or creates a hazardous traffic condition. 
11.  Each applicant shall, to the maximum extent feasible, minimize the removal of trees from the site. In any request for a permit for tree removal in which the resulting tree density present on the site will be less than one hundred density units per acre, the city planner or designee shall require replacement such that the average number of trees on the site is equal to not less than one hundred caliper inches per acre. Where tree removal is unavoidable, trees replanted shall be an appropriate species mix considered native to the region. 
12.  It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person to top any tree. Topping is defined as the severe pruning of limbs to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from this provision of this chapter at the determination of the city planner or designee. 
(Ord. No. 08-017, 8-7-08) 
16.43.109 - Exemptions. 
    This section shall not apply to so-called "grandfathered" projects, that is, any portion of a property included within the limits of a valid land disturbance permit issued prior to the effective date of this article, provided that all time constraints relating to the permit issued shall be observed. In no event shall any grandfathered project be extended for a time period greater than twelve months from the date of enactment of this chapter. 
A.  The county extension service, state forestry commission, a certified arborist or registered forester shall examine trees believed to be dead, diseased, structurally unsound or infested which constitute a danger to human life or property and submit a report of their findings prior to their removal. 
B.  No more than five non-specimen trees totaling twenty-four inches DBH or less may be removed from an owner-occupied, single-family lot of less than two acres within a single calendar year. 
C.  Provisions of this section only in relation to those trees which are planted and are being grown for sale or intended sale to the general public in the ordinary course of business. 
D.  Removal of trees from horticultural properties such as farms, nurseries or orchards. 
E.  Necessary removal of trees by a utility company within dedicated utility easements. 
F.  Removal of trees on public rights-of-way conducted by, on behalf of, or for any activity to be dedicated to a federal, state, county, municipal or other government agency in pursuit of its lawful activities or function in the construction or improvement of public rights-of-way, including public streets, drainage and utilities. 
G.  Removal of trees, other than specimen trees, from detention ponds and drainage easements. 
H.  Activities which require issuance of a building permit but do not require or authorize land disturbance. 
I.  None of the above exemptions shall be interpreted to include tree removal or timber harvesting incidental to development of the land. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all reasonable efforts shall be made to save specimen trees. 
(Ord. No. 08-017, 8-17-08) 
16.43.110 - Land disturbance and building construction permits. 
A.  Compliance With Site Density Factor. When seeking a limited land disturbance permit (i.e., clearing, clearing and grading, or grading only), it is necessary for applicants to show compliance with the required site density factor. Trees existing on site should be used to meet the required tree density. Tree removal and replacement shall be subject to city planner or designee approval. A replacement tree plan must be a part of the approved clearing and/or grading plan. 
B.  Phased Projects and Reduced Net Site Areas. Where development is scheduled to occur in phases, density calculations must be based on the site area defined by an established phase line. Similarly, a reduced net site area may be achieved by using only the area of actual site disturbance, provided that a limit of construction line is clearly shown on the plan. 
C.  Criteria. In the instances of section 16.43.012, the following criteria are applied regarding existing trees: 
1.  Existing trees to be counted toward meeting the density requirements should be within the phase line or limits of construction; 
2.  If the tree save areas must be established outside these areas, they must be located where future development will not impact them; and 
3.  Trees located in such saved areas outside the phase line or limits of construction may not be counted toward the density requirement of subsequent phases or new projects. 
(Ord. No. 08-017, 8-7-08) 
16.43.111 - Tree removal by utility and construction companies. 
    All provisions of this section shall apply to any person removing trees on behalf of any other person, including all tree removal companies, utility companies or persons in the business of removing trees or construction. 
A.  It shall be unlawful for any person or company to remove or cause to be removed any tree, or undertake any work for which a development permit is required pursuant to this section, unless a valid permit thereof is in effect and displayed according to subsection 16.43.113(j). If any such work or removal is performed without the permit being displayed as required, such removal or work shall constitute a violation of this article and shall subject the person or company violating this section to all penalties provided herein. 
B.  Utility companies may provide emergency work without formal approval; provided, however, that such emergency work is reported in writing to the city planner or designee within three business days following completion of all emergency work. Further, the permit taken by any person, company or utility under this section shall include defined areas of tree cutting and trimming under a single permit. 
C.  All tree removal companies, utility companies or persons in the business of removing trees or construction shall remove from the site any trees, stumps, limbs or debris caused by activities allowed by the issuance of a permit under this chapter. 
D.  All utility companies shall be required to obtain an annual permit issued by the city planner or designee. All applications for an annual permit shall include a list of subcontractors with names, addresses, telephone numbers and city business license numbers. Periodic work schedules are to be submitted to the city planner or designee showing the proposed location and extent of tree work to be performed. 
E.  All tree trimming and pruning to be performed by public utilities, public agencies, and their subcontractors on trees growing on private or public rights-of-way shall be done according to the National Arborist Association Standards for Pruning of Shade Trees. 
G.  The routing of all public and private utility easements shall be subject to review and comment by the city planner or designee. 
(Ord. No. 08-017, 8-7-08) 
16.43.112 - Debris disposal requirements. 
    Any land disturbing activity, including clearing, grading or logging, all biodegradable debris, including but not limited to tree stumps, trunks, limbs or brush, shall be hauled off-site to an appropriate disposal location. All debris from trees cut shall be removed from the site in a timely manner, including the removal of any portion of the tree stump above the original natural grade, unless excepted by the city planner or designee for a specific reason such as, but not limited to, unusually large size or access considerations. Under no circumstances shall such materials be stored or buried on-site. 
(Ord. No. 08-017, 8-7-08) 
16.43.113 - Enforcement. 
    The city's code enforcement officer or city planner shall enforce this section, and may withhold issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or permits and inspections, for any development as required until the provisions of this chapter have been fully met. For purposes of enforcement of this section, the city planner or code enforcement officer is hereby clothed with police power to perform all acts necessary to ensure that the provisions of this section are not violated, including, but not limited to, the issuance of citations for violation of any provision of this section. 
A.  Preconstruction Inspection. Prior to or concurrent with the issuance of a permit for clearing, grubbing and grading, site development or road construction, the city planner or designee must inspect all tree protection devices for compliance with the approval plans. Failure to adhere to the standards set forth in this section will constitute noncompliance and will subject the project to enforcement procedures found in this subsection. 
B.  Construction Inspection. During construction, the city planner or designee will periodically inspect all projects to assure the adequacy of tree protection fencing. Failure to adhere to the city's standards for tree protection will constitute ordinance noncompliance and will subject the project to enforcement procedures found in this subsection. 
C.  Final Inspection. Prior to the release of the project for final platting or certificate of occupancy, or other form of the city's acceptance, the city's city planner or designee shall inspect for compliance with all the requirements of this section. Any disturbances in tree save areas or deficiencies in the required site density factor (SDF) will be cited at this time. Tree save area disturbances and/or SDF deficiencies must be corrected with new tree plantings prior to project release. Existing trees which are not expected to survive will not be counted toward meeting density requirements. Conversely, any existing trees not shown to remain on plans but which have been preserved, utilizing all tree preservation standards through field adjustments to the project may be counted toward density requirements, provided that all changes are recorded on the city's file plans. 
D.  Maintenance Inspection. One full growing season after the date of the inspection of new tree installations, the city planner or designee will inspect all trees on the project site. Any trees planted to meet the required site density factor which are dead or near death must be replaced. Trees preserved to meet the required site density, which are dead or near death at the time of the maintenance inspection, must be replaced if there is evidence that the demise of such trees was due to construction injury. Project owners at the time of the maintenance inspection are responsible for compliance to this chapter. Trees which are used to meet the density requirements in this section shall be maintained for two years after the date of final inspection. The property owner shall maintain the required tree density. The developer or builder will be responsible for identifying newly planted trees to the homeowner and to inform the homeowner as to their proper maintenance. Any trees to be replaced by this inspection must be planted within thirty days of receipt of notification by the current owner. New tree plantings may be postponed for up to six months by posting a performance bond in the amount of one hundred ten percent of the planting cost. Failure to plant new trees in accordance with these provisions will constitute ordinance noncompliance, and will subject the project to possible civil penalties found in the city's tree preservation ordinance. 
E.  Issuance of Certificate of Occupancy. 
1.  All trees used to fulfill the site density standard shall be planted prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy (CO). 
2.  Upon final installation of new trees planted under the requirements of this section, and following acceptance by the city planner or designee, the owner shall warrant the new trees and provide for replacement of those that do not survive for a minimum two-year period. 
3.  In the event that new trees proposed to be planted to achieve the site density standard are not installed upon application for a CO or final plat approval, as appropriate, a performance bond or other acceptable surety in an amount equal to one hundred ten percent of the value of the new trees and their installation shall be posted in accordance with performance bonding requirements. The term of the bond shall not exceed one year. 
4.  An inspection of all tree plantings shall be made by the city engineer to assure compliance with plan requirements prior to release of the performance bond. The bond will be drawn upon by the city at the time of expiration if the planting requirements have not been fulfilled, or if the owner has not requested an extension. One six-month extension is permitted with documented justification. Any inspections performed after the final inspection (for project release) are subject to re-inspection fee schedules. 
F.  Restoration of Disturbed Tree Save Areas. Once a tree save area has been established through the city planner or designee plan approval process, any destruction of trees in that area must be mitigated by planting new trees to restore the required site density or to achieve the intended effect of the buffer as appropriate. 
G.  Remedial Care. Trees in the tree save areas which have been adversely impacted by the construction process may be subject to remedial care. Remedial care will be performed at the discretion of city engineer and may include, but not limited to, the following: 
1.  Pruning; 
2.  Soil aeration; 
3.  Fertilization; and 
4.  Supplemental watering. 
H.  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by a decision of the city planner in the enforcement or interpretation of any of the terms or provisions of this section may appeal the decision to the planning commission. Such appeal shall be made by filing written notice thereof with the city planner within ten business days following the decision being appealed. 
I.  Administrative Variances. Front, side and rear yard setbacks may be reduced by an amount not to exceed fifty percent where it is determined by the city planner or designee to be necessary in order to preserve existing specimen or significant trees. Appropriate conditions to said administrative variances shall be imposed so as to ensure the continued health of said trees following the granting of such variances, including mandatory replacement requirements. Such administrative variances shall be considered and decided consistent with the procedures and criteria contained in this section. Appeals of final decisions regarding administrative variances may be made to the zoning board of appeals. 
J.  Display of Permit and Inspections. The applicant shall prominently display the permit in a conspicuous location on the job site. Such permit shall be displayed continuously while trees are being removed or replaced or work done as authorized on the permit. As a condition for issuance of a permit, the applicant shall agree in writing to entry onto their premises by representatives of the city as designated by the city planner or designee to inspect the permit and activities at any time, and such entry shall be lawful. Failure to allow such entry shall be unlawful and shall constitute a violation of this chapter. 
K.  Stop Work Orders. Upon notice from the issuing authority, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this section shall be immediately stopped. Such notice shall be in writing; shall state the specific violations; shall be given to the applicant, his authorized agent, or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the subject property; and shall state the conditions under which work may resume. Where an emergency exists, no written notice shall be required. 
L.  Emergencies. During the period of any emergency, such as a hurricane, windstorm, ice storm, flood or other disaster, the requirements of this section may be waived by the mayor, or other designated official, upon a finding that such waiver is necessary so that public and/or private work to restore order in the city will not be impeded. 
(Ord. No. 08-017, 8-7-08) 
16.43.114 - Fees. 
    Each applicant requesting a permit under the provisions of this section shall deposit with the city a fee of two hundred dollars, which shall be nonrefundable. Provided, however, no fee shall be charged on any application filed solely for work within a public right-of-way. Provided, further, that no fee shall be charged on any application where the city planner determines that the trees meet the exception/exemption criteria contained in section 16.43.109. 
(Ord. No. 08-017, 8-7-08) 
16.43.115 - Violations and penalty. 
    Any person, firm or corporation violating a provision of this section shall be deemed guilty of violating a duly adopted ordinance of the city and, upon conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction, may be punished as provided in the City Code, as amended, and in addition thereto may be enjoined from continuing the violation. 
    The court shall have the power and authority to place any person found guilty of a violation of this section on probation, and to suspend or modify any fine or sentence. As a condition of said suspension, the court may require payment of restitution or impose other punishment allowed by law which may include mandatory attendance at an educational program concerning tree preservation. Each day's continuance of a violation may be considered a separate offense. Each tree cut, damaged or poisoned shall constitute a separate offense. 
    The owner of any property wherein a violation exists, and any architect, developer, builder, contractor, tenant or agents who commits or may have assisted in the commission of any such violation, shall be guilty of a separate offense.

16.43.116 - Density factor. 
    All properties subject to this article must maintain a minimum tree density of one hundred units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area, and is not synonymous with "tree." The density requirement must be met as a condition of development permit issuance, whether or not a property contained trees prior to development. This density may be achieved through credits for preserving existing trees, by planting new trees according to the minimum standards of this section or through a combination of both. 
A.  The following formula shall apply to site density factor (SDF) analysis: 
SDF = EDF + RDF. 
SDF is the minimum tree density to be achieved and maintained on all developed sites, 100 units per acre. 
EDF (existing density factor) is the density value or credit of existing trees to be preserved on a site. 
RDF (replacement density factor) is the density value of new trees to be planted on a site. 
B.  The following steps are used to calculate the required tree preservation or replacement density: 
Step 1. Calculate the Site Density Factor (SDF). 
SDF is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by 100. 
EXAMPLE: A 2.5-acre site has an SDF of 2.5 × 100 = 250 
Step 2. Calculate the Existing Density Factor (EDF). 
EDF is determined by converting the diameter of individual trees to site density units as indicated in Table 1. These units are then totaled to determine the site EDF. 
EXAMPLE: Seven trees will remain on the 2.5-acre site. This includes four 6-inch trees, two 7-inch trees and one 8-inch tree. The following site density units are associated with the trees to be preserved: The total site density units, 98, is the Existing Density Factor (EDF). TABLE INSET: 
Number of Trees Size Class Density Units Site Density 4 6-inch 12 48 2 7-inch 15 30 1 8-inch 20 20 TOTAL 98  
Step 3. Calculate the Replacement Density Factor (RDF). RDF is determined by subtracting the EDF from the SDF. 
EXAMPLE: 250 (SDF) - 98 (EDF) = 152 (RDF) 
This indicates that 152 tree density units are required on this site as replacements conform to the site density factor requirement of 100 units per acre. 
Step 4. Calculate a sample plan for achieving the required Replacement Density Factor (RDF). 
EXAMPLE: Plant eight 21/2-inch, nine 3-inch, seven 4-inch, five 5-inch and three 6-inch diameter trees as presented below: 
Number of Trees Size Class Density Units Site Density 8 21/2-inch 2.5 20 9 3-inch 3.5 31.5 7 4-inch 6 42 5 5-inch 7 35 3 6-inch 8 24 TOTAL 152.5  
Table 1 is used to calculate site density for existing trees by diameter.

The density factor credit for each caliper size of replacement (new) tree is shown in Table 2. An identical credit schedule applies to existing trees which are to be transplanted within the site. Such tree relocation is subject to city planner or designee approval.

Basis of Site Density Tables. Site density is based on a reservation of 25 percent of the total area of each development site as open space. This is the Atlanta Regional Commission minimum standard for impervious ratios in groundwater recharge areas. It is accepted here as a reasonable standard for minimizing flooding potential and preserving the city's tree canopy. For a one-acre lot, this represents an area of 10,890 square feet. The city zoning ordinance requirement for landscaped areas is one tree per 250 square feet. The minimum planting size is 21/2 caliper. This results in 43.56 trees for the 10,890 square foot area. Accordingly, a total of 40 trees in the 21/2-size class is the basis of the tree diameter conversion for replacement trees. As the ordinance favors preservation of existing trees, the density credits are substantially skewed in favor of such preservation.

16.43.200 - Tree bank. 
    When it is determined that the required replacement trees cannot be feasibly accommodated on the project site, the applicant shall deposit funds in the designated account according to the following value calculation method: 
A.  Tree Bank Calculation for Contribution Determination. Calculations for valuing contributions to the tree bank are based on two and one-half-inch caliper replacement trees with a value updated semi-annually, and on file in the parks and recreation department, representing the average cost of materials, labor and guarantee for trees planted in the city area. 
Example calculation: To determine the appropriate contribution to the tree bank, calculate the density factor deficient (DFD) or number of site density units which cannot be planted on the site. Divide the DFD by 2.5 (the density unit value of a two and one-half-inch caliper replacement tree from Table 1), multiply the result by two hundred dollars (cost of a two and one-half-inch caliper replacement tree). 
A 2.5-acre site has a required site density factor (SDF) of 250 units (2.5 × 100 = 250). 
As specified in the approved tree protection plan and tree replacement plan, following development, four six-inch trees, two seven-inch trees and one eight-inch tree will be preserved, totaling ninety-eight site density units (existing density factor). Due to site limitations, only one hundred twenty density units may be planted as replacement trees, the planted density factor (PDF). 
The density factor deficient (DFD) is determined using the formula: DFD = SFD - (EDF + PDF). 
In this example, DFD = 250 - (98 + 120) = 32 units. A total of 72 density units, as calculated using Table 2, must be planted at an alternate location or the developer may elect to contribute the dollar value of these units to the city tree bank. 
The contribution amount is calculated by dividing the density factor deficient (DFD) by the number of density units credited for a two and one-half-inch tree, multiplied by two hundred dollars. 
That is, 32 (DFD) ÷ 2.5 (density units) × 200 (cost per tree) = $2,560.00. 
This value represents the total developer contribution to the tree bank in lieu of added trees planted or preserved. 
Site density credits bear a relationship to the cost of planting the respective tree sizes, favoring planting of larger trees, which bears a relationship to survival rate, through a certain size class, as reflected below:

A.  Where a zoning district boundary is shown on the zoning map as approximately following a corporate limits line, a lot line or the centerline of a street, highway, railroad right-of-way or such lines extended, then such lines shall be construed to be the district boundary line. 
B.  Where a zoning district boundary line is shown on the zoning map as being set back from a street, highway or railroad right-of-way, and approximately parallel thereto, then such district boundary line, unless otherwise specifically indicated, shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the centerline of such street, highway or railroad right-of-way and as being parallel thereto.

In this situation, the requirements of the zoning district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall apply to the balance of the lot, except that such extension shall not include any part of a lot that lies more than fifty feet beyond the zoning district boundary line. 
D.  In the case of a through lot fronting on two approximately parallel streets, that is divided by a zoning district boundary line paralleling the streets, the restrictions of the zoning district in which each frontage of the through lot lies shall apply to that portion of the through lot. 
E.  Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated or abandoned by official action of the city council, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of same and all area included therein shall then and henceforth be subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended district.

17.90.140 - PUD planned unit development district. 
A.  Intent and Purpose. The intent of a planned unit development is to provide for the possibility of relatively large scale, mixed-use planned developments, which incorporate innovative concepts of efficiency in land use, public services delivery, energy conservation, and environmental preservation. A planned unit development may allow more flexible placement, arrangement and orientation of residential structures, the accompanying flexibility in the subdivision of land, and the grouping of open space and accessory facilities such as garages and parking. A planned unit development is intended to allow a mixture and/or density of land uses not otherwise allowed in an established zoning district; by careful site planning the appropriate site improvements are incorporated into the plan which establish compatible relationships between uses within the site, the environmentally sensitive areas of the site, and uses adjacent to the site. 
B.  General Conditions. An area may be considered for rezoning to a PUD planned unit development district if any one of the following conditions exists: 
1.  The characteristics of the specific site plan and uses proposed for the subject property would only be compatible with the surrounding area if the development were limited to those plans and uses as submitted; 
2.  Separate land uses, which would not otherwise be permitted to locate within the same zoning district, are proposed for development on one or more adjacent parcels under single ownership; 
3.  Exceptions or variation from the size, setback, frontage, density, uses or other standards which are required in the conventional zoning districts are being proposed as a part of a planned development. 
C.  Special Requirements. All proposed PUD planned unit development district applications shall conform to the following specific requirements: 
1.  The maximum density shall not to exceed two and two-tenths dwelling units per gross acre. 
2.  The site must abut a public street for a distance of at least one hundred feet. 
3.  A registered engineer, architect, land surveyor or landscape architect shall prepare the plans required for inclusion in an application. The plans shall have their official registration seal. 
4.  Sidewalks shall be required along both sides of all streets within a PUD. The construction standard of the required sidewalks are given in the city development regulations. 
5.  Where a PUD abuts a R-100 district, the PUD shall contain a fifty-foot wide buffer strip along the abutting property lines, unless the property has the same land use and lot size (within a ten percent variation) is adjacent to the R-100 property; and shall further meet all requirements of the city landscape requirements. 
6.  There shall be no land disturbance beyond the areas needed for the construction of roads and other public utilities/facilities, prior to issuance of building permits for the individual buildings within a PUD planned unit development. 
7.  The site proposed for a PUD classification must contain an area of not less than fifty acres, unless specifically reduced by the city council due to special and unusual circumstances. 
D.  Permitted Uses Within a PUD Planned Unit Development District. Any use allowable inherently or by planning commission approval in a conventional zoning district in this title may be proposed for inclusion in a PUD planned unit development district. Each proposed use should be consistent in application with the intent and purpose of the conventional zoning districts in which it is allowed. Only the specific uses proposed in an application and approved shall be allowed in the district. Any addition of uses, change of plans, or increase in size or density shall require a separate amendment to the original approved PUD planned unit development district and shall follow the same administrative process as any other amendment. Initial approval of a PUD planned unit development district by the city does not mean that subsequent amendments to that planned unit development carry any requirement to be approved by the city council for revision to the plan. Unless otherwise stated in this section, the development standards and land uses which are presented with an application for amendment shall, if approved, become the standards for the subject property and as such shall become a part of these zoning regulations. 
E.  Required Report and Plans. Each PUD planned unit development district rezoning application shall include a written report and a set of site plans prepared in accordance with the following guidelines: 
1.  Written Report. A written report shall be submitted which will explain the type, nature, size, intent, and characteristics of the proposed development. This report shall include, where applicable: 
a.  General description and location; 
b.  The physical and socio-economic reasons as to why the uses proposed in the planned development would provide a better overall use of this property over the current zoning; 
c.  The proposed provision of utilities, including water, sewer and drainage facilities; 
d.  The proposed methods for protection of abutting properties;

3.  Administrative Review. of the above identified requirements of the written report and site plan, as well as any other requirements of this title, shall be met before the planned development rezoning request is presented to the planning commission for its review and recommendation. Specific requirements of the administrative review process are as follows: 
a.  The city planner or his designee shall be responsible for reviewing the written report and site plan, and verifying the completeness of the application; prior to the application being placed upon the planning commission agenda; 
b.  The city planner shall periodically prepare, post and distribute a timetable for his review and verification of the required exhibits; 
c.  Neither the planning commission, city planner/engineer, nor any other appointed official shall possess the authority to waive any of the written report or site plan requirements; 
d.  An applicant for a rezoning to PUD planned unit development district, may present a written request to the city council to waive individual requirements of the written report or site plan; however, a separate request must be submitted for each requested waiver, and must include a specific and valid reason as to why the waiver is necessary; economic hardship shall not constitute or be considered as a valid reason for a waiver request. 
F.  PUD planned unit development district is plan specific. 
1.  All further development on the property shall conform to the standards adopted for the district, regardless of any change in ownership. 
2.  The violation of any provision of the approved PUD planned unit development conditions, as submitted and approved under the provisions in this title, shall constitute a violation of these regulations. 
G.  Procedures for Plan Amendments After PUD Approval. 
1.  The planning commission is authorized to approve minor amendments or changes to a planned unit development district without the approval of the city council. Minor changes include increase in lot sizes, decrease in density or number of lots, and street modifications that would not affect adjacent properties. 
2.  All changes to the approved planned unit development which constitute a major amendment, shall be treated as a new application for a PUD planned unit development and shall be required per this section to be reconsidered as a change of conditions of zoning approval. Major changes include reduction in lot sizes, changes in conditions of zoning, increase in density or number of lots, street modifications that would affect adjacent properties, change in points of street access onto existing streets, and other changes deemed major by the city planner/engineer.

(Ord. No. 08-016, § 1, 8-7-08) 
17.100.090 - Pervious parking surfaces for non-single family residential uses. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote health, safety, and welfare within the city and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits, through provisions designed for allowance of pervious pavement systems as part of a stormwater management plan. The city recognizes that stormwater runoff has been traditionally treated as a by-product of development to be disposed of as quickly and efficiently as possible. The result has often been increased flooding, degradation of surface and subsurface water quality, soil erosion and sedimentation, and a failure to capitalize on the benefit of creative stormwater management. It is the intent of this section to encourage the use of best management practices (BMPs) which are structural, vegetative, or managerial practices designed to treat, prevent, or reduce degradation of water quality due to stormwater runoff. All development projects subject to review under the requirements of this section shall be designed, constructed, and maintained using BMPs to prevent flooding, protect water quality, reduce soil erosion, maintain and contribute to the aesthetic values of the project. 
B.  General Requirements for Pervious Pavement Systems for Non-Single Family Residential Uses. 
1.  Pervious pavement systems shall be designed to manage stormwater through the prevention of flooding and the degradation of water quality related to stormwater runoff and soil erosion from proposed development. 
2.  Pervious pavement systems shall be designed by a registered professional engineer or landscape architect and installed by a contractor qualified in the particular system used. 
3.  The pervious pavement designer shall include maintenance instructions to the property owner along with a maintenance schedule. 
4.  Pervious pavement systems generally consist of a pavement layer and a detention layer. The pavement layer must be capable of supporting vehicular or pedestrian traffic and have sufficient porosity to allow rainwater to percolate into the layer below. The detention layer typically consists of gravel or crushed stone and has sufficient voids to store water after a storm until such time as the water can infiltrate into the soil below. In some areas the infiltration rate of the natural soil below the pavement system is sufficient to justify eliminating the detention layer. 
5.  At a minimum, a pervious pavement system must be designed to adequately accommodate a NRCS two-year twenty-four-hour design storm. The storage capacity of the pervious pavement system, which includes the pavement layer and the detention layer, must be designed to have sufficient detention capacity such that the stormwater will infiltrate into the soil below and can accommodate a second NRCS two-year twenty-four-hour design storm within five days of the previous storm. 
6.  Pervious concrete systems shall be designed in accordance with ACI Specification 522.1 or equivalent standard. 
7.  Pervious concrete shall be installed by a qualified National Ready Mixed Concrete Association (NRMCA) certified pervious concrete installer or craftsman or equivalent who must be onsite to oversee the each placement crew during all pervious concrete placements. 
C.  For Development of New Properties. 
1.  Property is considered new property if the property proposed for development has no existing construction. Such properties shall: 
a.  Use pervious paving material for a minimum of ten percent of the parking spaces if parking requires a minimum of two hundred fifty spaces such that one-hundred percent of the total area covered by pervious pavement systems designed to allow the infiltration of water may be considered pervious. 
b.  Provide a comprehensive stormwater management plan that emphasizes infiltration and onsite retention of stormwater for at least the NRCS two-year design storm event through a combination of methods including buffer strips, swales, rainwater gardens, pervious pavement systems and other low impact development methods. The stormwater management plan must be designed by a registered professional engineer or landscape architect and installed as designed by a qualified contractor. 
c.  A survey showing exact dimensions and arrangement of pervious and impervious surfaces. 
D.  For Re-development of Existing Properties. 
1.  Property is considered existing property if the property proposed for re- development has existing improvements. 
2.  Existing properties that do not exceed the maximum allowed impervious surface for new properties shall meet the development requirements for new properties upon the placement of additional building(s), a minimum twenty-five percent expansion to an existing building, or parking area. 
3.  A survey shall be submitted showing calculations of the exact dimensions of all existing impervious surfaces and of the lot before and after completion of the project. 
4.  In replacing existing impervious surfaces with surfaces designed to be pervious, the applicant must give priority to replacing those surfaces closest to natural bodies of water (lakes, ponds, rivers, streams or ocean) or those surfaces where the replacement is most likely to improve stormwater management. 
E.  Site Design. 
1.  Rooftop runoff shall be directed to pervious pavement systems, open channels, or vegetated areas to avoid roadways or the stormwater conveyance system. 
2.  Create a variable width, naturally vegetated or pervious buffer system along all drainageways that also encompasses critical environmental features such as the one hundred-year floodplain, steep slopes, and wetlands. 
3.  Minimize clearing and grading of woodlands and native vegetation to the minimum amount needed to build lots, allow access, and provide fire protection. 
4.  Conserve trees and other vegetation at each site by planting additional vegetation, clustering tree areas, and promoting the use of native plants. 
5.  The use of pervious pavement systems for paved areas is encouraged. 
6.  New constructed stormwater outfalls to public waters must provide for filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface debris before discharge. Pervious pavement systems may be used as one method to achieve this requirement. 
F.  Maintenance Inspection. 
1.  The city reserves the right of access for periodic preventative maintenance in accordance with the recorded stormwater facility maintenance agreement. 
2.  Inspection reports shall be maintained by the city for all stormwater management systems. 
3.  Inspection reports for stormwater management systems shall include the following: 
i.  The date of inspection; 
ii.  Name of inspector; 
iii.  The condition of: 
a.  Vegetation or filter media; 
b.  Fences or other safety devices; 
c.  Spillways, valves, or other control structures; 
d.  Embankments, slopes, and safety benches; 
e.  Reservoir or treatment areas; 
f.  Inlet and outlet channels or structures; 
g.  Underground drainage; 
h.  Sediment and debris accumulation in storage and forebay areas; 
i.  Any other item that could affect the proper function of the stormwater management system. 
4.  Description of needed maintenance. After notification is provided to the owner of any deficiencies discovered from an inspection of a stormwater management system, the owner shall have thirty days to correct the deficiencies. The city shall then conduct a subsequent inspection to ensure completion of the repairs. Should the owner fail to correct the deficiencies, the owner will be issued a citation for violation of the city code. 
G.  Reserved. 
H.  Reserved. 
I.  Applicability. 
1.  All non-single family residential development located within the city must meet the minimum standards of this section for stormwater design. 
2.  Any project in this jurisdiction which has obtained building permits on or before the date of adoption of this section shall be exempt from the requirements of this section. 
J.  This section shall take effect and be in force immediately upon adoption by the mayor and council.

17.130.100 - Ordinance enforcement procedures. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide objective standards and processes for the enforcement of city ordinances. 
B.  Definitions. For purposes of this section, the zoning enforcement officer (ZEO), ordinance enforcement officer (OEO), and code enforcement officer (CEO), shall have the same functions and duties. 
C.  Three-Step Process for Ordinance Enforcement: 
    Step 1: Any citizen has the right to report an ordinance violation. The identity of the citizen reporting the violation should remain anonymous to the extent possible and should direct their report to the code enforcement officer (CEO). In the event that the only evidence of the violation is from the reporting citizen and ultimately a citation is issued, the reporting citizen should know that he/she might be called to testify in municipal court as to the violation. The CEO should personally confirm the existence of a violation when possible. Additionally, the CEO will verify that the violation is indeed of a current and legitimate city ordinance. If immediate action is required, and the offense is of a nature to require the immediate issuance of a citation in the opinion of the CEO, then a citation will be issued in accordance with Step 3. Upon the first violation of a city ordinance not requiring immediate action, the city planner, at the request of the CEO, will mail a letter to the party responsible for the violation. The letter will include the date the violation was observed and a copy of the city ordinance for clarification to the responsible party. A deadline will be included within which to comply with the ordinance at issue. The letter will be sent over the name of the code enforcement officer using city of Auburn letterhead. After the allocated time has elapsed or the same ordinance is again violated, Step 2 is initiated. Nothing in this section restricts the CEO from serving notice in person, or verbally. When verbal notice is given, written confirmation of the notice will follow within three days, in the manner as required above, and will be effective as of the date of the first notice. 
    Step 2: A citation will be issued by the city and delivered by a police officer employed by the city or the CEO depending on the urgency of the situation or conditions at the time of occurrence. The citation will restate the violation and note that this is the second occurrence of the same violation and that the required resolution as stipulated in Step 1 has not been complied with as required. The citation will state the date and time that the responsible party in violation must appear in municipal court. On that date, the judge will hear the case and determine whether a violation of the ordinance occurred. If found in violation, the responsible party may be fined for the violation plus appropriate court costs. The fine imposed will be consistent with fines imposed by local municipalities for similar violations.

Chapter 17.170 - AMENDMENTS 
Sections: 

17.170.010 - Zoning ordinance and map amendment procedure. 
A.  This title, including the city zoning maps, may be amended from time to time by the city council, but no amendment, including the approval of a special use permit shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or shall have first been submitted to the planning commission for review and recommendation. 
B.  If the planning commission fails to submit a report within forty days of its first meeting after it has received an amendment or special use permit request complete in all respects, it shall be deemed to have given a recommendation of "no comment" on the proposed amendment or special use permit. However, the planning commission and the applicant for an amendment or special use permit may jointly agree to an extension of the forty-day period. 
C.  Before the planning commission submits a report, or the city council enacts an amendment or special use permit, they shall each hold a public hearing thereon. At least fifteen, but not more than forty-five days prior to the date of each hearing, the city planner, acting for the planning commission and the city council, shall cause to be published within the official organ of the city, a notice of each hearing. The notice shall state the time, place and purpose of the hearing. 
D.  If a proposed special use permit or amendment is for the rezoning of property and involves a change in the zoning classification of ten, or fewer parcels of land, then: 
1.  The notice, in addition to the requirements in subsection C of this section, shall include the location of the property, the present zoning classification of the property, and the proposed zoning classification of the property or proposed special use; 
2.  The applicant shall place a sign provided by the city containing the information outlined in subsection (D)(1) of this section in a conspicuous location on the property not less than fifteen days prior to the date of the hearing before the mayor and city council; and 
3.  The applicant shall give notice of the proposed rezoning or special use permit by regular mail to the property owner of record and to all abutting property owners of record as shown on the applicable county tax records. The notice shall be mailed at least ten days prior to the date of the planning commission meeting and shall include a description of the application, and the date, time and place of the public hearings before the planning commission and the mayor and city council. 
    Notice deposited the United States mail with adequate postage thereon and addressed to the last known address of the property owners as shown on the county tax records shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this section. The applicant shall provide a certificate of mailing (Post Office Form 3877) to the city evidencing the mailing of the notice prior to the planning commission hearing.

(Ord. No. 08-016, § 1, 8-7-08) 
17.170.030 - Standards governing exercise of the zoning power. 
    The city council finds that the following standards are relevant in balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality or general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of property and shall govern the exercise of the zoning power: 
A.  Whether a proposed rezoning will permit a use that is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property; 
B.  Whether a proposed rezoning will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property; 
C.  Whether the property to be affected by a proposed rezoning has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned; 
D.  Whether the proposed rezoning will result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities or schools; 
E.  Whether the proposed rezoning is in conformity with the policy and intent of the land use plan; and 
F.  Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the proposed rezoning. 
(Ord. 265A (part), 2001) 
17.170.040 - Impact analysis. 
    If a proposed amendment is for the rezoning of property or is for a special use permit, then: 
A.  The initiating party, if a party other than the city council or planning commission, shall be required to file with its application for amendment a written, documented analysis of the impact of the proposed zoning with respect to each of the matters enumerated in Section 17.170.030. The zoning proposal and analysis shall be a public record. 
B.  The city planner shall, with respect to each zoning proposal, investigate and make a recommendation with respect to each of the matters enumerated in Section 17.170.030. The city planner shall make a report of the investigation and recommendations to the planning commission and city council, and this report shall be made part of the public record. The city planner shall not be required to make a recommendation with respect to each of the matters enumerated in Section 17.170.040, if the city council or planning commission initiate a change in zoning of the official zoning map on ten or more parcels 
C.  The planning commission shall, with respect to each zoning proposal, investigate and make a recommendation with respect to each of the matters enumerated in Section 17.170.030 above. The planning commission shall make a written record of its investigation and recommendations, and this record shall be a public record.

(Ord. No. 08-016, § 1, 8-7-08) 
17.170.050 - Action by city council. 
    Following its public hearing the city council may: 
A.  Adopt the proposed amendment as presented; 
B.  Adopt the proposed amendment as revised or supplemented by conditions of approval established by the city council. The revisions may include, if the proposed amendment is for the rezoning of property, rezoning to the proposed zoning district with conditions or rezoning to any other less intense zoning district with or without conditions; 
C.  Deny the proposed amendment in whole or in part; 
D.  Table the proposal; or 
E.  Approve the petition for amendment to be withdrawn with the consent of a majority of the city council. 
(Ord. 265A (part), 2001) 
17.170.060 - Conditional zoning. 
    In adopting an amendment to the zoning map, or approving a special use permit or a variance, the city council may impose special conditions which it deems necessary in order to make the requested action acceptable and consistent with the purposes of the district(s) involved and to further the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. Such conditions may consist of: setback requirements from any lot line; specified or prohibited locations for buildings, parking, loading or storage areas or other land uses; driveway curb cut restrictions; restrictions as to what land uses or activities shall be permitted; maximum building heights or other dimensions; special drainage or erosion provisions; landscaping or planted area, which may include the location, type and maintenance of plant materials; fences, walls, berms or other buffering provisions, or protective measures; preservation of existing trees or other vegetation; special measures to alleviate undesirable views, light, glare, noise, dust or odor; permitted hours of operation; architectural style; a requirement that the existing building(s) be retained; a requirement that developers must build according to the site plans as adopted; a limitation on exterior modifications of existing buildings; or any other requirement that the city council may deem appropriate and necessary as a condition of rezoning or issuance of a variance or special use permit. Said conditions: 
A.  Shall only be valid if they are included in the motion approving the amendment for adoption; 
B.  Shall be in effect for the period of time specified in the amendment; 
C.  Shall be required of the property owner and all subsequent owners as a condition of their use of the property; and 
D.  Shall be interpreted and continually enforced by the city planner in the same manner as any other provision of this title. 
(Ord. 265A (part), 2001) 
(Ord. No. 08-016, § 1, 8-7-08) 
17.170.070 - Special use permits. 
A.  The special use permit is designed to be used when: 
1.  A Special use listed under the zoning district is desired for development; 
2.  A unique use not addressed in any zoning district is desired for development and is not likely to be duplicated within city; 
3.  The special use would be consistent with the needs of the neighborhood or the community as a whole, would be compatible with the neighborhood, and would not be in conflict with the overall objective of the Comprehensive Plan. 
B.  Special Use Permit Procedure. 
    In order to accommodate some land uses, the special use permit allows the city council to approve a special use on a particular parcel without changing the general zoning district. However, the official zoning map is noted when a parcel is approved for a special use permit. Approval shall be subject to the requirements set forth within Section 17.170.020, the additional requirements below, and any additional conditions deemed necessary to ensure the compatibility of the special use with the surrounding properties. The special use permit shall not be used for securing for conceptual proposals which may not be undertaken for some time. The minimum requirements for a special use permit are: 
1.  Any uses permitted under a special use permit shall also conform to the requirements of this title and the development regulations for the use as found in the zoning district. 
2.  The application and review process for a special use permit shall be the same as for a zoning map amendment and shall meet all the zoning district requirements under which the special use is found. In addition to the information and/or site plans which are required to be submitted for the proposed development, additional information deemed necessary by the city planner in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area shall be submitted. In the review process, particular emphasis shall be given to the evaluation of the characteristics of the proposed use in relationship to its immediate neighborhood and the compatibility of the proposed use with its neighborhood. 
3.  Special Use Permits. In the approval process for a special use permit, the city council shall consider the policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan, particularly in relationship to the proposed site and surrounding areas and shall consider the potential adverse impact on the surrounding area, specially in regards, but not limited to: 
a.  Effect on usability of adjacent or nearby property; 
b.  Ingress, egress and off-street parking; 
c.  Effect on schools, public facilities, fire, and police services; 
d.  Hours and manner of operation; 
e.  Buffering and screening; 
f.  Duration of special use permit. 
4.  If an application is approved and a special use permit is granted, all conditions which may have been attached to the approval are binding on the property. All subsequent development and use of the property shall be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions. Once established, the special use shall be in continuous operation. Upon discovery that the operation of the special use has or had ceased for a period of ninety days or more and the owner of the property has not requested voluntary termination of the special use permit, the city planner shall forward a report to the city council through the planning commission which may recommend that action be taken to remove the special use permit from the property. 
5.  Changes to a special use, or development of a site for the special use, shall be treated as an amendment to the special use permit and shall be subject to the same application and review process as a new application. 
6.  The special use for which a special use permit is granted shall commence operations or construction within twelve months of the date of approval by the city council. If, at the end of this twelve-month period, the city planner determines that active efforts are not proceeding toward operation or construction, a report may be forwarded to the city council through the planning commission which may recommend that action be taken to remove the special use permit from the property. 
7.  An application for a special use permit in a residential district and which use is proposed to operate in a dwelling or as an accessory use to a dwelling is subject to the following additional requirements: 
a.  The special use permit shall be valid for no more than a two-year period. Upon or before the expiration of a special use permit, the owner shall make application to continue the special use permit if continuance is desired. However, after the first two-year period the city council may waive the two-year time limitation with the concurrence of the planning commission. 
b.  The special use shall operate within the dwelling on the property or, if approved by the city council, in an accessory structure. 
c.  The exterior character of the dwelling shall be preserved in its residential state and there shall be no outside evidence of the operation of the special use to the neighborhood, except for any accessory structure approved by the city council. 
d.  The owner of the property shall occupy the property and shall operate any business associated with the special use. 
e.  The owner of the property shall submit with the application a signed statement in which he/she agrees that the special use permit, if approved, shall automatically terminate in the event that the property is sold, transferred or otherwise conveyed to any other party, or the business which operates the special use is sold, transferred, or otherwise conveyed or discontinued. The owner shall also agree to notify the city planner in writing upon the occurrence of any of these events. 
f.  In addition to the information and/or site plans required by this section, the owner of the property shall submit with the application for a special use permit information regarding the ownership of any business associated with the use, the experience and background qualifications related to the operation of said business, prior similar businesses operated, applicable state of Georgia certifications, licenses and like information. 
8.  The owner of the property approved for a special use permit, may voluntarily request termination of the special use permit by notifying the city planner in writing. The city planner shall notify the city council through the planning commission of the request for voluntary termination as they occur. The city council may approve or deny the request for voluntary termination and if approved, shall change the official zoning maps to reflect any voluntary termination. The approval of a special use permit for a specific use which may be operated by a lessee under a private agreement with a lessor in any nonresidential district shall not obligate the city council to be responsible for or be required to resolve any disputes which may arise out of the voluntary termination of the special use permit by the property owner. 
9.  The city shall have the right to periodically examine the operation of the specific use to determine compliance with the requirements and any conditions. If the city planner determines that the requirements and conditions are being violated, a written notice shall be issued to the owner of the property outlining the nature of the violation and giving the owner of the property a maximum of ten days to come into compliance. If after ten days the violations continue to exist, the city planner shall forward a report to the city council through the planning commission which may recommend that action be taken to remove the special use permit from the property. 
10.  Upon approval by the city council, a special use permit shall be identified on the official zoning maps. 
11.  Upon approval by the city council of a special use permit the owner of the property shall be issued a notice from the city planner which states the specific use permitted, the requirements of this section and any conditions attached to the approval. 
12.  The city shall not issue a certificate of occupancy for the specific use unless all requirements and conditions of the special use permit have been fulfilled by the owner of the property.

(Ord. No. 08-016, §§ 1, 9, 10, 8-7-08) 
17.170.080 - Withdrawal of application for amendment, variance or special use permit. 
    Once an application for an amendment to the zoning map or an application for a variance or special use permit has been made, the applicant may withdraw such application without prejudice only until such time as the legal advertisement of a public hearing thereon is placed. No application shall be allowed to be withdrawn without action by the city council after public notice of the public hearing has been placed. All applications, having been advertised, shall be considered by the city council or zoning board of appeals, as appropriate, and shall receive final action. 
(Ord. 265A (part), 2001) 
17.170.090 - Lapse of time requirement for an amendment, variance or special use permit reapplication. 
    The following shall apply to the applicable re-application: 
    If an application is denied by the city council, or zoning board of appeals, as appropriate, no application or reapplication for the same zoning map amendment, variance or special use permit affecting the same land or any portion thereof shall be acted upon within twelve months from the date of last action, unless such twelve month period is waived by the city council or zoning board of appeals as appropriate, and in no case may such an application or reapplication be reconsidered in less than six months from the date of that action by the city council or zoning board of appeals, as appropriate. Administrative variances shall not be subject to this time lapse requirement as outlined in Section 17.150.090. 
(Ord. 265A (part), 2001) 
17.170.100 - Actions to be taken if plans of property owner are not implemented within specified time limits. 
A.  For any zoning map amendment for which the city council is not the applicant, and upon which property a development permit, building permit or certificate of occupancy has not been issued within twelve months of the date of approval of said amendment, the city council may review the zoning district classification of the property and determine whether it shall be continued or initiated for rezoning. 
B.  Properties may first be reviewed by the planning commission, which shall make findings and recommendations as it deems appropriate.

Chapter 17.180 - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE PROTECTION DISTRICTS 
Sections: 

17.180.010 - Findings and purpose. 
A.  It is essential that the quality of the city's public drinking water be insured. It is therefore necessary to protect the subsurface water resource of the city and surrounding communities that rely on it as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within groundwater recharge areas, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These groundwater recharge areas are replenished by infiltration of stormwater runoff in zones of the surface. 
B.  Groundwaters are susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is therefore necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge zones in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
C.  The objectives of this chapter are to: (1) protect the groundwater by prohibiting land uses that generate dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; (2) protect the groundwater by limiting density of development; and, (3) protect the groundwater by ensuring that the development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality. 
(Ord. 04-002 (part), 2004) 
17.180.020 - Establishment of a groundwater recharge area district. 
    A groundwater recharge area district is established, which shall correspond to all lands within the city that are mapped as most significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. This district shall be an overlay district. 
(Ord. 04-002 (part), 2004) 
17.180.030 - Determination of pollution susceptibility. 
    Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrologic Atlas 20. The map is adopted and made a part of this title. 
(Ord. 04-002 (part), 2004) 
17.180.040 - Groundwater protection standards. 
    Development of property within the groundwater recharge area district shall have the following groundwater protection standards: 
A.  New waste disposal facilities of any type must have synthetic liners and leachate collection systems. 
B.  No land disposal of hazardous waste shall be permitted within any significant groundwater recharge area. 
C.  For all groundwater recharge areas, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials shall take place on an impermeable surface having spill and leak protection approved by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division (EPD). 
D.  For all significant groundwater recharge areas, new above ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks larger than six hundred fifty gallons must have secondary containment for one hundred ten percent of tank volume or one hundred ten percent of the largest tanks in a cluster of tanks. Tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt if they comply with all federal regulations. 
E.  New facilities that handle hazardous materials of the types listed in Section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts of ten thousand pounds or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and local fire code requirements. 
F.  New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall not be permitted. 
(Ord. 04-002 (part), 2004) 
17.180.050 - Minimum lot sizes and septic systems. 
    No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank unless Gwinnett County and/or Barrow County Health Department, Environmental Health Section, first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the State of Georgia Department of Human Resources DHR Manual for On-Site Sewerage Management Systems. The Gwinnett County Health Department has adhered to the manual since 1985. 
    New homes and mobile homes (including lots within a new mobile home park) served by a septic tank/drain field system shall be on lots having minimum size limitations as follows, based on application of Table MT-1 of the DHR Manual (hereinafter DHR Table MT-1). The minimum set forth in Table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A-F) of the DHR Manual. 
A.  One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot size, calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area as defined by the Hydrologic Atlas Number 20; 
B.  One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot size, calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area as defined by the Hydrologic Atlas Number 20; 
C.  One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot size, calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area as defined by the Hydrologic Atlas Number 20.

Chapter 17.190 - WETLAND PROTECTION DISTRICTS 
Sections: 

17.190.010 - Findings and purpose. 
    The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. The wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state of Georgia. 
    The Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Georgia Department of Community Affairs have determined that each local government with classified wetlands located in its jurisdictions must adopt a wetlands protection ordinance under the requirements of House Bill 215, Georgia's 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation and the rules promulgated thereunder. 
    It is therefore necessary for the city to ensure protection for wetlands by ensuring that development activities do not adversely affect wetlands. 
(Ord. 04-001 (part), 2004) 
17.190.020 - Wetland protection districts. 
    This section shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection districts as defined in this title and located within the jurisdiction of the city. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this title, shows the general location of wetlands and of the wetland protection district and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is adopted by reference and declared to be part of this title. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the Auburn City Planner. 
(Ord. 04-001 (part), 2004) 
(Ord. No. 08-016, § 1, 8-7-08) 
17.190.030 - Wetland protection districts boundaries. 
    The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/owner to seek U.S. Army Corp of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this title does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

17.190.040 - Local development permits. 
    No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection districts without written permission from the city or its designee in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this title and other applicable regulations. All activities within a wetland protection district that are not exempted in Section 17.190.050 of this chapter, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. The city planner, or any other plan review designee assigned to administer this title, will consult the generalized wetland map to determine if the proposed land disturbance activity is within fifty feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined from the generalized wetland map. If the proposed development is within a mapped wetland area or within fifty feet, a U.S. Army Corp of Engineers' determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present and that a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 permit or letter of permission. If the city planner or designee determines that the proposed development is not near a wetland protection boundary; or it is not the type of activity that would cause the alteration of wetlands, the city may proceed with normal procedures in issuing a land development permit.

Chapter 17.200 - WATER SUPPLY WATERSHED OVERLAY DISTRICT 
Sections: 

17.200.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The quality of public drinking water supplies must be assured. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation, which threaten the storage capacity of reservoirs and impair the quality of public drinking water supplies. Stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients, and sediments into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive, and rendering water resources unusable for recreation and other uses. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in potential risks of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. Therefore, land use activities within water supply watersheds must be regulated to ensure that public water supplies remain clean. This chapter establishes standards consistent with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria for Water Supply Watersheds (Rule 391-3-16-01) to ensure water quality in the watershed system is not compromised by land activities such as grading, septic systems, and accidental release of contaminants. The intent of this chapter is to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply, to maintain the yield of water supply watersheds, and to ensure water can be treated to meet federal and state drinking water standards.

The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and this paragraph. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least fifty horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least fifty horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than twenty-five feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least twenty-five horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the local issuing authority;

(Ord. No. 17-002, § III, 4-20-17) 
18.04.040 - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
A.  General Provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of Section 18.04.040.B. and C. of this chapter. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit. 
B.  Minimum Requirements/BMPs. 
1.  Best management practices as set forth in Section 18.04.040.B. and C. of this chapter shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
2.  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
3.  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
4.  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
5.  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections C.15, 16 and 17, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
C.  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
1.  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
2.  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
3.  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
4.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
5.  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
6.  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
7.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
8.  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
9.  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
10.  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
11.  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
12.  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
13.  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
14.  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments onsite or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Section 18.04.040.B.2. of this chapter; 
15.  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
(i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
(ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
16.  There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
(i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
(ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
17.  There is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act 10 Revised June 2016 and if the requirement to maintain a twenty-five-foot buffer would consume at least eighteen percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than five hundred square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in [EPD Rule] 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than five thousand square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least fourteen days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
D.  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Section 18.04.040.B. and C. of this chapter. 
E.  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 17-002, § IV, 4-20-17) 
18.04.050 - Application/permit process. 
A.  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
B.  Application Requirements. 
1.  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Auburn without first obtaining a permit from the city to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
2.  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in Section 18.04.050.C. of this chapter. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of Section 18.04.040.B. and C. of this chapter will be met. applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by six copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
3.  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of 11 revised June 2016 O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
4.  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within thirty-five days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by Section 18.04.040.C.15, 16 and 17 have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per Section 18.04.050.B.6., have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
5.  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this chapter section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
6.  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
C.  Plan requirements. 
1.  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in Section 18.04.040.B. and C. of this chapter, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
2.  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
D.  Permits. 
1.  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
2.  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this chapter, any variances required by Section 18.04.040.C.15, 16 and 17 are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per Section 18.04.050.B.6. are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
3.  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this chapter, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
4.  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
5.  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
6.  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7 (f)(1). 
(Ord. No. 17-002, § V, 4-20-17) 
18.04.060 - Inspection and enforcement. 
A.  The city will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
B.  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
C.  The city shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
D.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
E.  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 (a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
F.  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 (a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have ninety days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within ninety days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority. 
(Ord. No. 17-002, § VI, 4-20-17) 
18.04.070 - Penalties and incentives. 
A.  Failure to Obtain a Permit for Land-Disturbing Activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
B.  Stop Work Orders. 
1.  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this chapter, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
2.  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
3.  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
4.  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
C.  Bond Forfeiture.

18.08.040 - Applicability. 
    This chapter shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection area as defined in Section 18.08.030 of this chapter. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations. 
A.  Grandfather Provisions. This chapter shall not apply to the following activities: 
1.  Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for said use on or before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
2.  Existing development and on-going land disturbance activities including, but not limited to, existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that new development or land disturbance activities on said properties will be subject to all applicable buffer requirements. 
3.  Any land development activity that is under construction, fully approved for development, scheduled for permit approval or has been submitted for approval as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
4.  Land development activity that has not been submitted for approval, but that is part of a larger master development plan, such as for an office park or other phased development that has been previously approved within two years of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
B.  Exemptions. The following specific activities are exempt from this chapter. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property. 
1.  Activities for the purpose of building one of the following: 
a.  A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or utility line; 
b.  Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures; 
c.  Intrusions necessary to provide access to a property;

2.  Public sewer line easements paralleling the creek, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least twenty-five feet from the top of the bank. This includes the impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including, but not limited to, manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in said easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited in subsection (B)(1) of this section. 
3.  Land development activities within a right-of-way existing at the time this chapter takes effect or approved under the terms of this chapter. 
4.  Within an easement of any utility existing at the time this chapter takes effect or approved under the terms of this chapter, land disturbance activities and the impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. 
5.  Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report said work to the city clerk or his/her designee on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform the work within the time period as may be determined by the city clerk or his/her designee to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment the emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area. 
6.  Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If the activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer. 
    After the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, it shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities. 
    Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to Section 18.08.050(B) of this chapter. 
(Ord. 07-003 § 4, 2006) 
18.08.050 - Land development requirements. 
A.  Buffer and Setback Requirements. All land development activity subject to this chapter shall meet the following requirements: 
1.  An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for fifty feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. 
2.  An additional setback shall be maintained for twenty-five feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback. 
3.  No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback. 
B.  Variance Procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
1.  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this chapter, and the city clerk finds and determines that the requirements of this chapter prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the board of zoning appeals of the city may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided the variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
2.  Except as provided above, the city clerk or his/her designee shall grant no variance from any provision of this chapter without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote by the board of zoning appeals of the city. The city clerk or his/her designee shall give public notice of each said public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city clerk or his/her designee shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. 
    Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
b.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance codified in this chapter would create an extreme hardship. 
    Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
3.  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
4.  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; 
d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and 
f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment. 
(Ord. 07-003 § 5, 2006) 
18.08.060 - Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements. 
    This chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this chapter should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
(Ord. 07-003 § 6, 2006) 
18.08.070 - Additional information requirements for development on buffer zone properties. 
    Any permit applications for property requiring buffers and setbacks hereunder must include the following: 
A.  A site plan showing: 
1.  The location of all streams on the property, 
2.  Limits of required stream buffers and setbacks on the property, 
3.  Buffer zone topography with contour lines at no greater than five-foot contour intervals, 
4.  Delineation of forested and open areas in the buffer zone, and 
5.  Detailed plans of all proposed land development in the buffer and of all proposed impervious cover within the setback; 
B.  A description of all proposed land development within the buffer and setback; and 
C.  Any other documentation that the city clerk or his/her designee may reasonably deem necessary for review of the application and to insure that the buffer zone ordinance is addressed in the approval process. 
    All buffer and setback areas must be recorded on the final plat of the property following plan approval. 
(Ord. 07-003 § 7, 2006) 
18.08.080 - Responsibility. 
    Neither the issuance of a development permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof, nor with the provisions of this chapter shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damage to persons or property; nor shall the issuance of any permit hereunder serve to impose any liability upon the city, its officers or employees, for injury or damage to persons or property. 
(Ord. 07-003 § 8, 2006) 
18.08.090 - Inspection. 
    The city clerk or his/her designee may cause inspections of the work in the buffer or setback to be made periodically during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following completion of the work.

Chapter 18.12 - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT 
Sections: 

18.12.010 - General provisions. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
1.  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
2.  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
3.  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
4.  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
5.  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
6.  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
7.  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  This chapter shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (B)(2) of this section. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
a.  New development that involves the creation of five thousand square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more;

All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city clerk or his/her designee before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city clerk or his/her designee may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
    Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
F.  Stormwater Credits for Nonstructural Measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection A of this section. The applicant may, if approved by the city clerk or his/her designee, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
G.  Drainage System Guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 10-014, adopted Sept. 2, 2010, enacted new provisions to be designated as Section 18.74. In order to maintain the numeric style of the code, said new provisions have been redesignated as Ch. 18.14. Original ordinance designations have been maintained in the history notes following each section. 

18.14.010 - Findings. 
    The City of Auburn Mayor and City Council make the following findings of fact: 
A.  The City of Auburn, Georgia (hereinafter "the city" or "Auburn") is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I and III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the city. 
B.  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of Auburn hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund and establish rates for stormwater management services. 
C.  In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, Auburn is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its city Charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. 
D.  Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within the city's service area. 
E.  A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city's service area and surrounding areas. 
F.  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city's service area. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
G.  Failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the public sanitary sewer system and private septic systems thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into those systems. 
H.  Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the potential degradation of the surface water quality in area water bodies. 
I.  The city is required under federal and state regulations [i.e. the Federal Clean Water Act, the City's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (hereinafter "NPDES") Phase II stormwater permit to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature. 
J.  Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES Phase II stormwater permit, Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District and along with other city stormwater program activities will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for water quality management, drainage system maintenance, flood control and other program activities. 
K.  The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. 
L.  The professional engineering and financing analysis and related documents prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy. 
M.  Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city's service area in concert with other water resource management programs. 
N.  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city's service area. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the city's service area is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
O.  The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways. 
P.  The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including, but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management services which result in services to such properties and the owners thereof. 
Q.  A stormwater management program (hereinafter "SWMP") provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city's service area, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the city's service area through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms. 
R.  The area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge. 
S.  A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city's service area. Such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
T.  It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, systems or facilities, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and nonoperating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.

    "Stormwater coordinator" means the person designated by the city administrator to administer the provisions of this article. 
    "Stormwater user fee charge" means the periodic user fee charge imposed pursuant to this article by the Auburn Stormwater Utility for providing stormwater management services. This term shall exclude special charges to the owners of particular properties for services, systems or facilities related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects, onsite stormwater control systems and other stormwater management services provided by Auburn for which a corresponding fee is collected for the service rendered. 
    "Undeveloped land" means land in its unaltered natural condition or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural condition shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have minimal impervious surface, which impedes the infiltration of stormwater runoff or causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural condition by the creation or installation of five hundred square feet or less of impervious surface. 
    "User" is defined as any person who uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management.

18.14.070 - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions. 
    Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no public or private property located in the service area of Auburn shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities. Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows: 
A.  Railroad rights-of-way (tracks) shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, and/or other improved property used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
B.  Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by GDOT in association with GDOT rights-of-way and road systems. However, maintenance buildings and/or other improved property used for GDOT purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. All other state, federal, and county properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties. 
C.  City and county streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by the county. However, other improved property used for city and county purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
D.  In consideration for the city allowing the stormwater utility to use the city's existing street, curbs, gutters, drainageways and ditches, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural and manmade within and owned by the city which controls and diverts surface water for the purposes of collecting, diverting, transporting and controlling surface and stormwaters; the utility shall not charge the city a stormwater user fee charge for the city's impervious surface area resulting from the city's impervious surfaces which are owned and/or maintained by the city within the public rights-of-way. 
E.  Any property whereby one hundred percent of the stormwater runoff is contained or infiltrated on the property and no stormwater runoff is discharged, via overland flow or manmade conveyance to adjacent properties or rights-of-way for all storm events up to and including the one hundred-year twenty-four-hour storm event. 
(Ord. No. 10-014, § 18.74.106, 9-2-10) 
18.14.080 - Enforcement methods and inspections. 
A.  All property owners of improved property within the service area of Auburn shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all applicable city development regulations, ordinances, and state and federal laws. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a violation of this article and be subject to citation and prosecution in the Auburn Municipal Court. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense, subject to the penalties set forth the City of Auburn Code of Ordinances. 
B.  Alternately, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the stormwater utility coordinator, the city may elect to sue in the superior court of the county in which the property is located to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the superior court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed. 
C.  The city shall have the right for its designated officers and employees to enter upon public and private property during reasonable hours, and after reasonable notice to the owner thereof, in order to assure compliance with the provisions of this article, and state and federal law. Such inspections shall generally be limited to the following purposes: 
(1)  Inspecting or conducting engineering analyses on existing stormwater management systems and facilities located on-site; or 
(2)  Determining that stormwater management systems and facilities need to be constructed. 
(Ord. No. 10-014, § 18.74.107, 9-2-10; Ord. No. 11-005, § 18.74.107, 4-7-11) 
18.14.090 - Stormwater user fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments. 
    Failure to receive a stormwater utility bill is not justification for nonpayment. The property owner, as identified from public land records of the appropriate county, shall be obligated to pay the appropriate stormwater user fee charge for that property. 
A.  Billing. 
(1)  A bill for stormwater user fee charges may be sent on city water bills through the United States postal service or by alternative means, notifying the owner of the property being billed of the amount of the stormwater user fee charge, less credits, the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due. 
(2)  The stormwater user fee charge will be billed and collected as deemed most effective and efficient by ordinance of the city council. 
(3)  Frequency of the billing of stormwater user fee charges shall be specified by ordinance of the city council. 
(4)  Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each developed property subject to stormwater user fee charges shall be obligated to pay stormwater user fee charges and any interest on delinquent stormwater user fee charge payments. 
(5)  If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of improved property, the Auburn Stormwater Utility may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back billed period. 
B.  Delinquencies and collection. 
(1)  Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby. 
(2)  A late charge of ten percent of the amount due per year shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility user fee charge that becomes delinquent in accordance with applicable state law. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner. 
C.  Adjustments. 
(1)  The stormwater coordinator shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge. 
i.  If a customer believes their stormwater user fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the stormwater coordinator and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. 
ii.  Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide supplemental information to the stormwater coordinator including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the stormwater coordinator, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the adjustment request. 
iii.  Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the stormwater coordinator, the stormwater coordinator shall have thirty calendar days within which to render a written decision. if the stormwater coordinator fails to render a decision within thirty days, the adjustment request shall automatically be deemed denied, but said denial shall be subject to appeal to the zoning board of appeals as set forth in this article. Concurrent payment of any charges allocated to the property is not required as a condition precedent to this request for review. 
iv.  In considering an adjustment request, the stormwater coordinator shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater utility user fee charge for the property is correct. 
v.  The stormwater coordinator's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing. 
vi.  If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater bill. 
(Ord. No. 10-014, § 18.74.109, 9-2-10; Ord. No. 12-022, 1-3-13) 
18.14.100. - Appeals, hearings. 
A.  Appeals. An appeal to the zoning board of appeals may be taken by any property owner or customer aggrieved by any decision of the stormwater coordinator. The appeal shall be taken within thirty days of the decision of the stormwater coordinator by filing with the zoning board of appeals a notice of appeal in writing specifying the grounds thereof. Upon the filing of the notice of appeal, the stormwater coordinator shall forthwith transmit to the zoning board of appeals all documentation constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was taken. 
B.  Hearing. The zoning board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give written notice to the appellant at least ten days prior to the hearing date. The notice shall indicate the place, date and time of the hearing. The zoning board of appeals shall affirm, reverse, affirm in part, or reverse in part the decision of the stormwater coordinator after hearing the evidence. If the decision of the stormwater coordinator is reversed in whole or in part, resulting in a refund or credit due to the property owner, then such refund or credit shall be calculated retroactive to the date of the initial appeal. 
C.  The decision of the zoning board of appeals shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative action. Any person aggrieved or dissatisfied with the decision of the zoning board of appeals may appeal that decision to the superior court of Barrow County by writ of certiorari.

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 14-003, Exh. A., adopted Aug. 7, 2014, repealed Ch. 18.16, §§ 18.16.010-18.16.070, and enacted a new chapter as set out herein. Former Ch. 18.16 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. 07-005, § 1-7, adopted in 2006 and Ord. No. 09-027, adopted July 2, 2009. 

18.16.010 - General provisions. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation, and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
1.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
2.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
3.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
4.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
5.  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and 
6.  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation, and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
B.  Applicability. This ordinance shall be applicable to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Auburn. 
C.  Designation of Ordinance Administrator. The stormwater coordinator is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this chapter. 
D.  Basis for Establishing Areas of Special Flood Hazard, Areas of Future-Conditions Flood Hazard and Associated Floodplain Characteristics - Flood Area Maps and Studies. For the purposes of defining and determining "areas of special flood hazard," "areas of future-conditions flood hazard," "areas of shallow flooding," "base flood elevations," "floodplains," "floodways," "future-conditions flood elevations," "future-conditions floodplains," potential flood hazard or risk categories as shown on FIRM maps, and other terms used in this chapter, the following documents and sources may be used for such purposes and are adopted by reference thereto: 
1.  The Flood Insurance Study (FIS), with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto. 
2.  Other studies, which may be relied upon for the establishment of the base flood elevation or delineation of the base or one-percent (100-year) floodplain and flood-prone areas, including: 
a.  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to the City of Auburn; and 
b.  Any base flood study conducted by a licensed professional engineer which has been prepared utilizing FEMA approved methodology and approved by the City of Auburn. 
3.  Other studies, which may be relied upon for the establishment of the future-conditions flood elevation or delineation of the future-conditions floodplain and flood-prone areas, including: 
a.  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to the City of Auburn; and 
b.  Any future-conditions flood study conducted by a licensed professional engineer which has been prepared utilizing FEMA approved methodology approved by the City of Auburn. 
E.  Compatibility with Other Regulations. This ordinance is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, easement, covenant, deed restriction or other provision of law. The requirements of this chapter are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
F.  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this chapter shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this chapter. 
G.  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of Auburn or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

4.  Review and record the actual elevation in relation to mean sea level (or highest adjacent grade) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new and substantially improved structures; 
5.  Review and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea level to which any substantially improved structures have been floodproofed; 
6.  When floodproofing is utilized for a nonresidential structure, the stormwater coordinator shall review the design and operation/maintenance plan and obtain certification from a licensed professional engineer or architect; 
7.  Notify affected adjacent communities and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GA DNR) prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); 
8.  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (e.g. where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the stormwater coordinator shall make the necessary interpretation. Any person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this chapter. Where floodplain elevations have been defined, the floodplain shall be determined based on flood elevations rather than the area graphically delineated on the floodplain maps; 
9.  All records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter shall be maintained in the office of the stormwater coordinator and shall be open for public inspection; 
10.  Coordinate all FIRM revisions with the GA DNR and FEMA; and

18.16.040 - Standards for development. 
A.  Definition of floodplain boundaries. 
1.  Studied "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available. 
2.  For all streams with a drainage area of one hundred acres or greater, the future-conditions flood elevations shall be provided by the City of Auburn. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the City of Auburn, then it shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Auburn. 
B.  Definition of Floodway Boundaries. The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of one hundred acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the City of Auburn. If floodway data is not available from the City of Auburn, it shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Auburn. 
C.  General Standards. 
1.  No development shall be allowed within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard that could result in any of the following: 
a.  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
b.  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
c.  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or 
d.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
2.  Any development within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard allowed under Section 18.16.040 C.1. shall also meet the following conditions: 
a.  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
b.  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
c.  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
d.  Verification of no-rise conditions (less than 0.01 foot), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of Section 18.16.040 D.; 
e.  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters; and 
f.  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the City of Auburn using the FEMA Community Concurrence forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of development, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys and plans for a final letter of map revision (LOMR). 
D.  Engineering Study Requirements for Floodplain Encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the City of Auburn prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
1.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
2.  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the City of Auburn. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
3.  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every one hundred feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
4.  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
E.  Floodway Encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in (2) below. 
2.  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
3.  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the City of Auburn until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the City of Auburn. 
F.  Maintenance Requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is maintained. The City of Auburn may direct the property owner (at no cost to the city) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the city.

(Ord. No. 14-003, Exh. A, 8-7-14) 
18.16.060 - Variance procedures. 
    The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. 
1.  Requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the city. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the City of Auburn. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
2.  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the City of Auburn shall have the right to appeal such decision to the zoning board of appeals as established by the City of Auburn in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
3.  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the zoning board of appeals may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Barrow County by writ of certiorari. 
4.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
5.  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
6.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
7.  In reviewing such requests, the City of Auburn and zoning board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
8.  Conditions for Variances: 
a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
(i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
b.  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as twenty-five dollars for each one hundred dollars of insurance coverage provided. 
d.  The stormwater coordinator shall maintain the records of all variance actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
9.  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the City of Auburn and zoning board of appeals shall deem necessary for the consideration of the request. 
10.  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the City of Auburn and the zoning board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this chapter. 
11.  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact." 
(Ord. No. 14-003, Exh. A, 8-7-14) 
18.16.070 - Violations, enforcement and penalties. 
    Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this chapter or the requirements of an approved stormwater management plan or permit, may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section. Any such action or inaction which is continuous with respect to time is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of any of the penalties described below shall not prevent such equitable relief. 
A.  Notice of Violation. If the city determines that an applicant or other responsible person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit, an approved stormwater management plan or the provisions of this chapter, it shall issue a written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible person.

A suspended, revoked or modified permit may be reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated (upon such conditions as the city may deem necessary) to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violations. 
4.  Civil Penalties. In the event the applicant or other responsible person fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within ten days, or such greater period as the City of Auburn shall deem appropriate (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, twenty-four hours notice shall be sufficient) after the City of Auburn has taken one or more of the actions described above, the City of Auburn may impose a penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars (depending on the severity of the violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt of the notice of violation. 
5.  Criminal Penalties. For intentional and flagrant violations of this chapter, the City of Auburn may issue a citation to the applicant or other responsible person, requiring such person to appear in Municipal Court to answer charges for such violation. Upon conviction, such person shall be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars or imprisonment for sixty days or both. Each act of violation and each day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense.
