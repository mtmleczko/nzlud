laws of the State of Iowa and of the City of Camanche to discover any information relevant to the
rate regulation proceeding, including, but not limited to, subpoena, interrogatories, production of
documents and deposition.

6-7-3 PLATTING REQUIRED, COUNCIL APPROVAL REQUIRED.
1. Plat Required. It is unlawful for any owner, agent or person having control of any land
within the corporate limits of the City or within two (2) miles of its corporate limits to subdivide or
lay out such land into blocks, lots, streets, avenues, alleys, public ways and grounds unless by plat in
accordance with the laws of the State of Iowa and the provisions of this chapter. A development or
subdivision solely for agricultural purposes, i.e., farming, is excluded from this requirement. The
Council may, by resolution, waive its right to review subdivisions located within two (2) miles of its
corporate limit. In order to secure approval of a proposed subdivision, the owner and subdivider
shall submit to the City plats and other information as required by this chapter. The owner and
subdivider of any subdivision shall comply with the requirement for a preliminary plat and the
requirements for a final plat.
207
2. Planning Consultation; Factors for Consideration.
a. In order to make the most of the opportunities related to the subdivision and to conserve
time, effort and expense, the owner or subdivider should consult with the commission, the city
engineer and other public officials prior to the preparation of the tentative plan of the subdivision
The comprehensive plan should be reviewed to determine how the proposed plan will fit into the
comprehensive plan.
b. Requirements of the street plan; school and recreational sites; shopping centers,
community facilities; sanitation; water supply, drainage and erosion; and, relationship to other
developments, existing and proposed in the vicinity, should be determined in advance of the
preparation of the subdivision plan. Consultation should also be held with those familiar with the
economic factors affecting the subdivision. A thorough estimate of the situation will result in sound
decisions with respect to the form, character and extent of the proposed subdivision.
c. No land shall be subdivided for residential use unless adequate access to the land over
improved streets or thoroughfares exists or will be considered by the commission to be unsuitable for
each such use by reason of flooding or improper drainage, objectionable earth and rock formation,
topography or any other feature harmful to the health and safety of possible residents and the
community as a whole.
3. Variances; Basis for Consideration; Justification.
a. Where the subdivider can show that a provision of this chapter would cause
unnecessary hardship if strictly adhered to and where, in the opinion of the Planning and Zoning,
because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site or density, a departure may be made
without destroying the intent of such provision, then the Planning and Zoning, may authorize a
variance. Any variance recommended by the Planning and Zoning, is required to be entered in
writing in the minutes of the Planning and Zoning, and the reasoning on which the departure was
justified shall be set forth.
4. Failure to Comply with Chapter; Building Permits; Exceptions. The building inspector
shall not issue building, repair, temporary occupancy or permanent occupancy permits for any
structure located on a lot in any subdivision within the city, the plat of which has not been approved

6-13-1 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE
1. The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 364, Code of Iowa, as amended,
delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and perform any function it deems appropriate to
protect and preserve the rights, privileges and property of the city or of its residents, and to preserve
and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and convenience of its residents.
2. Findings of Fact
a. The flood hazard areas of the City of Camanche are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare
of the community.
b. These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by: (i) The
occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create hazardous
conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flooding and (ii)
the cumulative effect of obstructions on the flood plain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
3. Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this ordinance to protect and preserve the rights, privileges and property of the
City of Camanche and its residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare,
and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in Section
IB1 with provisions designed to:
a. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of
flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities.
259
b. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such
uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial
improvement.
c. Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for intended purposes
because of flood hazard.
d. Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to
purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. 719, Passed 2012)
6-13-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS
1. Lands to Which Ordinance Apply. The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to all lands
and uses which have significant flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Clinton
County and Incorporated Areas, City of Camanche, Panel 19045C0483D, 0484D, 0487D, 0489,
0491D, 0492D, 0493D, 049D, 0511D, 0513D, dated July 18, 2011, which were prepared as part of
the Clinton County Flood Insurance Study, shall be used to identify such flood hazard areas and all
areas shown thereon to be within the boundaries of the 100-year flood shall be considered as having
significant flood hazards. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the precise location of the 100-
year flood boundary, the location shall be determined on the basis of the 100-year flood elevation at
the particular site in question. The Flood Insurance Study for Clinton County is hereby adopted by
reference and is made a part of this Ordinance for the purpose of administering floodplain
management regulations.
2. Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of the Special Flood
Hazard areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the official Flood Insurance Rate Map.
When an interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the Building Inspector shall
make the necessary interpretation.
3. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be located,
extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance
and other applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this ordinance.
4. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this ordinance to repeal,
abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this ordinance shall prevail. All other
ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency
only.
5. Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance shall
be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body
and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
260
6. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this ordinance are
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This ordinance does not imply that areas outside the
designated special flood hazard areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Camanche or any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
7. Severability. If a court of competent jurisdiction adjudges any section, clause, provision or
portion of this ordinance unconstitutional or invalid, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be
affected thereby.
(Ord. 719, Passed 2012)
6-13-3 FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS
1. General Flood Plain Standards. All uses must be consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage and meet the following applicable performance standards. Development which
involves the placement of structures, factory built homes, fill or other obstructions, storage of
materials or equipment, excavation or alteration of a watercourse shall be reviewed by the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources to determine whether the land involved is either wholly or
partly within the floodway or floodway fringe. Where 100-year flood elevation data has not
been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be
contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing the Department
of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
a. All development within the areas of significant flood hazard shall:
(1) Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
(2) Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage.
(3) Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant to flood
damage.
(4) Obtain all other necessary permits from federal, state and local governmental
agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
b. Residential buildings. All new or substantially improved residential structures shall
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-year
flood level. Construction shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than 1.0
ft. above the 100-year flood level and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the limits of
any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such as piers) may be allowed subject
to favorable consideration by the City Council, where existing topography, street grades, or other
factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must be adequate to support the
structure as well as withstand the various forces and hazards associated with flooding.
261
All new residential structures shall be provided with a means of access which will be passable by
wheeled vehicles during the 100-year flood.
c. Non-residential buildings. All new or substantially improved non-residential buildings
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-
year flood level, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a
level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall
certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures,
velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 100-year flood; and that the
structure, below the 100-year flood level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to North
AmericanVertical Datum) to which any structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the
Building Inspector.
d. All new and substantially improved structures:
(1) Fully enclosed areas below the "lowest floor" (not including basements) that are
subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must
either be certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
(a) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
(b) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
(c ) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings
or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and low damage potential
storage.
(2) New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or modified) and
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
(3) New and substantially improved structures must be constructed with electrical,
heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are
designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components
during conditions of flooding.
262
e. Factory-built homes:
(1) All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing factory-built home
parks or subdivisions, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor
of the structure is a minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-year flood level.
(2) All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing factory-built home
parks or subdivisions, shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods
of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
f. Utility and Sanitary Systems:
(1) On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or designed to
avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system during flooding.
(2) All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well as the discharge of effluent into flood
waters. Wastewater treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of
flood protection equal to or greater than one (1) foot above the 100-year flood elevation.
(3) New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water supply treatment facilities (other than
on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of protection equal to or greater than one (1) foot
above the 100-year flood elevation.
(4) Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk associated with such flood damaged
or impaired systems.
g. Storage of materials and equipment that are flammable, explosive or injurious to
human, animal or plant life is prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-
year flood level. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or (i) not be subject
to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due to flood waters or (ii) be readily
removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
h. Flood control structural works such as levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a
minimum, protection from a 100-year flood with a minimum of 3 ft. of design freeboard and shall
provide for adequate interior drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources shall
approve structural flood control works.
i. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be designed to maintain the flood
carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion. In addition, the Department of Natural
Resources must approve such alterations or relocations.
263
j. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and subdivisions) shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage. Development associated with subdivision proposals (including
the installation of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this Ordinance.

following:
(1) Review all flood plain development permit applications to assure that the
provisions of this ordinance will be satisfied.
(2) Review flood plain development applications to assure that all necessary permits
have been obtained from federal, state and local governmental agencies including approval when
required from the Department of Natural Resources for flood plain construction.
(3) Record and maintain a record of the elevation (in relation to North American
Vertical Datum) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved
structures in the special flood hazard area.
(4) Record and maintain a record of the elevation (in relation to North American
Vertical datum) to which all new or substantially improved structures have been floodproofed.
(5) Notify adjacent communities/counties and the Department of Natural Resources
prior to any proposed alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of such
notifications to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
266
(6) Keep a record of all permits, appeals and such other transactions and
correspondence pertaining to the administration of this ordinance.
2. Flood Plain Development Permit
a. Permit Required - A Flood Plain Development Permit issued by the Administrator
shall be secured prior to any flood plain development (any man-made change to improved and
unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, filling,
grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations), including the placement of factory-built homes.
b. Application for Permit - Application shall be made on forms furnished by the
Administrator and shall include the following:
(1) Description of the work to be covered by the permit for which application is to be
made.
(2) Description of the land on which the proposed work is to be done (i.e., lot, block,
track, street address or similar description) that will readily identify and locate the work to be done.
(3) Indication of the use or occupancy for which the proposed work is intended.
(4) Elevation of the 100-year flood.
(5) Elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum) of the lowest floor
(including basement) of buildings or of the level to which a building is to be floodproofed.
(6) For buildings being improved or rebuilt, the estimated cost of improvements and
market value of the building prior to the improvements.
(7) Such other information as the Administrator deems reasonably necessary for the
purpose of this ordinance.
c. Action on Permit Application - The Administrator shall, within a reasonable time,
make a determination as to whether the proposed flood plain development meets the applicable
standards of this ordinance and shall approve or disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the
applicant shall be informed, in writing, of the specific reasons therefore. The Administrator shall not
issue permits for variances except as directed by the City Council.
d. Construction and Use to be as Provided in Application and Plans - Flood Plain
Development Permits based on the basis of approved plans and applications authorize only the use,
arrangement, and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications and no other use,
arrangement or construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized
shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance. The applicant shall be required to submit certification
by a professional engineer or land surveyor, as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the
267
finished fill, building floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures were
accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance, prior to the use or occupancy of
any structure.
3. Variance
a. The City Council may authorize upon request in specific cases such variances from
the terms of this ordinance that will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
(1) Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause,
(ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of the variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances,
cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances.
(2) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in
flood levels during the 100-year flood would result. Consideration of the effects of any
development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal degree of development
would be allowed for similarly situated lands.
(3) Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(4) In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection for
buildings than what is ordinarily required by this Ordinance, the applicant shall be notified in writing
over the signature of the Administrator that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and
(ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
b. Factors Upon Which the Decision of the City Council Shall be Based - In passing
upon applications for Variances, the Board shall consider all relevant factors specified in other
sections of this ordinance and:
(1) The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused
by encroachments.
(2) The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream to the
injury of others.
(3) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these
systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
268
(4) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and
the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
(5) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the City.
(6) The requirements of the facility for a flood plain location.
(7) The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed
use.
(8) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
(9) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain
management program for the area.
(10) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of
the flood water expected at the site.
(12) Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this ordinance.
c. Conditions Attached to Variances - Upon consideration of the factors listed above, the
Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purpose of this ordinance. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
(1) Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
(2) Limitation of periods of use and operation.
(3) Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
(4) Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees and other
protective measures, provided such are approved by the Department of Natural Resources and are
deemed the only practical alternative to achieving the purpose of this ordinance.
(5) Floodproofing measures.
