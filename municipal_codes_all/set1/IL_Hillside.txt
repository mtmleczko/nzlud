PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Hillside, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1965 Code, as supplemented through November 25, 2002, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the village board. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1965 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Supervising Editor, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

(b)  Payment to retiring employee for unused time. Upon retirement, there shall be paid to the retiring employee, in addition to any other sums due him, an amount to be computed at the retiring employee's then per diem base salary rate for each unused vacation day and for each earned but unallocated vacation day which shall be determined by multiplying a fraction, where the number of full months the retiring employee is employed in his final calendar year is the numerator and where "12" is the denominator, by the number of annual vacation days to which the retiring employee would be entitled, based on his years of service at retirement and the first schedule contained in subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  Scheduling generally. The scheduling of vacations within each department will be done by the person in charge of the department after full consideration of the seniority status of each employee and their individual choices of vacation period; provided, however, that no more than two calendar weeks of vacation shall be scheduled between April 1 and October 1 for any one employee until two calendar weeks of vacation shall have been scheduled for all other employees of the particular department, whereupon, based on seniority status and individual choices, the remaining vacation time of each employee will be scheduled by the person in charge of the department.

(3)  The chief of police may establish any other regulations governing the scheduling of vacation periods for employees of the police department not in conflict with this section. 
(Code 1965, § 8.116) 
Sec. 2-138. - Employee absences. 
(a)  Sick leave. 
(1)  Sick leave, with full pay, will be granted to all permanent full-time employees at the rate of one day for each full month of service, except for the rate of one day for each two full months of service applicable to firefighters assigned to 24-hour shifts. Sick leave may be accumulated up to a maximum of 60 days, except for a maximum of 30 days applicable to firefighters assigned to 24-hour shifts. Sick leave will continue to accrue during any period in which the employee is on approved sick leave status. Sick leave shall not be considered as a privilege which an employee may use at his discretion, but shall be allowed, subject to all other provisions of this section, only in case of actual sickness of an employee which prevents his performance of duties, or because of illness in his immediate family as hereinafter provided, or to take physical examinations or other sickness prevention measures prescribed by a practicing physician. Sick leave which would otherwise accrue during each calendar year, commencing on January 1 following the first anniversary of employment, may be drawn in advance during said calendar year; provided, however, that in the event the employment is terminated during said calendar year, the gross salary for any sick leave days so drawn in advance which would otherwise have accrued following termination shall be deducted from said employee's final compensation. In addition to the foregoing any permanent full-time employee, who shall have accumulated the maximum number of sick leave days, shall in lieu of additional sick leave days be entitled to accumulate bonus leave days at the same rate of accrual as provided hereinabove for sick leave, to a maximum of 12 such bonus leave days in any given calendar year except as to firefighters who are assigned to 24-hour shifts and who shall be entitled to a maximum accrual of six such bonus leave days in any given calendar year. If an employee has accumulated bonus leave days in a calendar year and subsequently must be out on sick leave during that same year, he must first use accumulated bonus leave days as sick days and not until such bonus leave days are exhausted shall the employee begin to use regular sick days. If, on December 31, an employee has accumulated accrued bonus leave days, then those days may be used as days off, not necessarily related to illness, during the following calendar year, subject to scheduling at the request of the employee and with the discretionary approval of the person in charge of the particular employee's department, not later than February 15 of such following year. Any such bonus leave days not so scheduled to be used during such following year may not be thereafter carried forward but instead the employee shall be paid, not later than March 15 of such following year, an amount equal to the employees then per diem base salary rate for each such unscheduled bonus leave day. Upon retirement, the employee will receive compensation at 100 percent for all his accumulated sick days, if he has accrued 54 or more sick days. If he has accrued less than 54 sick days, he will receive compensation for the accrued sick days equal to 50 percent of the full amount of each sick day. Firefighter/paramedics who are assigned to 24-hour shifts will receive compensation at 100 percent for all his accumulated sick days, if he has accrued 27 or more sick days. If he has accrued less then 27 sick days, he will receive compensation for the accrued sick days equal to 50 percent of the full amount of each sick day. 
(2)  To receive compensation while absent on sick leave, the employee shall notify his department head, and/or supervisor in charge, at least one-half hour prior to the time set for his regular scheduled working hours. An employee absent for at least three full consecutive working days shall present to his department head, prior to his return to duty, a medical certificate from his attending physician and, if required by the village board, from a practicing physician or clinic designated by and at the expense of the village board. The employee may be removed from the payroll if the absence for sickness continues beyond the number of sick leave days accumulated by such employee. In the case of very serious or prolonged illness, an employee, with the approval of his department head and the village board of trustees, may, however, use all accumulated vacation time in addition to his accumulated sick leave before he shall be removed from the village payroll. 
(3)  As a condition of the granting of sick leave benefits, the village board or the respective department head may require an employee to file, from time to time, a certificate of health examination and a report from a practicing physician or clinic designated by the village board. The village board or the respective department head may require the employee to conform to any medical advice contained in such report as a condition of continuing employment with the village. 
(4)  If in the judgment of the village board an employee is unfit to perform his duties because of his physical condition, the village board may require the employee to take sick leave sufficient to improve his condition to a point where he would again be capable of performing his duties. 
(5)  An employee on sick leave, who is absent from his home at the time of a visit from his department head, a person designated by his department head to make such visit, or by a member of the village board, will have all sick leave benefits for the particular illness cancelled and the time lost will not be restored to the accumulated sick leave credit of the employee, unless at the time of the visit the employee is confined to a hospital, is receiving medical attention or is absent for other reasons acceptable to the village board. An offense of this type will be sufficient cause for dismissal. 
(6)  The department head will maintain a record of all credits and debits to the sick leave account of each employee in his department. These sick leave accounts are to be available for inspection by the employee and a monthly report shall be filed with the payroll clerk and village board. 
(7)  Any total temporary disability benefit checks received by the employee from the village's workmen's compensation insurance carrier for any number of working days which exceed the employee's accumulated sick leave time shall be endorsed over to the village or, in the alternative, the village shall deduct the aggregate amount of such benefit checks for the excess period from the salary otherwise due the employee. Any such benefit checks received by the employee, whether or not in excess of the accumulated sick leave time, may be retained by the employee for any period during which the employee is not receiving regular salary or sick leave pay from the village. 
(8)  Notwithstanding any provision in this section to the contrary, whenever any full-time police officer or firefighter shall suffer any injury in the line of duty which causes him to be unable to perform his duties, he shall continue to be paid by the village for not longer than one year in relation to the same injury on the same basis as he was paid before the injury, with no deduction from his sick leave credits, compensatory time for overtime accumulations or vacations, or service credits in the police officers' or firefighters' pension funds during the time he is unable to perform his duties due to the result of the injury. At any time during the period for which such compensation shall continue to accrue, the village board may order, at its expense, a physical or medical examination of the injured person to determine the degree of disability. The village board shall make the determination as to whether the injured person is unable to perform his duties, taking into consideration all medical and physical examination reports, including workmen's compensation documentation, available to the village board. During this period of disability, the injured person shall not be employed in any other manner with or without monetary compensation. If such person is so employed contrary to this prohibition, he shall thereby forfeit the continuing compensation provided by this section. Any disabled person receiving such continuing compensation shall not be entitled to any benefits for which he would otherwise qualify because of his disability under the provisions of the Illinois Pension Code approved March 18, 1963, as amended before or hereafter. 
(9)  Notwithstanding any provision in this section other than subsection (a)(8) to the contrary, sick leave compensation will not be paid to any employee for any absence from duty on any day immediately before or after such employee's regular, personal or vacation day off; however, such exclusion shall not apply to any full-time firefighter on any day immediately before or after his regular day off. 
(b)  Funeral leave. In the event of death in the immediate family (defined as the employee's legal spouse, children, parents, parents of spouse, brother, sister, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandparents and grandchildren), an employee shall be granted up to three consecutive workdays as funeral leave if the employee attends the funeral. In the event of death of an employee's brother-in-law, sister-in-law, or legal spouse's grandparents or grandchildren, an employee shall be granted up to one workday as funeral leave if the employee attends the funeral. An employee if requested may be required to provide satisfactory evidence of the death of a member of the immediate family. 
(c)  Family medical leave. An employee shall be covered by the Family Medical Lave Act of 1993 and therefore, shall be eligible, in accordance with the Act and the regulations thereunder, for up to 12 weeks of leave per year for the birth, adoption or foster care of a child, or a serious injury or illness of the employee or the employee's immediate family. An employee utilizing such leave must provide such notice as is required by the Act. Employees shall suffer no loss of benefits while on such leave and the employee may use any accrued paid time off option in any order, including sick time. However, when choosing to utilize FMLA for immediate family, the employee must exhaust time due, then vacation, then personal days and finally sick time.

(Code 1965, § 8.703) 
Sec. 2-489. - Debt policies. 
(a)  This policy establishes guidelines for use of debt financing that will allow the village to minimize financing costs and retain or improve its bond rating from Moody's Investors Services (or an equivalent rating from a similar firm). 
(b)  Conditions under which the village may consider use of debt financing. The village may consider the use of debt financing when all of the following conditions apply: 
(1)  For one-time capital improvement projects and unusual equipment purchases; 
(2)  When the project's useful life, or the projected service life of the equipment, will exceed the term of financing; and 
(3)  Then the Village has identified revenues sufficient to service the debt, either from existing revenues or increased taxes or fees. 
The village will not use debt for any recurring purpose such as current operating and infrastructure maintenance expenditures, nor will the village use short-term debt, unless under exigent circumstances. 
(c)  The village will use the following criteria to evaluate pay-as-you-go financing versus debt financing in funding capital improvements: 
(1)  Factors that favor pay-as-you-go financing. 
a.  Current revenues and/or adequate fund balances are available to finance the project. 
b.  Project phasing could allow the village to finance the project over time without debt. 
c.  Additional debt would adversely affect the village credit rating. 
d.  Market conditions are unstable or the project presents marketing difficulties. 
(2)  Factors that favor debt financing. 
a.  Revenues available for debt service are sufficient and reliable. 
b.  Issuance of debt will not jeopardize the village's credit rating. 
c.  Market conditions present favorable interest rates and good demand for municipal financing. 
d.  A project is mandated by state or federal requirements and current revenues and fund balances are insufficient to pay project costs. 
e.  A project is immediately required to meet or relieve infrastructure capacity needs, and current revenues and fund balances are not sufficient to finance the project 
f.  The life of the project or asset financed is ten years or longer. 
(Ord. No. 07-11, § 1, 3-26-2007) 
Sec. 2-490. - Debt issuance guidelines. 
(a)  Considerations in issuing general obligation (G.O.) or revenue bonds. When the village has the option of using G.O. or revenue bonds, the village will consider the benefits of reduced debt expense and flexibility achievable through G.O. debt versus reserving the village's G.O. debt capacity by issuing revenue debt. The village may use General Obligation bonds in lieu of revenue bonds if debt expense can be significantly reduced (as compared to financing with revenue debt) and if a special or enterprise fund revenue is sufficient and reliable to fund debt service costs. In such cases, the village board of trustees will adopt ordinances abating the debt tax levies and direct staff to pay debt service costs with alternative revenues. 
(b)  Credit enhancements. The village will seek credit enhancements such as letters of credit or insurance when necessary for marketing purposes or to make the financing most cost-effective. 
(c)  Debt structure guidelines. 
(1)  In general, the village will maintain a debt structure under which 50 percent of the outstanding principal will be repaid within ten years. 
(2)  The term of financing (final bond maturity) will not exceed the expected useful life of the project or equipment financed with the debt. 
(3)  If the village plans to pay debt service expenses from a specific revenue source, the village will use conservative assumptions in its revenue projections. 
(d)  Professional services. To provide assistance in debt issuance, the village will select a financial advisor and/or investment banker and bond counsel on a competitive basis; these advisors will be retained for several years to provide continuity and allow them to develop an understanding of the village's needs. 
(e)  Competitive versus negotiated debt issuance. The village will generally conduct financing on a competitive basis; however, negotiated financing may be used where market volatility or the use of an unusual or complex financing or security structure causes a concern with regard to marketability. 
(f)  Inter-fund loans. The village may use inter-fund loans (in lieu or borrowing from private parties) to minimize the expense and administrative effort associated with external borrowing. Inter-fund loans are typically made for relatively short periods of time (under five years) and relatively low amounts (under $3,000, 000.00). Inter-fund loans will be considered to finance high priority needs on a case-by-case basis, only when other planned expenditures in the fund making the loan would not be affected. 
(g)  Maintenance of specific credit ratings. 
(1)  The village will seek to maintain or improve its current bond rating and will specifically discuss with the village board of trustees any proposal which might cause that rating to be lowered. 
(2)  An analysis will be prepared by village staff for each proposed financing; such analysis will assess the impact of debt issuance on current and future operating and capital budgets and address the reliability of revenues to support debt service payments. 
(Ord. No. 07-11, § 1, 3-26-2007) 
Sec. 2-491. - Debt capacity guidelines or general obligation debt. 
(a)  Direct debt. To maintain its sound fiscal condition and debt rating, the village will limit the amount of debt it will issue and its annual debt service expenses in accordance with state statute. 
(b)  Computation of legal debt margin. 
(1)  Statutory debt limitation is 8.625% of the village's assessed valuation. 
(2)  The legal debt margin (debt that the village may issue) is the statutory debt limit less all present applicable debt. 
(c)  Overlapping debt. The village will monitor levels of overlapping debt and communicate debt plans with public entities that may issue overlapping debt. The village will take into account overlapping debt in considering both the amount of debt that the Village will issue, and the timing or village bond issues. 
(Ord. No. 07-11, § 1, 3-26-2007) 
Sec. 2-492. - Debt administration. 
(a)  Financial disclosure. The village will follow a policy of full disclosure on every financial report and bond prospectus (Official Statement), voluntarily following disclosure guidelines provided by the Government Finance Officers Association unless the cost of compliance with the higher standard is unreasonable. 
(b)  Monitoring outstanding debt. 
(1)  The village will monitor all forms of debt annually and include an analysis in the village's financial plan; concerns and recommended remedies will be reported to the village board of trustees as necessary. 
(2)  The village will monitor bond covenants and federal regulations concerning debt, and adhere to those covenants and regulations at all times. 
(3)  Investment of bond proceeds. The village will invest bonds proceeds in accordance with the village's adopted investment policy and federal arbitrage regulations. 
(Ord. No. 07-11, § 1, 3-26-2007) 
Sec. 2-493. - Responsible bidding for contracts. 
(a)  The recitals of the ordinance from which this ordinance derives are hereby adopted as findings of fact as if said recitals were fully set forth in this section. 
(b)  Financial responsibility is an important factor in determining the "lowest responsible bidder," and the village, through its contracting authority, shall require an entity that bids on a public contract produce satisfactory evidence of the following: 
(1)  That the business entity is properly registered and authorized to conduct the type of work to be performed, including evidence that demonstrates that the entity possesses or complies with requirements of the Internal Revenue Service (evidence of federal employer tax identification number - EIN), Illinois Departments of Revenue and/or Registration, and Illinois Department of Employment Security registration requirements, as well as complying with the general business license requirements of the village prior to the award and during the term of the contract; 
(2)  That the business entity is in compliance with all federal, state and village equal employment opportunity requirements; 
(3)  That the business entity has evidence of all specified insurance coverages; 
(4)  That the business entity complies with all provisions of the Illinois Prevailing Wage Act, including evidence that the business entity provides or participates in a medical hospitalization program for its employees, has a pension or retirement benefit program for its employees, with the premium or cost or contribution rate, as well as benefit configuration for each of the respective aforementioned programs, being no less than required under the Illinois Prevailing Wage Act; 
(5)  That the business entity has an apprenticeship and training program approved and registered with the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training; 
(6)  That the business entity complies with any other additional requirements the village may find beneficial. 
(c)  The contracting authority, in order to make its determination as to whether the bidding entity is a "responsible bidder," shall confirm and substantiate that the contract awardee can be reasonably be expected to complete and perform under the contract specifications, and the contracting authority may require the successful bidder to post a bid, performance, wage/fringe benefit and/or material bond(s). The contracting authority shall also determine if the successful bidder can reasonably be expected to complete the project within the time constraints as delineated in the request for bids and/or proposals. The contracting authority shall also determine if the bidding entity maintains a satisfactory level of past performance and integrity as well as possesses the financial, supervisory, personnel, material, equipment, and other resources and expertise to satisfactorily meet its contractual responsibilities and obligations. 
(d)  Social responsibility is a concern in awarding public contracts, and the contracting authority may factor in its determination of whether a bidder is "responsible" such factors as bidder's record of conformity with environmental, labor, and health and safety laws including compliance with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Furthermore, the bidder shall be required to provide a certificate of insurance, designating the village as an additional insured under all pertinent policies, specifying all required coverages, including general liability, workers' compensation, completed operations, automobile, hazardous occupation, product liability, and professional liability at such limits as the contracting authority deems appropriate to protect the interests of the village.

The program administrator will be responsible for the program administration, for ensuring appropriate training of village staff on the program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances and considering periodic changes to the program. 
(b)  Staff training and reports. Village staff responsible for implementing the program shall be trained either by or under the direction of the program administrator in the detection of red flags, and the responsive steps to be taken when a red flag is detected. Further training shall also be provided on a yearly basis or as needed to address changes in the program. 
(c)  Service provider arrangements. In the event the village engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more covered accounts, the village will take the following steps to ensure the service provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. 
(1)  Require, by contract, that service providers have such policies and procedures in place; and 
(2)  Require, by contract, that service providers review the village's program and report any red flags to the program administrator. 
(d)  Specific program elements and confidentiality. For the effectiveness of identity theft prevention programs, the red flag rule envisions a degree of confidentiality regarding the village's specific practices relating to identity theft detection, prevention and mitigation. Therefore, under this program, knowledge of such specific practices is to be limited to the program administrator or identity theft committee and those employees who need to know them for purposes of preventing identity theft. Because this program is to be adopted by a public body and thus publicly available, it would be counterproductive to list these specific practices here. Therefore, only the program's general red flag detection, implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document.

DIVISION 2. - PROTECTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS 

Sec. 2-601. - Introduction. 
    This identity-protection policy is adopted pursuant to the Illinois Identity Protection Act, 5 ILCS 179/1 et seq. The Identity Protection Act requires the village to draft, approve, and implement this identity-protection policy to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of Social Security numbers that the village collects, maintains, and uses. It is important to safeguard Social Security numbers against unauthorized access because Social Security numbers can be used to facilitate identity theft. One way to better protect Social Security numbers is to limit the widespread dissemination of those numbers. The Identity Protection Act was passed in part to require the village and other local and state government agencies to assess their personal information collection practices and make necessary changes to those practices to ensure confidentiality. All village officers, employees, and agents shall comply with the Identity Protection Act and this identity-protection policy at all times.

(a)  No parcel of property which is improved with a building or structure having a sanitary sewer connection, direct or indirect, to the sanitary sewer system operated and maintained by the village shall be sold unless and until a certificate of compliance shall have been issued by the village. The certificate will evidence that the stormwater discharge from sump pumps, downspouts and roof drains is in compliance with this article or, in the alternative, that adequate financial arrangements have been made to guarantee performance of all necessary correction work in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c)(3) of this section. 
(b)  Each owner of any parcel of property subject to the provisions of this section shall notify in writing the village building inspector, directly or through the owner's agent or broker, of the impending sale of such parcel within five business days after a contract of sale shall have been executed by the seller and purchaser. Prior to closing of the sales transaction, it shall be the owner's obligation to make application for such certificate of compliance to the village building inspector on such form as he or she may prescribe. The filing of such application within the five business day period will also satisfy the owner's obligation to notify the village building inspector of the impending sale as otherwise required under this subsection. 
(c)  No certificate of compliance shall be issued unless and until the following standards have been met: 
(1)  The building or structure subject to the provisions of this section shall have been inspected under the supervision of the village building inspector for compliance with all requirements under this article pertaining to stormwater discharge from sump pumps, downspouts and roof drains. 
(2)  A written report of the inspection shall have been prepared and a copy thereof furnished to the property owner, directly or through the owner's agent or broker. 
(3)  If the inspection report indicates a lack of compliance with any requirement under this article pertaining to stormwater discharge from sump pumps, downspouts and roof drains, then the owner shall have arranged for the correction work to be completed before the closing of the sales transaction. If the owner is unable to complete the work before the closing date, then a cost estimate of the work necessary to bring the building or structure into compliance shall have been prepared by a licensed plumber or sewer contractor in the form of an offer to perform the necessary work for a specified price. In that event, the owner must either deposit with a broker, attorney, bank, savings and loan association or trust company mutually acceptable to the seller and purchaser, as escrowee, a sum equal to the cost estimate, a true copy of which estimate and escrow agreement shall be filed with the village building inspector. In lieu of the escrow deposit, the owner may furnish a performance bond issued by a surety company licensed to do business in the state, naming the purchaser of the property as obligee in an amount equal to the cost estimate. The escrow agreement or the performance bond, as the case may be, shall require that the correction work be completed within 90 days from the date of issuance of the certificate of compliance. Failure to timely complete the correction work will be deemed a default of the escrow agreement or the performance bond and the certificate of compliance will become null and void, whereupon the purchaser of the property will become responsible for the completion of the correction work. 
(4)  There shall be on file with the village building inspector a written verification by the village clerk's office that a water meter reading has been made to determine the volume of water furnished to the parcel of property to be sold from the date of the prior reading through the date preceding the date of issuance of the certificate of compliance and that the water account as of that last meter reading date has been paid in full.

Any such contract shall also permit the village board or the village administrator to require pay telephones in the public way to have special features designed to reduce criminal activity. In addition, the contract must provide that the village administrator must be notified of the location of any pay telephone that is to be situated in the public way in his village pursuant to this section.

(f)  The village board may at any time after January 1, 1997, or at any time after the effective date of this article, if pursuant to a contract under this article, by ordinance order the removal of a particular pay telephone that is in the public way. Such an ordinance must identify the location of the telephone to be removed. Any pay telephone that is not removed within 14 days after an ordinance ordering its removal is adopted shall be subject to immediate removal at the owner's expense by the village.

Sec. 22-822. - Outdoor pay telephones. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, no person shall install or maintain any telephone booth, mounted telephone, or other form of pay telephone not enclosed within the interior of a building unless it is located on the public way and in accordance with this article. Any outdoor pay telephone located on property other than the public way in violation of this article shall be removed by its owner, any person with control over the pay phone, or the owner of real estate on which the pay phone is locate d, within 30 days after the effective date of this section. 
(b)  If any outdoor pay telephone is installed in violation of this article at substantially the same location where a telephone was previously removed pursuant to this article, any person participating in the violation shall be subject to punishment as provided in section 1-10 of this Code. Each day that a violation of subsection (a) of this section continues shall constitute a separate offense. However, for the period ending six months after the effective date of this amendatory ordinance, no fine shall be imposed with respect to a telephone unless a removal notice has been posted on the telephone pursuant to this section. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the village administrator may issue a revocable certificate of registration jointly authorizing the owner of real property on which a telephone is to be located and a telecommunications company that will operate the telephone, subject to the conditions of this article, the installation or maintenance of a telephone booth, mounted telephone, or other form of pay telephone not enclosed within the interior of a building and not on the public way, but permitted by this subsection (c). The certification of registration shall create no legal rights or entitlements, and shall not be deemed to create any type of vested interest. The application for the certificate of registration shall designate a registered agent for receiving notices under this section. Applications shall be maintained by the village as confidential business records. The certification shall be issued no later than 30 days after a complete application for an eligible location is received. No certificate of registration shall authorize installation of a telephone at a location that the village administrator determines will not be in the public interest or may have a deleterious impact on the surrounding neighborhood. The village administrator may issue a certificate of registration pursuant to this section for no more than two telephones on any zoning lot of property; provided that the number of telephones authorized under this section for any parking lot with 200 or more parking spaces, or for any property on which there are facilities designed for public assembly and having a capacity for more than 10,000 persons, shall not exceed a number determined by the village administrator by rule as necessary for public convenience. No certificate of registration shall authorize a telephone situated: (i) on vacant property; (ii) on property on which there is situated an abandoned building; (iii) on property on which there is situated an establishment that has or requires a tavern license, or that is kept, used, maintained, advertised and held out to the public as a place that primarily sells alcoholic liquor at retail, or (iv) on property on which there is a building that is used primarily for residential purposes. Certificates of registration shall be issued for particular locations identified in the application therefor. The village administrator by rule may establish and impose an application fee or an annual registration fee, or both, for certificates or registration issued under this section. The total amount of the fees may not exceed an amount sufficient for the village to recover its costs in administering this section, exclusive of costs directly related to preliminary or final hearings. 
(d)  Whenever the village administrator determines that it is not in the public interest for the telephone to remain on private property, or that the telephone may have a deleterious impact on the surrounding neighborhood, the village administrator shall initiate procedures to revoke the certificate of registration for that telephone. A certification by the village administrator setting forth facts establishing that it is not in the public interest for the telephone to remain on private property, or that the telephone has a deleterious impact on the surrounding neighborhood, shall be prima facie evidence that the certificate of registration is subject to revocation or should not be issued under this section. Whenever the village administrator makes such a determination with respect to a telephone for which a certificate of registration has been issued, the village administrator shall attempt to notify the registrant of the determination by mailing a notice to the registered agent or the registrant, and a representative of the village may enter upon any private property and may place upon the telephone a notice stating that the certificate of registration is subject to revocation and that the registrant has a right to request a preliminary hearing at which the registrant will be give an opportunity to be heard in opposition to the revocation within seven days of the notice. The preliminary hearing shall be informal and shall provide the registrant with an opportunity to address the reasons for the village administrator's preliminary determination. If no preliminary hearing is requested or if the village administrator determines that there is probable cause for revocation of the certificate of registration after the preliminary hearing, the village administrator shall issue an order requiring the telephone and its appurtenances to be removed within seven days after the order is issued pending a final determination. Telephones that are not timely removed may be removed by a representative of the village. The owner of a telephone for which a determination of probable cause for revocation of a certification of registration has been issued may contest such determination timely removing the telephone and its appurtenances and by filing with the village administrator a request for a final hearing within 14 days after removal in accordance with rules promulgated with the administrator. If, after a final hearing, the administrator determines that it is not in the public interest for the telephone to be located on the private property, or that the telephone has a deleterious impact on the surrounding neighborhood, or if no timely request for a final hearing is made, the village administrator shall revoke the certification of registration for that telephone. No certificate of registration may be issued for a telephone at a zoning lot with respect to which a previous certificate has been revoked for a period of one year after revocation. At the preliminary and the final hearing, the formal or technical rules of evidence shall not apply. Evidence may be admitted if it is a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. The village administrator may establish and impose a fee for preliminary and final hearings conducted under this section. The total amount of the fees may not exceed an amount sufficient for the village to recover its costs directly related to the preliminary or final hearings. 
(e)  Outdoor pay telephones not lawfully installed or maintained pursuant to this Code are hereby declared to be public nuisances subject to summary abatement upon due notice. A representative of the village may enter upon any private property within the village that he has reason to believe contains an outdoor pay telephone in violation of this section, and may place upon the telephone a notice that the telephone must be removed within seven days. Such notice shall also provide that, if the telephone is not removed within seven days, a representative of the village may remove the telephone and charge the costs of removal jointly and severally to its owner, operator, and the person who owns or controls the real property on which the pay telephone is located. If such telephone has not been removed within seven days, a representative of the village may remove the telephone. 
(f)  If the costs to the village of removing telephones and their appurtenances pursuant to this section are not paid within 30 days, the telephone shall be deemed abandoned and may be sold or destroyed. The costs of removing outdoor pay telephones shall be a debt to the village jointly and severally owed by the telephone's owner and operator, and any person who owns or controls the real property on which the telephone was located.

ARTICLE V. - AUTOMATIC AND MANUAL BURGLAR, HOLD-UP AND FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS 

Sec. 30-121. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alarm equipment installer means any person, firm or corporation that sells, leases or installs alarm systems or signaling devices which transmit alarms upon receipt of a stimulus from a detection apparatus to a bell or a remote monitoring location. 
    Alarm user means any person, firm or corporation on whose premises an alarm system is maintained within the village or whose alarm is registered by indicators at a monitor panel in a receiving terminal of the police and/or fire departments except for alarm systems on motor vehicles or proprietary systems. If, however, an alarm system on a motor vehicle is connected with an alarm system at a premises (other than a proprietary system), the person, firm or corporation using such a system is an alarm user. Also, excluded from this definition and from the coverage of this article are persons, firms and corporations who use alarm systems to alert persons within the premises in which the alarm system is located of an attempted unauthorized intrusion or holdup attempt. If such system, however, employs an audible signal emitting sounds or flashing lights, or a beacon designed to signal persons outside the premises, such system shall be within the definition of alarm system and shall be subject to this article.

If a proprietary system includes a signal line connected directly to a monitor panel in a receiving terminal of the police and/or fire departments and/or alarm companies' receiving locations or an answering service, it thereby becomes an "alarm system" as the term is used in this article. 
    Signaling device means an electrically operated instrument which automatically sends visual and audible signals over a signal line to be registered by indicators at a monitor panel in a receiving terminal of the police and/or fire departments' and/or alarm companies' receiving locations to signal the presence of a hazard requiring urgent attention and to which police and/or fire personnel are expected to respond. Signaling devices shall include the terms "automatic holdup alarm systems," "burglar alarm systems," "holdup alarm systems," "manual holdup alarm systems" and "fire alarm systems." Fire alarm systems shall include alarms received from heat and smoke detectors, automatic extinguishing systems and manual pull-stations and related supervisory systems. Alarm systems shall also mean medical emergency devices. Signaling devices shall also include such systems that provide visual and/or audible systems on the premises. All such alarm systems shall conform to the appropriate building or fire codes of the village.

(6)  A statement that the applicant is willing to comply with other reasonable rules and regulations about details of installation and operation of such devices, as may be issued by the chief of police or fire chief as appropriate. 
The chief of police or fire chief, as appropriate, shall approve such application if he finds that the alarm installer has answered all questions in such application fully and truthfully, and the alarm installer maintains an adequate service organization to repair, maintain and otherwise service the signaling devices sold or leased by him. 
(c)  Permit required. No person shall install, operate or maintain signaling devices to transmit visual or audible signals over a signal line or lines to a central location without first obtaining a permit as required by this article.

The purpose of this article is to maintain this village's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program; to minimize potential losses due to periodic flooding including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare; and to preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve economic and natural values and provide for the wise utilization of water and related land resources. This article is adopted in order to accomplish the following specific purposes: 
(1)  To meet the requirements of 615 ILCS 5/18g Rivers, Lakes and Streams Act. 
(2)  To assure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage hazards to others, or creating unstable conditions susceptible to erosion; 
(3)  To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage; 
(4)  To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding; 
(5)  To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and relief operations; and 
(6)  To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in the village by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(7)  To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 CFR 59-79, as amended.

c.  The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet beyond the outside face of the structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be met, the director of public works and municipal engineer may waive the ten-foot minimum setback if an Illinois registered professional engineer certify that an alternative method to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met. The certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural design analysis, which shall be submitted to the director of public works and municipal engineer for review. The director of public works and municipal engineer may require such additional documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet. 
d.  The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a distance of 20 feet from the structure, shall be above the BFE. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained, the director of public works and municipal engineer may waive the 20-foot minimum setback distance if an Illinois registered professional engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures have been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding, shall be submitted to the village for review. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet. 
e.  The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets all requirements of this subsection and is at least five feet thick under the basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-F, if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according to ASTM standard D-2487, Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes.

(Ord. No. 08-17, § 1, 7-28-2008) 
Sec. 38-37.2. - Preventing increased damages and a list of appropriate uses. 
(1)  The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this article. Only those appropriate uses listed in 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3708 will be allowed. The approved appropriate uses are as follows: 
(a)  Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife. 
(b)  Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities, and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses; 
(c)  Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls; 
(d)  Underground and overhead utilities; 
(e)  Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems, including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions and toilet facilities (four stall maximum) that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage; 
(f)  Detached garages, storage sheds, or other non-habitable accessory structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage; 
(g)  Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any modification thereto; 
(h)  Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either: 
(i)  The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0 foot; or 
(ii)  The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility parking lot, formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events and accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all overbank flooding events. 
(i)  Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive non-erosive slop toward a watercourse. 
(j)  Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the construction of water tight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure. 
(k)  The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building, provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was damaged to 50 percent or more of the market value before the damage occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation. 
(l)  Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood elevation, and which will not block flood flows including but not limited to, fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the building is improved to 50 percent or more of the market value before the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation. 
(2)  Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an appropriate use. 
(3)  Within the designated floodway as identified on the floodway maps designated by IDNR/OWR, the construction of an appropriate use, will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of section 38-39: 
(a)  Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: 
(i)  Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n)(AR 2/3 ) where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross-section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York) 
(ii)  The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative land cover. 
(iii)  Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
1.  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length. 
2.  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length. 
3.  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one-foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
4.  Transition sections shall be provided between cross-sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway delineation on adjacent properties. 
5.  All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows. 
(b)  Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase downstream flooding. 
(i)  Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. 
(ii)  Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least 1.5 times the volume of floodplain storage lost. 
(iii)  Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. 
(iv)  The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
(v)  If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. 
(vi)  There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure. 
(c)  Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream erosion or flood heights. 
(i)  For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
(ii)  In the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures. 
(d)  Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway approaches. 
(i)  The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. 
(ii)  If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 feet, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a permit for a dam or waiver. 
1.  The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section 38-35. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA Hydraulic Chart for the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways calculation procedures. 
2.  Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per section 38-37.2(3)(b). 
3.  Velocity increases must be mitigated per section 38-37.2(3)(c). 
4.  If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received. 
5.  The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by section 38-37. 
6.  All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per section 38-37.2(3)(h). 
(e)  Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts, and approach roads. 
(i)  The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage. 
(ii)  If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties. 
(iii)  The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence before a permit is issued. 
(f)  On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water. 
(i)  Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. 
(ii)  A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. 
(iii)  All dams and impoundment structures as defined in section 38-32(15) shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that: 
1.  The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional storm water detention; 
2.  The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
3.  The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin. 
4.  A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control; 
5.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of section 38-37. 
(g)  Flood proofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial structures. 
(i)  If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building. 
(ii)  Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities. 
(h)  Excavation in the floodway. 
(i)  When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation. 
(ii)  The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
1.  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length; 
2.  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length; and 
3.  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one-foot transition vertical for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
4.  Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream of the transition sections. 
(i)  If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that: 
(i)  There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a streamside buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat; 
(ii)  Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values; 
(iii)  The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
1.  The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel modification design, where practical. 
2.  Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion. 
3.  One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation. 
4.  Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel. 
5.  Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the referred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
6.  All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover. 
7.  If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate. 
8.  A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality. 
9.  New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel. 
10.  There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project. 
11.  Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and 
(iv)  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of section 38-37. 
(j)  Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant. 
(k)  Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria: 
(i)  The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of improvements. 
(ii)  Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days. 
(iii)  Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches, and sediment traps and basins. 
(iv)  A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing channels (See 38-37.2)(3)(p)). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be re-stabilized immediately. 
(v)  Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995). 
(l)  Public flood control projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
(m)  General criteria for analysis of flood elevations. 
(i)  The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated floodway study, referenced in section 38-35, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use. 
(ii)  If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet: 
1.  The requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and 
2.  Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations. 
(iii)  If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built. 
(n)  Conditional letter of map revision. 
(i)  If the appropriate use would result in a change in the designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is issued. 
(ii)  The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as-built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging, or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. 
(iii)  In the case of non-government projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given. 
(iv)  No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. 
(v)  After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR. 
(o)  Professional engineer's supervision. All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer. 
(p)  For all activities in the floodway involving construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met: 
(i)  A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel. 
(ii)  Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of construction. 
(q)  After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as-built" plans. 
(4)  Development activities in delegated communities requiring state review. For those projects listed below located in a designated floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and concurrence and/or permit prior to the issuance of a permit by a community or county delegated state permitting authority in the floodway. 
(a)  An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge pursuant to section 38-37.2(3)(d).

(f)  Projects which revise or establish the floodway and/or flood profiles. 
(g)  Projects in public bodies of water. 
(5)  Other permits. 
(a)  In addition to the other requirements of this article, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to 615 ILCS 5/5 et seq. 
(b)  No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if IDNR/OWR has delegated this responsibility to the village. 
(6)  Permits for dams. 
(a)  Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam as defined in section 38-32(15) per 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. 
(b)  If the director of public works finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR permit, the director of public works shall immediately notify the IDNR/OWR Bartlett office. 
(c)  If the director of public works finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the director of public works shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/OWR Bartlett office, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA). 
(7)  Activities that do not require a registered professional engineer's review. The following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this article, including the mitigation requirements. 
(a)  Underground and overhead utilities that: 
(i)  Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations; or 
(ii)  Do not require the placement of above ground structures in the floodway; or 
(iii)  In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the existing streambed; and 
(iv)  Overhead utility lines shall be constructed above the estimated 100-year frequency flood elevation or attached above the low chord of an existing bridge (with the permission of the bridge owner). No supporting towers shall be placed in the watercourse and shall be designed so as to not catch debris. 
(v)  Disturbance of streamside vegetation shall be kept to minimum during construction to prevent erosion and sedimentation. All disturbed floodway areas, including the stream banks shall be restored to their original contours and seeded or otherwise stabilized upon completion of construction.

    Abandonment means the act of leaving a thing with the intent not to retain possession of or assert ownership or control over it. The intent need not coincide with the act of leaving. It is prima facie evidence of the necessary intent to abandon a vehicle containing a hazardous substance that: 
(1)  The vehicle has been left or more than two days unattended and unmoved; 
(2)  License plates or other identifying marks have been removed from the vehicle; 
(3)  The vehicle has been damaged or is deteriorated so extensively that it has value only for junk or salvage; or 
(4)  The owner or operator has been notified by a law enforcement agency to remove the vehicle, and it has not been removed within 24 hours after notification. 
    Fire chief means the fire chief of the village, or his authorized representative.

This definition shall not establish a requirement to test for the purpose of this article; or 
(6)  Any material which has been determined by the fire chief, through information based on appraisal and assessment from reliable resources, to be likely to create a significant potential or actual hazard to public health, safety, or welfare or to the environment. The fact that the material in question is not designated as a hazardous substance pursuant to subsections (1) through (5) of this definition or is excluded by the legislation or NFPA classifications of subsections (1) through (4) of this definition does not preclude the fire chief from determining that the material is a hazard, given the totality of the particular facts and circumstances. 
    Hazardous substance incident means any emergency circumstance involving the sudden release or threatened release of a hazardous substance which, in the judgment of an emergency response authority, whether said emergency response authority be the village, a mutual aid box alarm system (MABAS) agreement member unit, or a federal or state agency or other local agency, threatens immediate and irreparable harm to the environment or the health, safety, or welfare of any individual other than individuals exposed to the risks associated with hazardous substances in the normal course of their employment. Hazardous substance incident includes those incidents of releasing or abandoning of hazardous substance, whether or not such releasing or abandoning is found to threaten immediate and irreparable harm, but such term does not include any release of a hazardous substance authorized pursuant to any federal, state, or local law or regulation. 
    Person means any individual, public or private corporation, partnership, association, firm, trust, or estate, the state or any department, institution, or agency thereof, any municipal corporation, county, city and county, or other political subdivision of the state, or any other legal entity whatsoever which is recognized by law as the subject or rights and duties. 
    Release means any actual or threatened spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing into the environment, but excludes: 
(1)  Any release which results in exposure to persons solely within a workplace, with respect to a claim which such persons may assert against the employer of such persons; 
(2)  Emissions from the engine exhaust of a motor vehicle, rolling stock, aircraft, or pipeline pumping station engine;

(4)  The normal application of fertilizer. 
    Remove or removal means the cleanup or removal of released hazardous substances from the environment, such actions as may be necessary to be taken in the event of the threat of release of hazardous substances into the environment, such actions as may be necessary to monitor, assess, and evaluate the release or threat of release of hazardous substances, the disposal of removed material, or the taking of such other actions as may be necessary to prevent, minimize, or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare or the environment, which may otherwise result from a release or threat of release. The term includes, in addition, without being limited to, security fencing or other measures to limit access, provision of alternative water suppliers, temporary evacuation and housing of threatened individuals, and any emergency assistance which may be provided under the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act (20 ILCS 3305/1 et seq.), as amended, pursuant to the MABAS agreement. 
    Vehicle means any device which is capable of moving itself, or of being moved, from place to place upon wheels or endless tracks. The term includes, but is not limited to, any motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer.

1.  The street address or a legal description sufficient for identification of the potential nuisance property. 
2.  A statement that the chief of police has information that the property constitutes a potential chronic nuisance property as defined by this section, with a concise description of the criminal activity(s) or nuisance activity(s) that may exist, or that have occurred that the chief of police believes may classify the property as a potential chronic nuisance property. 
3.  Demand that the owner, manager(s) or person(s) in charge or his or her or its property manager or tenant in the event the property is a leased property or other designee respond and meet with the chief of police within 20 days of receipt of the notice. Refusal of receipt of the notice by any party to whom notice is sent shall be deemed receipt of the notice for purposes of this section. 
b.  At the meeting between the chief of police or his/her designee and the parties notified, the chief of police may request that the owner, manager(s), person(s) in charge or his or her or its tenant(s) and/or property manager, in the case of residential rental property, implement a reasonable abatement plan designed to alleviate and prevent future occurrences of criminal activity or nuisance activity upon the property. The mitigation or abatement plan shall be reasonable under the circumstances in its objective, cost and scope, and shall be implemented within 60 days of the meeting with the chief of police or such longer period if not practically feasible to do so within 60 days. 
If the criminal activity or nuisance activity complained of has or is being conducted by a tenant leasing in or on the property, and such activity is a violation of the material terms of a lease agreement, the chief of police may request that the owner evict the tenant and further request that future tenants execute a "crime free lease addendum." If eviction is requested, the owner shall proceed with such an action in good faith. The village shall assist in the eviction action by reasonably cooperating with the owner, manager(s) or person(s) in charge of the property, including, but not limited to, providing law enforcement officers or other municipal employees as witnesses regarding the nuisance activity if relevant. 
(2)  If, after complying with the procedures of subsection (b)(1) of this section, within six months from the date of the first confirmed case of criminal activity or nuisance activity after the meeting, the chief of police receives a report documenting the occurrence of a third instance of criminal activity or nuisance activity upon the property, the property may be declared a chronic nuisance property. 
(3)  It shall be a violation of this section for: 
a.  The owner, manager(s), person(s) in charge of the property, or tenant, if the property in question is a leased property, within 60 days of the meeting or such other reasonable amount of time under the circumstances, to fail to cause the implementation of a reasonable mitigation or abatement plan as requested by the chief of police; or 
b.  Any person or persons so notified to fail to respond and meet with the chief of police within the 20-day period without good cause shown. 
(4)  When any party affected by this section responds and meets with the chief of police as required above, no statements made in connection with the furnishing of that response or in a meeting shall constitute or be used in any judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding as an admission that any nuisance activity has or is occurring at or on the property. This subsection (4) does not require the exclusion of any other evidence which is otherwise admissible and offered for any other purpose than an admission by a person affected by this section. 
(e)  Abatement-Administrative hearing. 
(1)  At any hearing before the village administrative hearing officer to determine whether the property in question is a chronic nuisance property, which hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 2, Article VI of the Village Code of Ordinances, the village shall have the initial burden of proof to show, by a preponderance of evidence, that the property in question is a chronic nuisance property. Notice of the hearing shall be provided to all persons or entities that may be adversely affected by a decision declaring the property to be a chronic nuisance property. 
(2)  The village's representative shall present evidence in support of its claim that the property is a chronic nuisance property. The property owner, manager(s) or tenant(s) in possession if a leased property, or person(s) in charge or the person in charge's local representative or attorney on behalf of the responding party shall be permitted to rebut such evidence. No continuances shall be authorized by the administrative hearing officer in proceedings under this section unless for good cause shown or except where a continuance is absolutely necessary to protect the rights of any party to the proceeding. Lack of preparedness shall not be grounds for a continuance. At any time prior to the hearing date, the administrative hearing officer may, at the request of either party(s), direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence including police reports shall be admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonable, prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. 
(3)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the administrative hearing officer shall make a determination on the basis of the evidence presented at the hearing, whether or not a violation(s) exists or existed and whether or not the property is a chronic nuisance property. The determination shall be in writing and shall be designated as the findings, decision, and order. The administrative hearing officer's decision shall be final and binding, except that the provisions of the Illinois Administrative Review Law shall apply with respect to judicial review of the administrative hearing officer's findings, decision and order. The findings, decision, and order shall include the administrative hearing officer's findings of fact, a decision whether or not a violation(s) exists, a determination as to whether the property in question is or is not a chronic nuisance property based upon the findings of fact, and a monetary fine or other appropriate sanction imposed against the person(s) in Charge/manager(s)/owner(s)/ tenant(s) or occupant(s), as specified in subsection (4) below, or dismissing the case in the event a violation is not proved. A copy of the findings, decision, and order shall be served upon the person in charge, owner, or tenant or occupant, within 14 business days of the date of the hearing. 
(4)  If the administrative hearing officer makes a finding that a property was, or is, a chronic nuisance property, the administrative hearing officer may fine the manager(s), person(s) in charge and/or the owner, tenant or occupant of the property if those persons are different from the manager(s) or person(s) in charge of the property, an amount not to exceed $750.00 for each violation of this section. Each day a nuisance activity occurs or continues shall be considered a separate and distinct violation for purposes of determining a property to be a chronic nuisance property. The administrative hearing officer may, in his or her discretion, impose such a fine for each day the nuisance activity goes unabated. No person shall be found in violation of this section unless the village proves the violation by a preponderance of the evidence. 
(f)  Alternative enforcement. 
(1)  Nuisance abatement. The village, as an alternative to administrative adjudication, may commence an action in the circuit court of the county fourth municipal district or chancery division of the circuit court of the county for a determination that the property is a chronic nuisance property and/or to abate a chronic nuisance property. 
Upon being satisfied by affidavits or other sworn evidence that an alleged chronic nuisance property exists, the court may, without notice or bond, enter a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction or permanent injunction to enjoin any defendant from maintaining such chronic nuisance property and may enter an order restraining any defendant named from occupying, using or interfering with all property used in connection with the chronic nuisance property. 
(2)  Commencement of action, burden of proof. 
a.  In an action seeking closure of a chronic nuisance property, the village shall have the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is a chronic nuisance property. 
b.  It shall be an affirmative defense by the property owner of rental or leased property to an action seeking the closure of a chronic nuisance property that the owner of the property, manager(s) or person(s) in charge, at the time in question, could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the property had become a chronic nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the property had become a chronic nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct of tenants or others in possession leading to the findings that the property is a chronic nuisance property, or that the owner, tenant, or person in control of the property was the victim of a crime, including, but not limited to, an act of domestic or sexual violence, had contacted police or emergency services to prevent or respond to acts of domestic or sexual violence, or contact was made by, on behalf of, or otherwise concerned an individual with a disability, and the purpose of the contact was related to that individual's disability. The terms "domestic violence", "sexual violence", and "disability" shall have the same meaning as set forth in 65 ILCS 5/1-2-1.5. 
c.  In establishing the amount of any civil penalty or other relief requested, the court may consider any of the following factors if they are found appropriate, and shall cite those found applicable: 
1.  The actions or lack of action taken by the owner or person(s) in charge to mitigate or correct the nuisance activity at the property. 
2.  Whether the criminal activity or nuisance activity at the property was repeated or continuous. 
3.  The magnitude or gravity of the criminal activity or nuisance activity at the property. 
4.  The cooperation of the owner or person(s) in charge of the property with the village to correct the offending condition or abate the nuisance. 
5.  Whether the property owner, in the event of rental or leased property, has required the tenant(s) to sign a "crime free lease addendum." 
6.  The cost to the village of investigating and correcting or attempting to correct the condition. 
(3)  Remedy. 
a.  In the event a court determines a property to be a chronic nuisance property, the court may order that the property be closed and secured against all use and occupancy for a period of not less than 30 days, but not more than 180 days or until the nuisance activity(s) or violation(s) complained of is abated or the court may employ any other remedy deemed by it appropriate to abate the nuisance. 
b.  In addition to the remedy provided in subparagraph (a) above, the court may impose upon the owner, manager(s), person(s) in charge and/or tenant(s) or occupant(s) of the property in question a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed the sum of $750.00 per day, payable to the village, for each day the owner, person(s) in charge and/or tenant(s) or occupant(s) had actual knowledge that the property was a chronic nuisance property and permitted the property to remain a chronic nuisance property. 
c.  In determining what remedy or remedies to employ, the court may consider evidence of other conduct which has occurred on the property, including, but not limited to: 
1.  The disturbance of neighbors; 
2.  The occurrence of other criminal activity or nuisances at, on or from the property; 
3.  The property's general reputation and/or the reputation of persons in or frequenting the property; 
4.  Physical damage to the property in question or surrounding properties; 
5.  The hazard posed to any occupant of the property or adjoining property owner resulting from the physical condition of the property in question or its structures. 
d.  The court may authorize the village to physically secure the property against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so within the time specified by the court. In the event that the village is authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the village to affect the closure shall be made and assessed as a lien again the property and debt to the village. As used herein, "costs" mean those costs actually incurred by the village for the physical securing of the property. 
e.  The village building department or code enforcement department employee affecting the closure shall prepare a statement of costs, and the village shall thereafter submit said statement to the court for its review. If no objection of the statement is made within the period described by the court, a lien in said amount may be recorded against said property. 
f.  Any person who is assessed the cost of closure and/or civil penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the village. 
(g)  Chronic nuisance located at multi-unit rental residential property. In the event any chronic nuisance property is a multi-unit rental residential property, any order entered by the court to abate the nuisance or otherwise vacate the property shall, in the discretion of the court, be limited in scope as to apply only to the individual rental unit or person(s) in charge or tenant(s) or occupants of that unit forming the basis for the finding that the property is a chronic nuisance property. 
(h)  Any ordinance or portion of any ordinance in conflict with the provisions of this section is repealed solely to the extent of such conflict. 
(i)  Severability. Should any provision or portion of this section be declared void or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining portions of this section not so declared shall remain in full force and effect. 
(j)  This section shall be in full force and effect ten days after its passage, approval and publication in the manner provided by law.

ARTICLE V. - POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 17-16, § 1 (Exh. A, § I), adopted Dec. 11, 2017, did not specify manner of inclusion, hence, codification as §§ 58-191-58-196 was at the discretion of the editor. 
Note- This policy was drafted using the Illinois Department of Human Rights Sexual Harassment Model Policy and has been modified to conform to Public Act 100-0554. 

Sec. 58-191. - Prohibition on sexual harassment. 
    It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations. It is a policy of the Village of Hillside to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof. 
(Ord. No. 17-16, § 1(Exh. A, § I), 12-11-2017) 
Sec. 58-192. - Definition of sexual harassment. 
    This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as: 
    Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when: 
(1)  Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, 
(2)  Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or 
(3)  Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. 
    Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes: 
 Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even outside of their presence, of a sexual nature. 
 Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking" or "kissing" noises. 
 Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature, viewing pornographic material or websites. 
 Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault. 
 Textual/electronic: "sexting" (electronically sending messages with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter). 
    The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a "reasonable person." 
(Ord. No. 17-16, § 1(Exh. A, § II), 12-11-2017) 
Sec. 58-193. - Procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment. 
    An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report. 
    Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual harassment, including the following: 
 Electronic/direct communication . If there is sexual harassing behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo. 
 Contact with supervisory personnel . At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or administrator, or the chief executive officer of the municipality. 
    The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment. 
 Resolution outside municipality . The purpose of this policy is to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must be filed within 300 days. 
    Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages. 
    All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. 
(Ord. No. 17-16, § 1(Exh. A, § III), 12-11-2017) 
Sec. 58-194. - Prohibition on retaliation for reporting sexual harassment allegations. 
    No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal employee due to a municipal employee's: 
(1)  Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy, 
(2)  The provision of information related to or testimony before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of this policy, or 
(3)  Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this policy. 
    For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee's involvement in protected activity pursuant to this policy. 
    No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will be protected from retaliation. 
    Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who does any of the following: 
(1)  Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state agency, or other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation; 
(2)  Provides information to or testifies before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law, rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state employee; or 
(3)  Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of the state officials and Employees Ethics Act. 
    Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)). 
    According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act. 
    An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a retaliation charge - due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation. 
(Ord. No. 17-16, § 1(Exh. A, § IV), 12-11-2017) 
Sec. 58-195. - Consequences of a violation of the prohibition on sexual harassment. 
    In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a state or federal agency. 
(Ord. No. 17-16, § 1(Exh. A, § V), 12-11-2017) 
Sec. 58-196. - Consequences for knowingly making a false report. 
    A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreements. 
    In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of the state officials and Employees Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the state police, a state's attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an administrative fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) against any person who intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

The Security Fund shall serve as security for: 
(1)  The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this article; 
(2)  Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this article; and 
(3)  The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by permittee in violation of this article including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this article to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this article or any other applicable law. 
(b)  Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this Subsection shall, at a minimum: 
(1)  Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the permittee; 
(2)  Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the village of any amounts covered by it; and 
(3)  Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn. 
(c)  Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the director of public works, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the director of public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection (c) for any single phase. 
(d)  Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this Subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee: 
(1)  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder; 
(2)  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid; 
(3)  Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or 
(4)  Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund. 
(e)  Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(f)  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection (c) of this section. 
(g)  Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. 
(h)  Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility is available. 
(2)  In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the director of public works or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs.

(2)  All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach. 
(d)  Additional conditions for granting of a variance.

(1)  Green indication. 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
b.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as provided in this chapter, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(2)  Steady yellow indication. 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter. 
b.  Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in this chapter, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(3)  Steady red indication. 
a.  Except as provided in subsection (3)c of this section, vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown. 
b.  Except as provided in subsection (3)c of this section, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is shown. 
c.  Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn and local authorities by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street, after stopping as required by subsection (3)a or (3)b of this section. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right of way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the intersection or junction or roadways. Such driver shall yield the right of way to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk. 
d.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in this chapter, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
(4)  Exceptions. In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made or, in the absence of such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

Sec. 90-6. - Flashing signals. 
(a)  Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in conjunction with a traffic control device it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows: 
(1)  Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated by rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the cross walk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at a point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign. 
(2)  Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with caution. 
(b)  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by 625 ILCS 5/11-1201.

A driver facing this indication shall not drive in the lane over which the signal is located, and this indication shall modify accordingly the meaning of all other traffic controls present. Otherwise he shall obey all other traffic controls and follow normal safe driving practices. 
(3)  Yellow "X" (steady). A driver facing this indication should prepare to vacate the lane over which the signal is located, in a safe manner to avoid, if possible, occupying that lane when a steady red "X" is displayed. 
(4)  Flashing yellow arrow. A driver facing this indication may use the lane only for the purpose of approaching and making a left turn.

Said system/device is any photographic equipment linked to a violation detection system that synchronizes the taking of a photograph, video, or digital image with the occurrence of a traffic signal violation or moving infraction. 
    In operation means operating in good working order. 
    Notice of liability or citation is the notice of violation and shall include the following: 
(1)  The name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle; as indicated by the records of the Secretary of State, or, if such information is outdated or unattainable, then the last known address recorded in a United State Post Office approved database;

(8)  A statement that recorded images are evidence of a violation of a red light signal; 
(9)  A warning that failure to pay the civil penalty or to contest liability within 30 days of the mailing of the notice of violation is an admission of liability and may result in a suspension of the driving privileges of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle; and 
(10)  A statement that the registered owner of lessee of the vehicle may elect to proceed either by paying the fine stated in the notice of violation or by challenging the charge in an administrative hearing or by contesting by mail. 
    Photographic equipment may include, but is not limited to, devices which link a camera, and a computer, alone or in combination with other devices, to detect vehicles which have violated the traffic signal and to record an image of the motor vehicle, its occupants, and other objects. Such a system may also include, but is not limited to, devices that detect stop bar infractions and vehicle speeds, camera, and computer, alone or in combination with other devices, to measure the speed of a motor vehicle or other object and to record an image of the motor vehicle, or other objects. The results of photographic video, or digital imaging equipment, means the images, speed measurement, and any other data or information produced by the automated traffic enforcement system. 
    System location is the approach to a street toward which a photographic, video, or electronic camera is directed and is in operation. It is the location where the automated camera system is installed to monitor offenses under this section.

(b)  It is prima facie evidence that the person registered as the owner of the vehicle with the Illinois Secretary of State (or with any other state vehicle registration office) was operating the vehicle at the time of the offense. 
(c)  Officers or other employees or agents of the Police Department are empowered under this division to examine the photographic equipment recordings authorized under this division to determine whether a red light offense has occurred.

(f)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of an operator of a vehicle for any violation of subsection (1). 
(g)  This section shall not apply to violations involving vehicle collisions. 
(Ord. No. 11-09, § 1, 6-27-2011) 
Sec. 90-50. - Penalty.

(Ord. No. 11-09, § 1, 6-27-2011) 
Sec. 90-51. - Administrative appeal. 
(a)  A person who received a "Notice of Violation" pursuant to this section may appeal the "Notice of Violation" within 30 days from the date listed on the "Notice of Violation" by making a written request for a hearing to the address listed on the "Notice of Violation." The failure to give notice of appeal or pay the civil penalty within this time period shall constitute a waver of the right to contest the citation and will be considered an admission. Said failure shall result in an additional penalty of $100.00 for failure to pay the original penalty on or before the due date. 
(b)  Appeals shall be heard through the administrative adjudication process as established by the Village of Hillside Code of ordinances, and all rules of procedure, costs, fees and fines applicable to that process shall apply to violators processed through this Ordinance. The strict rules of evidence applicable to courts of law shall not apply to administrative appeals heard hereunder.

The hearing officer shall determine whether a preponderance of evidence establishes that a violation occurred and that the person who received the "Notice of Violation" is liable for the penalty set forth under this division. 
(d)  A certified copy of the "Notice of Violation" alleging the violation along with a copy of the image that served as a basis of the "Notice of Violation" shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein and shall be admissible in a proceeding alleging a violation under this section. 
(e)  If a prima facie case has been established as set forth in subsection (d), the hearing officer may consider the following affirmative defenses, as to which the vehicle owner identified in the citation will have the burden of proof:

(3)  That the license plate number or other source of identification of the vehicle cannot be determined; 
(4)  That the motor vehicle or registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the vehicle owner at the time of violation. To demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner. 
(5)  That the driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection when the light was red in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle, or as part of a funeral procession. 
(6)  That the driver of the vehicle entered the intersection at the direction of a police officer. 
(f)  Should the hearing officer conclude that a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that someone other than the person named in the "Notice of Violation" was operating the vehicle at the time of the violation, the hearing officer shall dismiss the citation as against the named party without penalty and forward to the police department all evidence provided to him or to her as to the operator's identity. 
(g)  Within ten business days of receiving the evidence referred to in subsection (f), the police department or its designee may issue a "Notice of Violation" to the person whom the evidence indicates was operating the vehicle at the time of the violation. 
(h)  Should a person who received a "Notice of Violation" pursuant to this section file a notice of appeal with the administrative body as set forth in subsection (a) and fail to appear at the administrative hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a default judgment against that person and that person shall be responsible for the citation penalty of $100.00 plus the additional fine of $100.00 for failure to pay the fine within 30 days, plus any hearing costs set forth in the Administrative Adjudication Ordinance. 
(i)  Late fees will be waived during the time that a person receiving a "Notice of Violation" appeals and when the administrative hearing makes a determination with regard to the "Notice of Violation" such that if a person receiving a "Notice of Violation" appeals in a timely manner in accordance with subsection (a) and the administrative hearing takes place after 30 days, the late fees stipulated in subsection (a) will not be waived.

All water customers who desire to install air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment after the effective date of this division are required to make written application therefor and to obtain approval and a permit therefor in advance from the building inspector and are required to give notice of completion of the installation. All customers who have installed air-conditioning equipment prior to the effective date of this division shall, in lieu of a permit, notify the department of buildings of such existing installation. Failure to give notice shall be considered a violation of this division. 
(2)  Use of water from village mains restricted. All air-conditioning units shall be equipped with water conservation devices so that water from the village mains shall be used for make-up and flushing purposes only. Any air-conditioning system is prohibited from using water from the mains in excess of 0.2 gallons per minute per ton. Each air-conditioning system shall be sub-metered using a water meter acceptable to the village. 
(3)  Applicability to existing units. All air-conditioning units installed heretofore must be made to comply with the provisions of this division. 
(4)  Inspections. The superintendent of public works and persons designated by him shall, at all reasonable hours, have free access to premises supplied with water for air-conditioning purposes, to examine the equipment and to ascertain if there is more water being used than allowed by this division. 
(5)  Appeals. Whenever the building inspector shall reject or refuse to approve any plan or specification for or the mode or manner of construction proposed to be used in the installation of any air-conditioning equipment, or when it is claimed that the provisions of this division do not apply or when it is claimed that the true intent and meaning of this division has been misconstrued or improperly interpreted, the owner or any person or corporation aggrieved may appeal to the fire and water committee of the board of trustees. No public advertising shall be required as a condition precedent to such appeal. The decision of the fire and water committee of the board of trustees shall be final.

ARTICLE IV. - ZONING DISTRICTS 

4.1. - Establishment of districts. 
    The Village of Hillside is hereby divided into eight "districts." The use, height and area regulations are uniform within each district and said districts shall be known as: 
4.1(1)  R-1 single-family residence district. The R-1 single-family residence district is intended to provide regulations which will maintain the character and stability of single-family neighborhoods in the village, which will have lot sizes not less than 8,600 square feet in area, and a density of approximately 5.2 dwellings per net acre. 
4.1(2)  R-2 single-family residence district. R-2 single-family residence district is intended to provide regulations which will maintain the character and stability of single-family neighborhoods in the village, which will have lot sizes not less than 6,200 square feet in area, and a density of approximately seven dwellings per net acre. 
4.1(3)  R-3 multiple-family residence district. The R-3 multiple-family residence district is intended to provide regulations which will tend to develop and maintain the character and stability of the townhouse (single-family attached and semi-detached), and garden apartment type (low density multiple-family dwellings) parts of the village and which have a density of not more than 12 units per net acre. 
4.1(4)  R-4 multiple-family residence district. The R-4 multiple-family residence district is intended to provide for construction of a residential environment in an area subject to economic and population pressures which cannot be alleviated by existing single-family or other multiple-family residential zoning. Accordingly, the use of land and buildings within R-4 district should permit a density of not more than 16 units per net acre. 
4.1(5)  B-1 general business district. The B-1 general business district classification is established to accommodate a wide range of commercial types of establishments to serve the needs of the public. The general business district may be located adjacent to other business districts to form a complete business center, or may be commercial areas consisting entirely of specialized commercial activities. 
4.1(6)  B-2 planned shopping center district. The B-2 planned shopping center district regulations are designed to accommodate prime retail trade activities of multi-community or regional significance. Regulations provide for a wide variety of related retail business establishments along with personal service and other complementary uses characteristic of major shopping centers. 
4.1(7)  M-1 office and restricted industrial district. The office and restricted industrial district regulations are intended to govern the location and use of office and research establishments serving the metropolitan area, and the industrial activities that require an equally pleasant and nuisance-free environment and will be compatible with adjacent residential and business uses. 
4.1(8)  M-2 light industrial district. The M-2 light industrial district is established to accommodate those industrial activities that have moderate environmental effects and are located in areas relatively remote from residential and commercial development. 
4.1(9)  M-3 limited industrial district. The M-3 limited industrial district is intended to provide for industrial and related activities of a limited scope in a nuisance-free environment compatible with adjacent residential uses.

4.3(3) Where it appears that a zoning district boundary line divides a lot in single ownership, the exact location of the line shall be resolved by the zoning administrator. 
4.4. - Annexed land. 
    All territory hereafter annexed to the Village of Hillside shall be, and the same is hereby classified for zoning purposes as, R-1 single-family residence district, unless otherwise provided for by preannexation agreement.

11.5(4)(b) The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any person having an interest in the property; 
11.5(4)(c) The variation, if granted, will not alter the character of the locality nor be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements, and will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or adversely affect the health, safety or welfare of the community. 
11.5(4)(d) The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances such as the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical condition of the specific property, and that these circumstances would not be generally applicable to other property within the same zoning classification. 
    11.5(5)  Conditions. The zoning board of appeals may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary to comply with standards set out in this section and reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood and to carry out the general intent of this zoning ordinance. 
    11.5(6)  Authorized variations. Variations from the regulations of this zoning ordinance shall be granted by the board of appeals only in accordance with the standards set out in section 11.5(4) and may be granted only in the following instances, and in no others:

11.5(6)(g) To increase the height of any building other than a single-family dwelling, or structure other than an outdoor sign, permitted under the regulations of the district in which it is located or is to be located, by not more than 25 percent of the applicable maximum height restrictions.

11.7. - Special uses. 
    11.7(1)  Purpose. The formulation and enactment of a comprehensive ordinance is based on the division of the entire village into districts in each of which are permitted specified uses that are mutually compatible. In addition to such permitted, compatible uses, however, it is recognized that there are other uses which it may be necessary or desirable to allow in a given district but which on account of their potential influence upon neighboring uses or public facilities need to be carefully regulated with respect to location or operation for the protection of the community. Such uses are classified in this ordinance as "special uses" and fall into three categories: 
11.7(1)(a) Uses either municipally operated or operated by publicly regulated utilities, or uses traditionally affected by a public interest; 
11.7(1)(b) Uses entirely private in character which, on account of their peculiar locational need, the nature of the service they offer to the public, and their possible unique, special or unusual impact upon use or enjoyment of neighboring property, may have to be established in a district or districts in which they cannot reasonably be allowed as an unrestricted permitted use under the zoning regulations; and 
11.7(1)(c) Planned developments as set forth in paragraph 11.10 of this article. 
    11.7(2)  Initiation. Special uses may be proposed by the board of trustees, plan commission[,] by a person, firm, or corporation having a fee interest, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, a contractual interest which may become a fee interest, an option to purchase, or any exclusive possessory interest which is specifically enforceable on the land which is described in the application prescribed by the zoning board of appeals.

11.7(3)(a) An application for a special use shall be filed with the zoning administrator and thereafter entered into the records of the next meeting of the zoning board of appeals. 
11.7(3)(b) The zoning board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time, not to exceed 60 days, for the hearing of the request for special use permit and give due notice to the applicant and publish the same as required by law. 
11.7(3)(c) The zoning board of appeals shall deliberate publicly upon the petition within 30 days of the date of the hearing. The zoning board of appeals may, upon notice to all interested parties, postpone all decisions for another 30 days but no longer. 
11.7(3)(d) Findings and recommendations of the zoning board of appeals shall be submitted to the village board not later than 60 days following the public hearing.
