PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of 
Warsaw, Indiana. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1974 Code, as supplemented through 
April 20, 1998, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the common council. The source of each section 
is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note 
indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use 
of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 
1974 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various 
sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of 
the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first 
section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same 
time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For 
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions 
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter 
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the 
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may 
be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical 
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

CODE INDEX

Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under 
several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still 
others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item 
in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Code Attorney, and Robert D. 
MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given 
to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the 
project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to The Honorable Ernest Wiggins, Mayor, Ms. Elaine Call, Clerk-
Treasurer, and Mr. William Fawley, Attorney-at-Law for their cooperation and assistance during the 
progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have 
resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all 
citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed.

city. A supplement to this Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of 
ordinances adopted during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in 
the Code. The pages of the supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code

otherwise provided by law or ordinance, with respect to violations of this Code that are continuous 
with respect to time, each day that the violation continues is a separate offense. 
(d) ?The imposition of a penalty does not prevent suspension or revocation of a license, permit or 
franchise or other administrative sanctions. 
(e) ?Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may be 
abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent injunctive 
relief. 
(f) ?If it is necessary for the city to file a civil action to enforce any ordinance, the city shall be entitled to 
recover a reasonable attorney's fee, in addition to amounts to which it is otherwise entitled. The total 
amount of such judgment shall not exceed the maximum allowable under state law.

result in glare in the eyes of flyers using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or 
otherwise endanger the landing, taking off or maneuvering of aircraft. 
(Code 1974, § 3-24) 


Sec. 10-61. - Creation, establishment and description of zones. 
    In order to carry out the provisions of this division, there are hereby created and established certain 
zones which include all of the land lying within the instrument approach zones, noninstrument approach 
zones, transition zones, horizontal zones and conical zones. Such areas and zones are shown on the city 
municipal zoning map consisting of one sheet, prepared by D.H. Lessig Engineers, Inc., and dated 
September 6, 1960. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1) ?Instrument approach zone. An instrument approach zone is established at each end of the 
instrument runway for instrument landings and takeoffs. The instrument approach zones shall 
have a width of 1,000 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway, widening 
thereafter uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a distance of 50,200 feet beyond each end of 
the runway, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(2) ?Noninstrument approach zone. A noninstrument approach zone is established at each end of 
all noninstrument runways on the airport for noninstrument landings and takeoffs. The 
noninstrument approach landing zone shall have a width of 300 feet at a distance of 200 feet 
beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of 2,300 feet at a 
distance of 10,200 feet beyond each end of the runway, its centerline being the continuation of 
the centerline of the runway. 
(3) ?Transition zones. Transition zones are hereby established adjacent to each instrument and 
noninstrument runway and approach zone as indicated on the zoning map. Transition zones 
symmetrically located on either side of runways have variable widths as shown on the zoning 
map. Transition zones extend outward from a line 150 feet on either side of the centerline of the 
noninstrument runway, for a length of such runway, plus 200 feet on each side, and 500 feet on 
either side of the centerline of the instrument runway, for a length of such runway plus 200 feet 
on each end, and are parallel and level with such runway centerline. The transition zones along 
such runways slope upward and outward one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to 
the point where they intersect the surface of the horizontal zone. Further, transition zones are 
established adjacent to both instrument and noninstrument approach zones for the entire length 
of the approach zones. These transition zones have variable widths, as shown on the zoning 
map. Such transition zones flare symmetrically with either side of the runway approach zones 
from the base of such zones and slope upward and outward at the rate of one foot vertically for 
each seven feet horizontally to the points where they intersect the surface of the horizontal and 
conical zones. Additionally, transition zones are established adjacent to the instrument 
approach zone where they project through and beyond the limits of the conical zone, extending 
a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the instrument approach zones 
at right angles to the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(4) ?Horizontal zone. A horizontal zone is hereby established as the area within a circle with its 
center at the airport reference point and having a radius of 6,000 feet. The horizontal zone does 
not include the instrument and noninstrument approach zones and the transition zones. 
(5) ?Conical zone. A conical zone is hereby established commencing at the periphery of the 
horizontal zone and extending to a distance of 11,000 feet from the airport reference point. The 
conical zone does not include the instrument and noninstrument approach zones and transition 
zones.

Sec. 10-62. - Height limitations. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this division, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to 
grow or be maintained in any zone created by this division to a height in excess of the height limit 
established in this section for such zone. Such height limitations are computed from the established 
airport elevation and are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
(1) ?Instrument approach zones: One foot in height for each 50 feet of horizontal distance beginning 
at a point 200 feet from the end of the instrument runway and extending to a distance of 10,200 
feet from the end of the runway; thence one foot in height for each 40 feet of horizontal distance 
to a point 50,200 feet from the end of the runway. 
(2) ?Noninstrument approach zones: One foot in height for each 40 feet of horizontal distance 
beginning at a point 200 feet from the end of the noninstrument runway and extending to a point 
10,200 feet from the end of the runway. 
(3) ?Transition zones: One foot in height for each seven feet of horizontal distance beginning at a 
point 150 feet from the centerline of noninstrument runways and 500 feet from the centerline of 
the instrument runway, measured at right angles to the location of the longitudinal centerline of 
the runway, extending upward to a maximum height of 150 feet above the established airport 
elevation. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits of one foot vertical 
height for each seven feet of horizontal distance measured from the edge of all approach zones, 
for the entire length of the approach zones and extending upward and outward to the points 
where they intersect the horizontal and conical surface. Further, where the instrument approach 
zone projects through and beyond the conical zone, a height limit of one foot for each seven 
feet of horizontal distance shall be maintained beginning at the edge of the instrument approach 
zone and extending a distance of 5,000 feet from the edge of the instrument approach zone 
measured at right angles to the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(4) ?Horizontal zone: 150 feet above the established airport elevation or a maximum height of 
994.77 feet above mean sea level elevation. 
(5) ?Conical zone: One foot in height for each 20 feet of horizontal distance beginning at the 
periphery of the horizontal zone and measured through an inclined plane passing the airport 
reference point. 
Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail. 
Nothing in this division shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any 
tree or structure to a height up to 45 feet above the surface of the land.

when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such instrument 
or noninstrument approach zone. 
(3) ?In the zones lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal 
zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height 
above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of the terrain, land contour or 
topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
(b) ?Nothing contained in any of the exceptions of subsection (a) of this section shall be construed as 
permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration or growth of any structure or tree in

(a) ?The building commissioner for the city shall review all applications for site improvement, new 
construction, additions to existing buildings or structures or other development to determine whether 
the proposed construction, addition or development exists in a flood district which this article defines: 
(1) ?If the site pertaining to the application exists in a floodway district, or in the floodway lake 
district, the building commissioner shall forward the application and related plans and 
specifications to the department of natural resources for approval. The building commissioner 
for the city may issue a permit only after the department of natural resources issues a permit. If 
the department of natural resources and the city issue a permit, the applicant must verify that 
the flood protection grade for the proposed building or structure is two feet above the regulatory 
flood profile. 
(2) ?If the site pertaining to the application exists in a floodway fringe district or floodway fringe 
around lake district, the building commissioner for the city may issue a permit if the applicant 
verifies that the flood protection grade for all buildings and structures is two feet above the 
regulatory flood profile. 
(3) ?If the site pertaining to the application exists in a floodplain district, the building commissioner 
for the city shall forward the application and related plans and specifications to the department 
of natural resources for approval. The building commissioner for the city may issue a 
recommendation to the commission before the application is approved by the commission. If the 
department of natural resources or the city issues a permit, the applicant must verify that the 
flood protection grade for the proposed building or structure is two feet above the regulatory 
flood profile. 
(4) ?If the site pertaining to the application exists in a flood district which this article defines, the 
building commissioner for the city may require design and materials modifications which prevent 
the building or structure from flotation, collapse or lateral movement and minimize potential 
flood damage. Additionally, the building commissioner for the city shall require all electrical, 
heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and other service facilities to be flood 
protected. 
(b) ?In reviewing permit applications for compliance with this article, the building commissioner for the 
city shall ensure that the applicant has obtained all necessary federal, state and local permits. 
(Code 1974, § 10.5-21; Ord. No. 2002-03-02, § 2, 3-18-2002)

basement floor elevations, certificates, plans and other materials associated with any permit, 
variance or special exception which the city issues in a floodway, floodway fringe, floodplain, 
floodway lake or floodway fringe around lake district. 
(2) ?The plan commission shall report to the Federal Insurance Administration all permits which the 
building commissioner for the city issues in the floodway district and which affect watercourse 
direction. The report shall include a permit copy. The plan commission for the city shall require 
the applicant to provide maintenance within the altered or relocated portion of such watercourse 
to prevent the development from diminishing the flood-carrying capacity. 
(Code 1974, § 10.5-22) 


Sec. 46-63. - Variances and exceptions. 
(a) ?Board of zoning appeals. This article shall guide determinations of the board of zoning appeals with 
respect to user requests for variances or exceptions in any of the flood districts which this article 
establishes. 
(b) ?Issuance. 
(1) ?Applicant assurances. The board of zoning appeals may issue a variance to the floodway, 
floodway fringe, floodplain, floodway lake, or floodway fringe around lake district terms and 
provisions if the applicant verifies that: 
a. ?The applicant has good and sufficient cause for requesting the variance; 
b. ?The applicant will experience exceptional hardship if the board of zoning appeals applies 
the article terms strictly; and 
c. ?The variance will not increase flood heights, create additional threats to public safety,

Secs. 46-64—46-90. - Reserved. 


DIVISION 3. - DISTRICTS AND DISTRICT REGULATIONS 


Sec. 46-91. - Basis for designating flood hazard areas. 
    The Federal Emergency Management Agency, through the city flood insurance study dated February 
4, 1987, has identified flood hazard areas in the city with revised preliminary flood maps. The flood 
boundary and floodway map, which identifies city flood districts, and the flood insurance rate maps, which 
designate flood insurance premiums for areas within the flood district, represent the best available data 
and provide the basis for designating flood hazard areas. These maps are on file at the city plan 
commission office. 
(Code 1974, § 10.5-31) 


Sec. 46-92. - Establishment of districts; description; boundaries. 
    The flood hazard areas, which the flood insurance study maps identify, consist of flood districts. This 
article establishes overlay districts with underlying zoning districts which the city has established in the 
city zoning Ordinance No. 81-12-2. The flood districts will impose or could impose additional restrictions 
on buildings and structures which the zoning districts regulate. 
(1) ?Floodplain district. The floodplain district regulates development in areas which lakes do not 
abut and for which no source has provided detailed flood data. The flood boundary and 
floodway map identifies the floodplain district as an approximate 100-year flood boundary which 
a dashed line delineates, and the flood insurance rate map identifies the district as zone A. 
(2) ?Floodway district. The floodway district regulates development in areas which the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency has identified as the floodway. The floodway is that area 
which carries the principal floodwater flow. The flood boundary and floodway map identifies the 
floodway district as the white area which the blue-shaded floodway fringe surrounds and the 
dashed line delineates. These maps have delineated the floodway district in compliance with 
current rules, procedures and policies of the commission. 
(3) ?Floodway fringe district. The floodway fringe district regulates development in areas subject to 
potential flooding damage, but outside an identified floodway district. The floodway fringe is the 
area adjacent to the floodway that does not carry the principal floodwater flow. The flood 
boundary and floodway map identifies the floodway fringe district as the dark blue-shaded area 
which the solid line delineates. The flood insurance rate map identifies the floodway fringe 
district as the dark blue-shaded areas labeled A1-A30, and/or AE. The floodway fringe district's 
principal requirement is that the flood protection grade of all buildings shall be at least two feet 
above the regulatory flood profile. The floodway fringe district regulates the development in 
areas which lakes do not abut and which are subject to potential flood damages but which are 
outside the floodway district. 
(4) ?Floodway fringe around lake district. The purpose of the floodway fringe around lake district is 
to guide development in areas subject to potential flood damage around the shoreline and land 
contiguous to the overlay with the floodway fringe district. The floodway fringe around lake 
district represents the area adjacent to the floodway lake district which is above the previously 
established legal lake level. The requirements for building in a floodway fringe around lake 
district are the same as in the floodway fringe district. The flood insurance rate map identifies 
the floodway fringe around lake district as the dark blue-shaded area which the solid line 
delineates. 
(5) ?Floodway lake district. The floodway district in the lake regulates development in the areas 
below the established legal lake levels. Any development below this level requires approval 
from the department of natural resources. 
(6) ?Regulatory flood elevation. This article's protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best 
available regulatory flood data is listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best 
available data, the party submitting the detailed engineering study needs to replace existing 
data with better data and submit it to the department of natural resources for review and 
approval. 
a. ?The regulatory flood elevation and floodway limits for the SFHAs of Tippecanoe River, 
Deeds Creek, Center Lake, Pike Lake and Winona Lake shall be as delineated on the 100-
year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of the city dated February 4, 1987, and the 
corresponding FIRM dated February 4, 1987, prepared by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. 
b. ?The regulatory flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an AH zone or AO zone shall 
be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the flood insurance rate map of the city. 
c. ?The regulatory flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an A zone on 
the flood insurance rate map of the city shall be according to the best data available as 
provided by the department of natural resources. 
d. ?The regulatory flood elevation and floodway limits for the SFHAs of those parts of the 
unincorporated county that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city or that may 
be annexed into the city shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood 
insurance study of the county dated February 4, 1987, and the corresponding FIRM dated 
February 4, 1987, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
e. ?If the SFHA is delineated as an AH zone or AO zone, the elevation (or depth) will be 
delineated on the county flood insurance rate map. If the SFHA is delineated as zone A on 
the county flood insurance rate map, the regulatory flood elevation shall be according to 
the best data available as provided by the department of natural resources.

(a) ?Definition. A "nonconforming use" is any building, structure or other use in a floodplain, floodway, 
floodway fringe district, floodway lake or floodway fringe around lake district, which does not conform 
to this article, provided that the building, structure or other use is in existence at the time this article 
is enacted. 
(b) ?Uses. 
(1) ?In a floodway district, no user may expand or enlarge a nonconforming use or substantially 
modify a building or structure without a department of natural resources construction permit. 
(2) ?In a floodway lake district, no user may expand or enlarge a nonconforming use or substantially 
modify a building or structure without a department of natural resources construction permit. 
(3) ?In a floodway fringe district, a user may substantially modify a nonconforming use, provided 
that the user verifies that the modification is on a one-time basis and does not increase the 
value of any building or structure by more than 40 percent of its fair market value prior to such 
modification. When calculating the value of improvements, the surrounding realty of such 
building or structure will not be referred to within such calculation. This article waives these 
modification requirements if the user permanently changes the use to conforming. 
(4) ?In a floodway fringe around lake district, a user may substantially modify a nonconforming use, 
provided that the user verifies that the modification is on a one-time basis and does not increase 
the value of any building or structure by more than 40 percent of its fair-market value prior to 
such modification. When calculating the value of improvement, the surrounding realty of the 
building or structure will not be referred to within such calculation. This article waives these 
modification requirements if the user permanently changes the use to conforming. 
(5) ?In a floodplain district, a user may alter, enlarge or expand a nonconforming use, provided that 
the user follows new construction procedures which this article establishes for floodplain district 
use, verifies that the modification is on a one-time basis and verifies that the alteration, 
enlargement or expansion does not increase the value of any building or structure by more than 
40 percent of its fair market value prior to such modification. 
(6) ?In a floodway, floodway fringe, floodplain district, floodway lake or floodway fringe around lake 
district, a user may restore a nonconforming use to original dimensions and conditions after fire, 
flood, explosion, natural disaster, accident or public enemy damages the use, provided that the 
damage does not reduce building or structure value (excluding land value) by more than 40 
percent of value prior to such damage; provided further that such value shall not include the 
value of realty surrounding the building or structure. 
(Code 1974, § 10.5-35) 


Sec. 46-96. - Subdivision control. 
(a) ?Application. This article imposes special subdivision control requirements for flood districts. The city 
subdivision ordinance regulates subdivision development generally. 
(b) ?Subdivision review. The building commissioner for the city shall review subdivision proposals to 
determine whether the proposal exists in a flood district which this article establishes. If the building 
commissioner determines that the proposal exists in a floodway, floodway lake, or floodplain district, 
he will forward the application and related plans and materials to the department of natural resources 
for review and comment. 
(c) ?Base flood elevation data. The building commissioner for the city shall require that the applicant 
proposing subdivisions greater than 50 lots or five acres submit base flood elevation data for the 
proposed subdivision site. 
(d) ?Standards and conditions. The building commissioner for the city may require an applicant to make 
appropriate changes and modifications to assure that the proposal minimizes potential flood 
damage. The applicant shall locate and construct sewer, gas, electrical and water systems to 
minimize or eliminate flood damage. The applicant shall provide adequate drainage systems which 
reduce flood hazard exposure. If the subdivision requires on-site disposal systems, the applicant 
shall construct the systems in a secure location which avoids leakage and contamination if a 
regulatory flood occurs. 
(e) ?Plat requirement. An applicant, whose proposed subdivision or portion of proposed subdivision 
exists in a flood fringe district or flood fringe around lake district, must identify and label the 
regulatory flood elevation on the subdivision plat the applicant submits. All subdivision plats in 
floodway fringe and floodway lake fringe districts must have covenants attached prohibiting buildings 
under two feet above the regulatory flood level.

Sec. 47-10. - Control and design. 
    A plan shall utilize the latest edition of the Indiana Handbook for Erosion Control in Developing Areas 
for technical guidance for all erosion and sediment control practices. A plan shall incorporate the following 
design criteria where applicable: 
(1) ?Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing through the site shall be diverted around 
disturbed areas, if practical. Otherwise, the channel shall be protected as described in section 
47-7. Sheetflow runoff from adjacent areas greater than 10,000 square feet in area will also be 
diverted around disturbed areas unless shown to have resultant runoff velocities of less than 0.5 
feet/second across the disturbed area for the set of two-year design storms. Diverted runoff 
shall be conveyed in a manner that will not erode the conveyance and receiving channels. 
(Note: Soil conservation service guidelines for allowable velocities in different types of channels 
should be followed.); 
(2) ?For sites with ten acres or more disturbed at one time, or if a channel originates in the 
disturbed area, one or more sedimentation basins shall be constructed. Each sedimentation 
basin shall have a surface area of at least one percent of the area draining to the basin and at 
least three feet of depth and shall be constructed in accordance with accepted design 
specifications. Sediment shall be removed to maintain a depth of three feet. The basin shall be 
designed to trap sediment greater than 15 microns in size based on the set of two-year design 
storms having durations from 0.5 minutes to 24 hours. The basin discharge rate shall be 
sufficiently low as to not cause erosion along the discharge channel; 
(3) ?For sites with fewer than ten acres disturbed at one time, filter fences, straw bales or equivalent 
measures shall be placed along all side slopes of the site. If a channel or area of concentrated 
runoff passes through the site, filter fences shall be placed along the channel edges to reduce 
sediment reaching the channel. Diversion ditches and other sediment control measures meeting 
the specifications outlined in sections 47-4 through 47-11 may be utilized at the discretion of the 
city planning department; 
(4) ?Land-disturbing activity shall be performed in a construction sequence to the satisfaction of the 
city planning department in order to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time. 
(5) ?Content of control plan statement for land-disturbing activities covering less than one acre. 
An erosion control plan statement (with simple map) shall be submitted to briefly describe the 
site erosion controls (including the site development schedule) that will be used to meet the 
requirements of this chapter. 
(6) ?Review of control plan. Within five working days of receipt of the application and/or control plan 
statement, the office of the city planning department shall review the application and/or control 
plan to determine if the requirements of this chapter are met. This review, whenever practicable, 
shall be done concurrently with other related construction permit applications. The city planning 
department may request comments regarding the plan or statement from other departments or 
agencies. If the requirements of this chapter are met, the city planning department shall approve 
the plan, inform the applicant and issue a permit. If the conditions are not met, the city planning 
department shall inform the applicant in writing and either may request needed information or 
disapprove the plan. Within 30 days of receipt of the newly submitted information, the city 
planning department shall again determine if the plan meets this chapter's requirements. If the 
plan is disapproved again, the city planning department shall inform the applicant in writing of 
the reasons for the disapproval. Appeal from this decision may be brought to the board of 
zoning appeals, as provided for by Indiana Code Section 36-7-4-918.1. 
(7) ?Permits. 
a. ?Duration. Permits shall be valid for a period of 180 days, or run concurrently with the 
building permit or other construction authorizations, whichever is longer. At the written 
request of the permittee, the city planning department may extend the period one or more 
times for up to an additional 180 days. The city planning department may require additional 
control measures as a condition of the extension if they are necessary to meet the 
requirements of this chapter. 
b. ?Financial guarantee of performance. 
1. ?A financial guarantee shall not be required for the construction of one-or two-family 
dwelling units and related accessory structures or improvements. 
2. ?In all other instances, as a condition of approval for issuance of the permit, the city 
planning department shall require the applicant to deposit a surety bond, irrevocable 
letter of credit, certificate of deposit held as a security, or any other form of financial 
guarantee of performance acceptable to the city planning department to guarantee a 
good faith execution of the approved control plan and any permit conditions. The 
amount of the financial guarantee shall be provided by the developer or project 
engineer and approved by the city planning department. The financial guarantee of 
performance will not be released until project is in compliance with erosion control 
measures, including the establishment of a vegetative cover appropriate for the 
season. The financial guarantee may be cashed by the city to provide for payment of 
any costs or penalties imposed due to violations of the provisions of this chapter or 
noncompliance with the conditions and specifications for the issuance of a permit. 
3. ?The surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, certificate of deposit held as a security, or 
any other form of financial guarantee of performance acceptable to the city planning 
department shall be kept current. Any lapse of such financial guarantee shall be 
considered as a violation of this chapter. 
c. ?Permit conditions. All permits shall require the permittee to:

Sec. 78-101. - Testing. 
    All building service connections (pipeline connecting buildings with the municipal sanitary sewer) 
shall be tested before being connected to the mainline sewer. Pipelines failing any of the test procedures 
shall be removed, reconstructed, and retested until the test results are satisfactory. Each service 
connection shall be tested with the following tests. 
(1) ?A leakage test using a low-pressure air test in accordance with ASTM F1417-92. The general 
test procedure shall be as follows: 
a. ?If any part of the service connection is below the ground water table, determine the height 
of the water table over the lowest pipe section. The air pressure specified below shall be 
increased by 0.43 times for each foot of water over the pipe. 
b. ?Clean and flush the pipe to be tested. Flushing with water is important because it dampens 
the pipe wall. 
c. ?Plug all pipe outlets with pneumatic plugs having a sealing length equal or greater than the 
diameter of the pipe to be tested. The pneumatic plugs shall be able to resist internal 
testing pressures without requiring external bracing. 
d. ?Once the pipe outlet plugs are securely in place, pressurized air shall be introduced to the 
system. The air shall be fed through a single control panel with three individual hose 
connections as follows: 
1. ?From the control panel to pneumatic plugs for inflation in sewer pipe. 
2. ?From control panel to scaled line for introducing the pressurized air. 
3. ?From sealed line to control panel. This line will enable continuous monitoring of the air 
pressure rise in the sealed line. 
e. ?All air used in performing the test shall pass through a shut-off valve, pressure regulating 
valve, pressure relief valve, input pressure gauge, and a continuous monitoring gauge 
having a pressure range from 0 to 10 psi. The continuous monitoring gauge shall have 
minimum divisions of 0.20 psi. 
f. ?Slowly introduce air to the section of pipe under evaluation until the internal air pressure is 
raised to 3.5 psi greater than the hydrostatic pressure head created by the existence of 
groundwater that is over the pipe section. 
g. ?When temperatures have been equalized and the pressure stabilized at 3.5 psi for two 
minutes, the air supply shall be shut off or disconnected and the stopwatch started for the 
test. 
h. ?Observe the pressure gauge and record the time required for the pressure to drop from 3.5 
psi to 2.5 psi. The test is acceptable if the time, in minutes, for the pressure to drop is 
greater than the time shown in the following table:

properly located Y branch is available, the owner shall, at his expense, install a Y branch in the public 
sewer at the location specified by the superintendent. Where the public sewer is greater than 12 inches in 
diameter, and no properly located Y branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to 
receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees. A 45-
degree ell may be used to make such connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the 
inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at 
the same or at a higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made,

method of measurement acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge. 
(d) ?In the event two or more dwelling units such as mobile homes and apartments, (by way of example 
and not limitation) discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids into the city's sanitary sewage 
system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a 
water meter, then in such case, billing shall be calculated in accordance with section 78-155 and 
section 78-156, provided that with respect to the base charge calculation in section 78-156, the 
collection system portion of the base charge shall be $8.21 (as provided in section 78-156 for five-
eighths-inch through three-quarters-inch base charge) multiplied by the number of dwelling units. In 
the case of mobile home courts, the number of dwelling units shall be computed and interpreted as 
the total number of mobile home spaces available for rent, plus any other dwelling units served 
through the meter. In the case of apartments, the number of dwelling units shall be computed and 
interpreted as the total number of rooms regardless of occupancy.

cost to the city, but not less than $150.00. 
(2) ?If the requested connection is to replace an existing connection and will increase the amount of 
sewage for treatment entering the system, the connection charge will be determined by the 
common council and shall not exceed the standard connection charges outlined in this division. 
(3) ?A connection charge for a residential use may be reduced to $150.00 and for a commercial use 
may be reduced to $250.00 if the person requesting the connection can provide to the common

and hardship for the person requesting the waiver or reduction. 
(4) ?Under no circumstances shall the connection charges determined in accordance with this 
section exceed the standard charges described in this division. 
(5) ?The decision of the common council shall be final. 
(b) ?Conditions of request. The common council, upon written request of a person desiring to connect to 
the sanitary sewer system in the city, may waive or reduce the connection charge, subject to the

pretreatment standards found in 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471. Effluent 
limitations promulgated by the Federal Act shall apply in any instance where they are more stringent 
than those in this division. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter 1, 
Subchapter N, Parts 405—471 and any future promulgated regulations are hereby incorporated. 
(1) ?Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of the concentration of a 
pollutant in wastewater, the utility may impose equivalent mass limits in accordance with 
subsection (d)(4) of this section and 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
(2) ?When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not 
regulated by the same standard, the utility shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 
CFR 403.6(e). 
(3) ?A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance 
with 40 CFR 403.15 
(4) ?When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant 
concentrations, a CIU may request that the utility convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. 
The determination to convert concentration limits to mass is within the discretion of the utility. 
The utility may establish equivalent mass limits only if the CIU meets all the conditions set forth 
in 40 CFR 403.6(c)(5). 
(5) ?Once included in the permit, the CIU must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in 
this subsection (d) in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent 
limitations were derived. 
(6) ?Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily 
discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day 
average, limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow 
figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. 
(7) ?Any CIU operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass limits calculated from a 
production-based standard shall notify the utility within two business days after the CIU has a 
reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next 
calendar month. Any CIU not notifying the utility of such anticipated change will be required to 
meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of 
the long term average production rate. 
(e) ?State pretreatment standards. A user shall comply with state pretreatment standards applicable to 
the user. If the state pretreatment standards are less stringent than the national pretreatment 
standards or local limits applicable to the user, the user shall comply with the more stringent 
standards. The state pretreatment standards, as amended from time to time, are hereby 
incorporated by the reference into this division. 
(f) ?Local effluent limits. 
(1) ?The utility is authorized to establish local limits, by ordinance, order, or in wastewater discharge 
permits, pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c) and (d). 
(2) ?The following pollutant limits are established by ordinance to protect against pass through and 
interference. Users may not discharge into the wastewater utility any wastewater containing in 
excess of the following daily maximum limit.

The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All 
concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. The utility 
may impose mass limitations in addition to the concentration-based limitations above. 
(3) ?The City of Warsaw Wastewater Utility, which has an approved pretreatment program will 
continue to review (i.e., NPDES permit cycle, any pass through or interference violation, etc.) 
local effluent limits and develop and/or revise these limits as necessary and effectively enforce 
such limits, as appropriate, which together with appropriate changes in the POTW treatment 
plant's facilities or operations, are necessary to ensure renewed and continued compliance with 
the POTW's NPDES permit or sludge use or disposal practices. 
(4) ?The utility may develop best management practices (BMPs) for any SIU or other user, as 
needed, to implement this division. BMPs may be implemented through a wastewater discharge 
permit, order, or other notice to the user. BMPs are pretreatment standards and enforceable 
under this division. 
(g) ?Right of revision. The utility reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge 
permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the 
purpose of this division. 
(h) ?Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way to attempt to dilute a 
discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a 
discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or 
requirement. The utility may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet 
pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is 
appropriate. 
(i) ?Discretionary action. Where circumstances so warrant the utility may agree to arrangements with 
users which modify the terms of this division if that arrangement complies with the NPDES permit of 
the utility and all other federal and state laws and regulations governing the operation of the

(j) ?Pretreatment of wastewater. 
(1) ?Pretreatment facilities In the event that a user is exceeding the limitations as set forth in 
subsections 78-243(a) through (i), the utility shall direct the user causing the discharge of any 
such materials to cease and desist from those activities or operations which cause a violation of 
established discharge standards or to provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply 
with this division and to achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local 
effluent limits, and the prohibitions set out in subsections 78-243(a) through (i) of this division 
within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the utility, whichever is more stringent. 
Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the 
user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be 
submitted to the utility for review, and shall be acceptable to the utility before such facilities are 
constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user 
from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge 
acceptable to the utility under the provisions of this division. 
Any facility classified as an industrial treatment plant per 327 IAC 5-22 shall meet the operator 
certification requirements in accordance with 327 IAC 5-22, as amended. 
(2) ?Additional pretreatment measures. 
a. ?Whenever deemed necessary, the utility may require users to restrict their discharge during 
peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific 
sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams 
from other facility waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to 
protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this 
division. 
b. ?The utility may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on 
their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure 
equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow 
equalization. 
c. ?Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided for the proper handling of wastewater 
containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; unless a waiver is granted by the 
utility (normally not applicable to residential dwellings). All interception units shall be of a 
type and capacity approved by the utility and shall be so located to be easily accessible for 
cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired by the

violate the pretreatment standards in this division. 
d. ?Waste from garbage grinders shall not be discharged into a sanitary sewer except: 
1. ?Wastes generated in preparation of food normally consumed on the premises; or 
2. ?Where the user has obtained authorization for that specific use from the utility, and 
agreed to undertake whatever self-monitoring is required to enable the utility to 
equitably determine the user charges based on the waste constituents and 
characteristics. 
These grinders shall shred the waste so that all particles shall be carried freely under 
normal flow conditions prevailing in the sanitary sewer. Garbage grinders shall not be used 
for grinding plastic, paper products, inert materials or garden refuse. 
e. ?Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and 
maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(3) ?Accidental discharge/slug discharge control plans. Each user shall provide protection from 
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other regulated wastes described in subsections 
78-243(a) through (i) of this division. Those facilities shall be provided and maintained at the 
user's expense. 
The utility shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge 
control plan or other action to control slug discharges. The utility may require any user to 
develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be 
necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the utility may develop such a plan for any 
user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the 
following: 
a. ?Description of discharge practices, including non routine batch discharges; 
b. ?Description of stored chemicals;

(6) ?Purpose and policy. 
a. ?Objectives. This section sets forth uniform requirements for dischargers (food service 
establishments(FSEs)) into the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) for the city which 
also may be referred to as the "wastewater utility". The objectives of this division are to: 
1. ?Eliminate large amounts of grease buildup in the collection system piping. 
2. ?Reduce frequent extensive cleaning and/or replacement of collection system piping. 
3. ?Increase effective treatment of wastewater at city POTW. 
b. ?Abbreviations. 
1. ?FOG: fats, oil and grease. 
2. ?FSE: food service establishment. 
3. ?BMP: best management practices. 
c. ?Definitions. Unless a provision explicitly states otherwise, the following words, terms and 
phrases, as used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, 
except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. 
    Grease trap. A reservoir inside the FSE usually under the three-bay sink area that is 
built into the wastewater piping a short distance from the grease producing area. Baffles in 
the reservoir retain the wastewater long enough for the grease to congeal and rise to the 
surface, the heavier solids sink to the bottom, allowing the cleaner water to flow from the 
system. The grease trap contents can then be cleaned out of the trap and disposed of 
properly. 
    Grease interceptor. An interceptor is a vault that is located on the exterior of the 
building usually underground. The vault includes a minimum of two compartments, and a 
flow between each compartment is designed for grease and solids retention. The capacity 
of the interceptor provides adequate time so the wastewater can cool, and then congeal 
and rise to the surface, while solids accumulate at the bottom until the interceptor is 
cleaned. 
d. ?Requirements. 
1. ?Grease trap. Cleaning shall be at least once a week, unless determined to be cleaned 
more often or less often by the city. All solids, grease and water shall be removed 
when cleaned. 
2. ?Grease interceptor. Cleaning shall be no less than every 90 days, unless determined 
by the city the need to clean more or less often. The interceptor shall be completely 
cleaned to where all grease, solids and water is removed on all cleaning events, with 
no decanting back into the interceptor. An interceptor shall maintain 25 percent or less 
of solids and/or grease, or it shall be subject to cleaning, even if it has been recently 
cleaned within the FSE's normal cleaning schedule. A professional waste company 
shall be used in the cleaning and maintenance of a grease interceptor. 
3. ?Existing FSE. Upon request of the city, the FSE shall have a grease trap or interceptor 
installed if currently one does not exist. These devices must be installed according to 
manufacturer's specifications. The installation must be in compliance with IC 25-28.5-
1-11. Each installation must be permitted by the city building and planning 
department. 
4. ?Renovation/change of ownership/new construction. Whenever deemed necessary by 
the city, the FSE shall install either a grease trap or interceptor. A new interceptor 
must/shall be a minimum of 1,000 gallons capacity. These devices must be installed 
according to manufacturer's specifications. The installation must be in compliance with 
IC 25-28.5-1-11. Each installation must be permitted by the city building and planning 
department. 
5. ?Records. [Records] shall be provided to the city upon request and remain on file at the 
FSE for a minimum of three years from date of last cleaning event.

(b) ?Wastewater discharge permit requirement. Based upon a review of this information provided on the 
specific form, the utility shall determine whether or not a discharge permit must be issued or revised 
and what type of wastewater discharge permit or control document is appropriate for the user. 
(1) ?No SIU shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining a SIU wastewater 
discharge permit from the utility. 
(2) ?The utility may require other users to obtain non-SIU or other wastewater discharge permits as 
necessary or issue other control documents to carry out the purposes of this division. 
(3) ?Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit or other control 
document shall be deemed a violation of this division and subjects the wastewater discharge 
permittee to the sanctions set out in section 78-246 of this division. Obtaining a wastewater 
discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and 
state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state,

requirements; 
(2) ?To address significant alterations or additions to the user's operation, processes, or wastewater 
volume or character since the time of the wastewater discharge permit issuance; 
(3) ?A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination 
of the authorized discharge; 
(4) ?Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the POTW, utility 
personnel, the receiving waters, or the POTW's beneficial sludge use; 
(5) ?Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater discharge permit; 
(6) ?Misrepresentations or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge 
permit application or in any required reporting; 
(7) ?Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical pretreatment standards pursuant to 40 CFR 
403.13; 
(8) ?To correct typographical or other errors in the wastewater discharge permit; or 
(9) ?To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or operation to a new owner or operator where 
requested in accordance with subsection (j). 
(j) ?Wastewater discharge permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits may be transferred to a new 
owner or operator only if the permittee gives a minimum of 30 days advance notice to the utility and 
the utility approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice to the utility must include a 
written certification by the owner or operator which: 
(1) ?States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to change the facility's 
operations or processes; 
(2) ?Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and 
(3) ?Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing wastewater discharge permit. 
    Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater discharge permit void as of 
the date of facility transfer. 
(k) ?Wastewater discharge permit revocation. The utility may revoke a wastewater discharge permit for 
good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
(1) ?Failure to notify the utility of significant changes to the wastewater prior to the changed 
discharge; 
(2) ?Failure to provide prior notification to the utility of changed conditions pursuant to subsection 
78-245.1(f) of this division; 
(3) ?Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge 
permit application; 
(4) ?Falsifying self-monitoring reports and certification statement; 
(5) ?Tampering with monitoring equipment; 
(6) ?Refusing to allow the utility timely access to the facility premises and records; 
(7) ?Failure to meet effluent limitations; 
(8) ?Failure to pay fines; 
(9) ?Failure to pay sewer charges; 
(10) ?Failure to meet compliance schedules; 
(11) ?Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge permit application; or 
(12) ?Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business ownership of a permitted facility; 
or 
(13) ?Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of the wastewater 
discharge permit or this division. 
    Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or transfer of business 
ownership. All wastewater discharge permits issued to a user are void upon the issuance of a new 
wastewater discharge permit to that user. 
(l) ?Wastewater discharge permit reissuance. A user with an expiring wastewater discharge permit shall 
apply for wastewater discharge permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit application, in 
accordance with subsection 78-245(c) of this division, a minimum of 90 days prior to the expiration of 
the user's existing wastewater discharge permit.

Sec. 78-245.1. - Reporting requirements. 
(a) ?CIU and NSCIU Baseline monitoring Reports. 
(1) ?Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the 
final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)4, whichever is 
later, existing CIUs currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit 
to the utility a report which contains the information listed in subsection (2), below. At least 90 
days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become CIUs 
subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the utility 
a report which contains the information listed in subsection (2), below. A new source shall report 
the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new 
source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be 
discharged. 
(2) ?CIUs described above shall submit the information set forth below: 
a. ?All information required in subsection 78-245(c). 
b. ?Measurement of pollutants. 
1. ?The CIU shall provide the information required in subsection 78-24(c)(1)g.1.—4. 
2. ?The CIU shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data 
necessary to comply with the requirements of this subsection. 
3. ?Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such 
exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. 
If other wastestreams are mixed with the regulated wastestream prior to pretreatment 
the CIU should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the 
combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the 
pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been 
calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with 
supporting data shall be submitted to the utility. 
4. ?Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with subsections 78-245.2(c) 
and (d). 
5. ?The utility may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical 
data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for 
industrial pretreatment measures. 
6. ?The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of 
analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal 
work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
c. ?Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the CIUs authorized representative and 
certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being 
met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance 
(O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and 
requirements. 
d. ?Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the 
pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such 
additional pretreatment or O&M, must be provided. The completion date in this schedule 
shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment 
standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set 
out in subsection (b) of this division. 
e. ?Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be certified in 
accordance with subsection (n)(1), below, and signed by an authorized representative. 
(b) ?CIU compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance 
schedule as required in subsection (a)(2)d., above: 
(1) ?The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement 
and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional 
pretreatment required for the CIU to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events 
include, but not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing 
contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and 
conducting routine operation); 
(2) ?No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months; 
(3) ?The CIU shall submit a progress report to the utility no later than 14 days following each date in 
the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it 
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps 
being taken by the CIU to return to the established schedule; and 
(4) ?In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the utility. 
(c) ?CIU reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days 
following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the 
case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, 
any CIU subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the utility a report 
containing the information described in subsections 78-245(c)(1)f. and g., and subsection 78-
245.1(a)(2)b. of this division. For CIUs subject to equivalent mass limits established in accordance 
with procedures in subsection 78-243(d), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the CIU's 
long-term production rate. For all other CIUs subject to categorical pretreatment standards 
expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of 
operation), this report shall include the CIU's actual production during the appropriate sampling 
period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 78-
245.1(n) of this division. All sampling will be done in conformance with section 78-245.2. 
(d) ?SIU periodic compliance reports. 
(1) ?All permitted industrial dischargers must, at a frequency determined by the utility submit no less 
than twice per year (June and December, or on dates specified) reports indicating the nature, 
concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the 
measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases 
where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention 
alternative, the SIU must submit documentation required by the utility or the pretreatment 
standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the SIU. 
(2) ?The utility may authorize a CIU to forgo sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical 
pretreatment standard if the CIU has demonstrated through sampling and other technical 
factors that the pollutant is neither present or expected to be present in the discharge, or is 
present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant 
due to activities of the CIU. [See 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2).] This authorization is subject to the 
following conditions: 
a. ?The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to 
sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is 
not regulated by an applicable categorical pretreatment standard and otherwise includes 
no process wastewater. 
b. ?The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the SIU 
wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five years. The CIU must submit a 
new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent SIU 
wastewater discharge permit. 
c. ?In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the CIU must provide data from 
at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at 
the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
d. ?The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with definition of 
"authorized or duly authorized representative of the user," and include the certification 
statement in subsection (n)(1) (40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii)) of this section. 
e. ?Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not 
present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum 
detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
f. ?Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the utility must be included as a condition in the CIU's 
permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the CIU in its 
request for the waiver must be maintained by the utility for three years after expiration of 
the waiver. 
g. ?Upon the approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the CIU's permit by the utility, 
the CIU must certify on each report with the statement in subsection (n)(1) of this section, 
that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the 
CIU. 
h. ?In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present because of changes that occur in 
the CIU's operations, the CIU must immediately: 
Comply with monitoring requirements of subsection 78-245.1(d)(1) or other more frequent 
monitoring requirements imposed by the utility, and notify the utility. 
i. ?This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in 
categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical 
pretreatment standard. 
(3) ?All SIU periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 
78-245.1(n)(1) of this division. 
(4) ?Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through 
appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report (this 
requirement is achieved through providing a copy of the laboratory analysis report along with 
the chain of custody), based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the 
reporting period. 
(5) ?All required reports as mentioned in this section, shall be based upon data obtained through 
appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which 
data is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The control authority 
(utility) shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance 
by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(6) ?If a SIU subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at 
the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the utility, using the 
procedures prescribed in section 78-245.2 of this division, the results of this monitoring shall be 
included in the report. 
(e) ?Non-CIU compliance schedule reports. Any non-CIU which is not in compliance with this division 
shall develop a compliance schedule by which time the user shall meet the discharge prohibitions or 
requirements in section 78-243 of this division. The schedule should contain increments of progress, 
which correspond to specific dates for their completion. All users subject to these conditions shall 
submit a progress report to the utility no later than 14 days following each date in the compliance 
schedule. This report shall state if it complies with the increment of progress to be met on that date, 
the reason for delay if the date was not met, and the steps being taken to return to compliance. In no 
event shall more than six months elapse between each progress reports. 
(f) ?Report of changed conditions. Each user must notify the utility of any significant changes to the 
user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 
30 days before the change. 
(1) ?The utility may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to 
evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit 
application. 
(2) ?The utility may issue a new or revised discharge permit in response to changed conditions or 
anticipated changed conditions. 
(g) ?Reports of potential problems. 
(1) ?In the case of any discharge, including but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a 
non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, 
that might cause potential problems for the POTW, any user shall immediately telephone and 
notify the utility of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type 
of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective action(s) taken by the user. 
(2) ?Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the utility, submit a 
detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by 
the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any 
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result as a result of 
damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall 
such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed 
pursuant to this division. 
(3) ?A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place 
advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (g)(1), 
above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, 
are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(4) ?SIUs are also required to notify the utility immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the 
potential for a slug discharge. 
(h) ?Reports from non-SIUs. All users not required to obtain a SIU wastewater discharge permit shall 
provide appropriate reports to the utility as required. 
(i) ?Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a 
violation, the user must notify the utility within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user 
shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the utility 
within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the user is not required if the 
utility performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the utility performs sampling 
at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or 
the utility receives the results of this sampling, or if the utility has performed the sampling in lieu of 
the user. If the utility performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the user, the utility will perform 
the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to 
perform sampling and analysis. 
(j) ?Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1) ?Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA 
Regional Waste Management Division Director, and the state hazardous waste authorities, in 
writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would 
be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the 
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the 
type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100. kilograms 
of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following 
information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: 
An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, and an estimation of the 
mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that 
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to 
be discharged during the following 12 months. The user shall notify the POTW within 24 hours 
of becoming aware of the discharge. All notifications to EPA and the state must take place no 
later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need 
be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of 
changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (f), above, within this section of the 
division. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already 
reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring 
requirements of subsections (a), (c) and (d), above, within this section of the division. 
(2) ?Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (j)(1), above, during a calendar 
month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the 
wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge 
of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any 
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a 
one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such 
quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3) ?In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional 
characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, 
the user must notify the utility, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and 
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the 
effective date of such regulations. 
(4) ?In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a 
program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the 
degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5) ?This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be 
discharged by this division, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(k) ?Date of receipt of reports. Mailed, written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date 
postmarked. For written reports which are faxed, scanned and emailed, or hand-delivered, the date 
of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(l) ?Electronic reporting. Upon approval, users sending electronic (digital) documents to the utility to 
satisfy the requirements of this section must meet the requirements of future requirements of EPA 
and State of Indiana regulations. 
(m) ?Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain, and make 
available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring 
activities required by this division, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to 
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements and documentation 
associated with best management practices established under subsection 78-243(f)(3). 
    Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the 
person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analysis; the 
analytical or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a 
period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation 
concerning the user or the utility, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention 
period by the utility. 
(n) ?Certification statements. 
(1) ?With permit applications, user reports and initial monitoring waiver, the following certification 
statement is required to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit applications in 
accordance with subsection 78-245(d), SIUs submitting baseline monitoring reports under 
subsection 78-245.1(a)(2)e., CIUs submitting reports on compliance with the categorical 
pretreatment standard deadlines under subsection 78-245.1(c), SIUs submitting periodic 
compliance reports required by subsections 78-245.1(d)(1)—(4), CIUs submitting an initial 
request to forgo sampling of a pollutant on the basis of subsection 78-245.1(d)(2)d., and non-
SIUs submitting reports required by subsection 78-245.1(h). The following certification 
statement must be signed by an authorized representative as defined in subsection 78-242: 
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my 
direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel 
properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or 
persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the 
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, 
and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, 
including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations. 
(2) ?Annual certification for non-significant categorical industrial users. A facility determined to be a 
non-significant categorical industrial user by the utility pursuant to section 78-242 and 
subsection 78-245(d)(3) must annually submit the following certification statement signed in 
accordance with the signatory requirements in section 78-242. This certification must 
accompany an alternative report required by the utility: 
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance 
with the Categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR ____________ , I certify that, to the 
best of my knowledge and belief that during the period from ____________ / ____________ / 
____________ , ____________ to ____________ / ____________ / ____________ , 
____________ [months, days, year]: 
(a) ?The facility described as ____________ [facility name] met the definition of a Non-
Significant Categorical Industrial User as described in section 78-242; 
(b) ?The facility complied with all applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements during 
this reporting period; and 
(c) ?The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total categorical wastewater on any 
given day during this reporting period. 
This compliance certification is based on the following information: 
_____
_____
_____

(3) ?As the utility may authorize a waiver for any CIU for any pollutant that the CIU has 
demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors, that the pollutant is neither present 
or expected to be, in the discharge, or in the background levels from the intake water, the CIU 
must provide with each required monitoring report the following certification statement: 
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance 
with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR ____________ [specify applicable National 
Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has 
not been any increase in the level of ____________ [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to 
the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under subsection 78-245.1(d). 
(Ord. No. 2006-02-01, 2-6-2006; Ord. No. 2012-03-05, 3-19-2012) 


Sec. 78-245.2. - Sampling and compliance monitoring. 
(a) ?Representative sample. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. 
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and 
maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in 
good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are 
unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(b) ?Control manhole. All users who discharge pollutants other than sewage to the POTW and who 
make a new connection or modify an existing connection to the POTW shall install a control manhole 
unless the utility determines that a control manhole is not required. In addition, the utility shall have 
authority to require any user, at the user's expense, to install a control manhole if the utility 
determines that such a manhole is necessary to protect the utility. 
(c) ?Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as 
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the 
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in 
an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or 
analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 
sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and 
analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling 
and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the utility or other parties approved by 
EPA. 
(d) ?Sample collection. 
(1) ?Except as indicated in subsections (2) and (3), below, the user must collect wastewater 
samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-
proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the utility. Where time-
proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the utility, the samples must 
be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) 
specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected 
during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total 
phenols, and sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or field; for volatile 
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite 
samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in 
approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the utility, as appropriate. In addition, grab 
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
(2) ?Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile 
organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(3) ?For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports 
required in subsections 78-245.1(a) and (c) [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab 
samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic 
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data does not exist; for facilities for which 
historical data is available, the utility may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required 
by subsection 78-245.1(d) (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the SIU is required to collect the 
number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable 
pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(e) ?Right of entry; inspection and sampling. The utility shall have the right to enter the premises, at 
reasonable times, of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of 
this division and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the 
utility ready access to all areas of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records 
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1) ?Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance 
before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security 
personnel so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the utility shall be permitted to 
enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(2) ?The utility shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such 
devices as are necessary to conduct independent sampling and/or metering of the user's 
operation. 
(3) ?The utility may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's 
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper 
operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater 
flow and quality shall be calibrated at least annually to ensure their accuracy. When the 
monitoring facility is constructed in the public right-of-way or easement, in an unobstructed 
location, the location of the monitoring facility shall provide ample room in or near the monitoring 
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples and analysis. Whether 
constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities should be provided in 
accordance with the utility's requirements and all applicable construction standards and 
specifications. 
(4) ?Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected 
and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the 
utility and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
(5) ?Unreasonable delays in allowing the utility access to the user's premises shall be a violation of 
this division. 
(f) ?Search warrants. If the utility has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any 
part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of 
this division, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and 
sampling program of the utility designed to verify compliance with this division or any permit in order 
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, the 
utility may seek issuance of a search warrant from the appropriate authorities in Kosciusko County, 
Indiana.

    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit 
application, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the utility's inspection and 
sampling activities, shall be made available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically 
requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the utility, that the release of such information 
would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets 
under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the 
information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such 
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or 
secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available 
immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or 
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. 
Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not 
be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. No. 2012-03-05, 3-19-2012) 


Sec. 78-246. - Enforcement. 
(a) ?Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(1) ?Notification of violation. When the utility finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, 
any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any 
other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utility may use the option of notifying the user 
through either verbal notice (telephone notice—minor infraction), site visit (discuss and observe 
problem), or sending a written notice of violation (NOV). The most widely used by the utility is 
the written NOV. Within ten working days of receipt of such notice, an explanation of the 
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific 
required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the utility. Submission of such a plan in no 
way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice 
of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the utility to take any action, 
including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of 
violation. 
(2) ?Show cause hearing. The utility may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, 
any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any 
other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the utility and show cause why 
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user 
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for 
such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action 
should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or 
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may 
be served on any authorized representative of the user as defined in section 78-242. A show 
cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the 
user. 
(3) ?Administrative or compliance orders. When the utility finds that a user has violated, or 
continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order 
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utility may issue an 
order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance 
within a specified time frame. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to 
address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices 
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order 
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or 
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including 
any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a 
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. If the user does not come into 
compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued or fines and penalties 
may be applied. 
(4) ?Cease and desist orders. When the utility finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, 
any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any 
other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, 
the utility may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and 
directing the user to: 
a. ?Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
b. ?Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be needed to properly 
address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or 
terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, 
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(5) ?Revocation of permit or emergency suspensions. The utility may immediately suspend a user's 
discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an 
actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to be present, or cause an imminent 
or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of person. The utility may also immediately 
suspend or revoke as defined in subsection 78-245(k) a user's discharge permit, after notice 
and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which 
presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
a. ?Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its 
contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the 
suspension order, the utility may take such steps as deemed necessary, including 
immediate severance of the connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its 
receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The utility may allow the user to 
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the utility 
that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in 
subsection 78-246 (a)(6) of this division are initiated against the user. 
b. ?A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent 
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the 
harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the utility 
prior to the date of any show cause hearing or termination hearing under subsections 78-
246(a)(3) or (6) of this division. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency 
suspension or revocation of any discharge permit under this section. 
(6) ?Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in subsection (a)(5), above, of this 
division, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
a. ?Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
b. ?Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its 
discharge; 
c. ?Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and 
characteristics prior to discharge; 
d. ?Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, 
monitoring, or sampling; or 
e. ?Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 78-243 of this division; 
f. ?Failure to comply with administrative enforcement remedies in this division. 
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an 
opportunity to show cause under subsection (a)(2), above, why the proposed action should not 
be taken. Exercise of this option by the utility shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking 
any other action against the user. 
(7) ?Publication of users in significant noncompliance. The utility shall publish annually, in a 
newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions 
served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the previous 12 months, were 
in SNC with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term SNC shall be 
applicable to all SIUs (or any other user that violates subsections (3), (4), or (8) of this section) 
and shall mean: 
a. ?Chronic violations of wastewater discharge permits, defined here as those in which 66 
percent or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken 
during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or 
requirement, including instantaneous limits defined in 78-243; 
b. ?Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or 
more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month 
period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement 
including instantaneous limits, as defined by section 78-242 multiplied by the applicable 
criteria (1.4 for fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
c. ?Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by section 78-242 
(daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the 
utility determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference 
or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general 
public; 
d. ?Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the 
environment, or has resulted in the utility's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or 
prevent such a discharge; 
e. ?Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone 
contained in a SIU wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting 
construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
f. ?Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline 
monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard 
deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance 
schedules; 
g. ?Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
h. ?Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best management practices, which 
the utility determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local 
pretreatment program. 
(8) ?Right of appeal. Any user affected by any decision, action or determination, including cease 
and desist orders, made by the utility, interpreting or implementing the provisions of this section 
or in any authorization issue herein, may file with the utility a written request for reconsideration 
within ten days of such decision, action, or determination, setting forth in detail the facts 
supporting the user's request for reconsideration. 
If the ruling made by the utility is unsatisfactory to the person requesting reconsideration, he or 
she may, within ten days after notification of utility action, file a written appeal to the utility. The 
written appeal shall be heard by the utility within 30 days from the date of filing. The utility shall 
make a final ruling on the appeal within ten days of the close of the meeting. The utility's 
decision, action, or determination shall remain in effect during that period of reconsideration. 
(9) ?Authority assessed fines. Any discharger who is found to have violated or continues to violate 
(particularly without showing good faith to resolve) an order of the authority or who has failed to 
comply with any provision of this division, and the regulations, or rules of the authority, may be 
subjected to the imposition of a fine(s) by the authority. The fine or fines may vary from $500.00 
to $1,000.00 per violation per day. The total violation cost for each industry will be billed along 
with the regular pretreatment/sewer billing methods. 
(Code 1974, § 22-155; Ord. No. 2006-02-01, 2-6-2006; Ord. No. 2012-03-05, 3-19-2012) 


Sec. 78-247. - Penalties; recovery of costs; other charges. 
(a) ?Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(1) ?Injunctive relief. When the utility finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any 
provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any 
other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utility may petition the appropriate local court in 
Kosciusko County, Indiana, through the utility's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or 
permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of 
the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this division on 
activities of the user. The utility may also seek such action as is appropriate for legal and/or 
equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A 
petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other 
action against a user. 
(2) ?Civil penalties. 
a. ?User who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater 
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or 
requirement shall be liable to the utility for a maximum civil penalty of $2,500.00 for any 
first offense, and $5,000.00 for any second offense per violation, per day. In the case of a 
monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day 
during the period of the violation. 
b. ?The utility may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses 
associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and 
the cost of any actual damages incurred by the utility. 
c. ?In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant 
circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the 
magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's 
violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other 
factor as justice requires. 
d. ?Any user who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or certification in any 
application, record, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to 
this division, or who falsified, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring 
device or method required under this division shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine 
of not more than $1,500.00 per day, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. 
e. ?Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any 
other action against a user. 
(3) ?Recovery of costs. When a discharger of wastes causes an obstruction, damage, or any other 
impairment to the POTW, the utility may assess a charge against the user for the work required 
to clean or repair the facility and add that charge to the user's charges and fees. The user may 
be responsible for paying the following (but not limited to) costs: 
a. ?Cost of mileage and labor incurred in detecting and correcting the violation; 
b. ?Laboratory analysis costs associated with detecting and correcting the violation; 
c. ?Additional treatment costs caused by the violation or associated with detecting and 
correcting the violation; 
d. ?Costs of any additional equipment acquired or expended by the utility for or correcting the 
violation; 
e. ?Repair and/or replacement of any part of the sewage system damaged by the violation; 
f. ?Any liability, damages, fines or penalties incurred by the utility as a result of the violation; 
g. ?Any and all expenses of outside professionals to include, but not limited to, engineers, 
scientists, and/or legal counsel; and 
h. ?Any other costs associated with the detection and correction of the violations. 
(b) ?Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this division are not exclusive. The utility may 
take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of 
pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the utility's enforcement response plan. 
However, the utility may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, 
the utility is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(c) ?Supplemental enforcement action. 
(1) ?Payment of outstanding fees and penalties. The utility may decline to issue or reissue a 
wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or 
penalties incurred as a result of any provision of this division, a previous wastewater discharge 
permit, or order issued hereunder. 
(2) ?Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or 
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a 
public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the utility. Any person(s) 
creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the City Code governing such 
nuisances, including reimbursing the utility for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or 
remedying said nuisance. 
(3) ?Contractor listing. Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment 
standards and requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale of goods 
or services to the utility. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the utility held by 
a user found to be in significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards or requirements 
may be terminated at the discretion of the utility. 
(Code 1974, § 22-156; Ord. No. 2006-02-01, 2-6-2006; Ord. No. 2012-03-05, 3-19-2012) 


Sec. 78-247.1. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a) ?CIU upset. 
(1) ?For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is 
unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of 
factors beyond the reasonable control of the CIU. An upset does not include noncompliance to 
the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate 
treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2) ?An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with 
categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (3), below, are met. 
(3) ?A CIU who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through 
properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a. ?An upset occurred and the CIU can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b. ?The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in 
compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c. ?The CIU has submitted the following information to the utility within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the upset [if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be 
provided within five days]: 
1. ?A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2. ?The period of noncompliance, including the exact dates and times or, if not corrected, 
the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3. ?Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the 
noncompliance. 
(4) ?In any enforcement proceeding, the CIU seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall 
have the burden of proof. 
(5) ?CIUs shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an 
enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6) ?CIUs shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance 
with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility 
until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement 
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment 
facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b) ?Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action 
brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 78-243(a) of this 
division or the specific prohibitions in subsection 78-243(b) of this division if it can prove that it did 
not know, or have reason to believe or know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with 
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1) ?A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance, with each limit 
directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2) ?No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents 
from the user's prior discharge when the utility was regularly in compliance with its NPDES 
permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or 
disposal requirements. 
(c) ?Bypass. 
(1) ?For the purpose of this section: 
a. ?Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's 
treatment facility. 
b. ?Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the 
treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent 
loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a 
bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in 
production. 
(2) ?A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or 
requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient 
operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this 
section. 
(3) ?Bypass notifications. 
a. ?If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the utility, 
at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
b. ?A user shall submit oral notice to the utility of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds 
applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the 
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user 
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the 
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if 
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and 
steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The 
utility may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been 
received within 24 hours. 
(d) ?Bypass. 
(1) ?Bypass is prohibited, and the utility may take an enforcement action against a user for a 
bypass, unless: 
a. ?Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b. ?There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment 
facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of 
equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should 
have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent bypass 
which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative 
maintenance; and 
c. ?The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section 
(2) ?The utility may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the utility 
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section. 
(e) ?Enforcement issuance appeal process. Any person, representative of including the user, may 
petition the utility to reconsider the enforcement action taken against the entity per the following: 
(1) ?Within 15 working days of issuance of the enforcement action request, the entity shall have the 
right to request an administrative review of the enforcement 
(2) ?The right to an administrative review will expire 16 working days after date of issuance of the 
enforcement notice. 
(3) ?In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the enforcement provision(s) objected to, the 
reasons for the objection, if any, and list or define any procedures or processes to be instituted 
to correct or eliminate the possibility or probability of condition to occur in the future. 
(4) ?The utility will respond to the entity's request within 15 working days of receipt of appeal 
request. 
(5) ?The effectiveness of the enforcement request shall not be stayed pending an appeal.

Sec. 78-248. - Record retention. 
    Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain, and make available for 
inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required 
by this division, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities 
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best 
management practices established under subsection 78-243(f)(3), Records, shall include the date, exact 
place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates 
analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and 
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This 
period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the utility, 
or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the utility.

Sec. 78-311. - Suspension of MS4 access. 
(a) ?Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The Warsaw Wastewater Treatment 
Utility may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension 
is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and 
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or 
Waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an 
emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to 
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to 
persons. 
(b) ?Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation 
of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an 
illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed termination 
of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration 
and hearing. 
    A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant 
to this section, without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency. 
(Ord. No. 2005-01-01, 1-3-2005) 


Sec. 78-312. - Industrial or construction activity discharges.

industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental 
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses 
through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a 
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, 
at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge 
of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a 
valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the 
extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be 
part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of 
the NPDES permit.

ARTICLE V. - STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST CONSTRUCTION OPERATION AND 
MAINTENANCE 


Sec. 78-500. - Applicability and exemptions. 
(a) ?The stormwater pollution prevention plan, which is to be submitted to the city municipal separate 
storm sewer system (MS4) operator as part of the stormwater management permit application, must 
also include post-construction stormwater quality measures. These measures are incorporated as a 
permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place following completion of construction 
activities to continuously treat stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within 
the city that includes clearing, grading, excavation, concrete or bituminous paving, and other land 
disturbing activities, resulting in the disturbance of or impact on one acre or more of total land area, 
is subject to the requirements of this chapter. This includes both new development and re-
development, and disturbances of less than one acre of land that are part of a larger common plan of 
development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one or more acres of land, 
within the MS4 area. 
(b) ?The requirements under this chapter do not apply to the following activities: 
(1) ?Agricultural land disturbing activities; or 
(2) ?Forest harvesting activities; or 
(3) ?Construction activities associated with a single-family residential dwelling disturbing less than 
one acre, when the dwelling is not part of a larger common plan of development or sale; or 
(4) ?Single-family residential developments consisting of four or less lots; or 
(c) ?The requirements under this chapter do not apply to the following activities, provided other 
applicable state permits contain provisions requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control 
measures: 
(1) ?Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under 329 IAC 10. 
(2) ?Coal mining activities permitted under IC 14-34. 
(3) ?Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant to a permit issued by the 
Indiana Department of Environmental Management under 329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent 
stormwater requirements, including the expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new 
cells either within or outside the original solid waste permit boundary. 
(d) ?It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a site improvement permit 
application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is completed and submitted to the city 
municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) operator in accordance with the city's Erosion and 
Sediment Control Ordinance and/or 327 IAC 15-5 (Rule 5). It will be the responsibility of the project 
site owner and/or project site owner's designee to ensure proper construction and installation of all 
stormwater BMPs in compliance with this article and with the approved stormwater management 
permit, and to notify the city municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) operator with a sufficient 
notice of termination letter upon completion of the project and stabilization of the site. However, all 
eventual property owners of stormwater quality management facilities meeting the applicability 
requirements must comply with the requirements of this chapter and this article. 
(Ord. No. 2006-07-06, 7-17-2006) 


Sec. 78-501. - Policy on stormwater quality management. 
(a) ?It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped areas, generally have increased 
imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates, increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of 
pollutants such as fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new development 
and re-development continues in the city, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants 
from stormwater runoff prior to reaching legal drains, streams, rivers, and lakes. Through the use of 
best management practices (BMPs), stormwater runoff will be filtered and harmful amounts of 
sediment, nutrients, and contaminants will be removed. The city has adopted a policy that the control 
of stormwater quality will be based on the management of total suspended solids (TSS). 
(b) ?The project site owner must submit to the city MS4 operator, a stormwater pollution prevention plan 
(SWPPP). The stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) must include the following 
information: 
•A description of potential pollutant sources from the proposed land use, that may reasonably be 
expected to add a significant amount of pollutants to stormwater discharges. 
•Location, dimensions, detailed specifications, and construction details of all postconstruction 
stormwater quality measures (BMP's). 
•A description of measures that will be installed to control pollutants in stormwater discharges that 
will occur after construction activities have been completed. Such practices include infiltration of run-
off, flow reduction by use of open vegetated swales and natural depressions, buffer strip and riparian 
zone preservation, filter strip creation, minimization of land disturbance and surface imperviousness, 
maximization of open space, and stormwater retention and detention ponds. 
•A sequence describing when each postconstruction stormwater quality measure will be installed. 
•Stormwater quality measures that will remove or minimize pollutants from stormwater run-off. 
•Stormwater quality measures that will be implemented to prevent or minimize adverse impacts to 
stream and riparian habitat. 
•A narrative description of the maintenance guidelines for all postconstruction stormwater quality 
measures to facilitate their proper long term function. This narrative description shall be made

phone call to designated authority, e-mail to designated authority. The recipient will understand 
that each escalating response will be recorded (date and time) by stormwater utility. 
(2) ?If no change has occurred within 48 hours of the verbal warning, a notice of noncompliance 
(NONC) will be written out to the offender. This allows the offender to appropriately respond by 
making the necessary changes without implementation of the fines and/or halting the current 
operation. 
(3) ?If the offender does not respond to the notice of noncompliance within the first 48 hours, the 
offender shall receive a notice of violation (NOV). This allows the offender to appropriately 
respond by making the necessary changes without implementation of the fines and/or halting 
the current operation. 
(b) ?Noncompliance and enforcement. 
(1) ?The offending entity will receive a notification of violation (NOV) and will have 48 hours to 
remedy the offense or 48 hours to appeal to the city board of works about the offense. The 
offending entity will receive a decision after the following scheduled board of works meeting. 
a. ?If the issue is not remedied or appealed within 48 hours, the offender will be notified of the 
range of the fine called for by this article with a stop work order. 
b. ?Fines may be levied on the project owner's site representative or an individual operating on 
the project owner's site. 
c. ?Each day passing from the additional 48 hours is deemed a separate offense, which is 
liable to a fine. 
d. ?Fines will be deposited into the stormwater utility operating budget.

Sec. 78-634. - Stop work order. 
(a) ?In addition to the penalties, if land disturbance is conducted contrary to the provisions of this article 
or the accepted stormwater quality management plan, the city stormwater utility through the city 
engineer, and the city building and planning may order the work stopped by notice of a stop work 
order on any person engaged in the causing work; and any such persons shall stop the work until 
authorized by the city stormwater utility through the city building and planning to proceed with the 
work. A stop work order shall not be issued until after the initial 48 hour notice of violation. The city 
stormwater utility through the city department of public works may launch or cause to be launched, 
any necessary or advisable protective measures to prevent violations of this article or to reduce 
noncompliance. The cost of any such protective measures shall be the responsibility of the owner of 
the project upon which the work is being done and the responsibility of any person carrying out or 
participating in the work. 
(b) ?Any person who ignores or fails to comply with a stop work order shall be subject to a first offense 
fine of $250.00; subsequent offenses shall be subject to a fine that shall not exceed $2,500.00 per 
occurrence. Failure to comply with a stop work order, within three hours, revokes the existing 
building permit. A permit reinstatement fee of $50.00 will be assessed by the city stormwater utility 
and/or the city engineer. 
(Ord. No. 2018-01-01, 2-20-2018) 


Sec. 78-635. - Failure to comply or complete. 
    In addition to any other remedies, should any owner fail to comply with this article, the city

Sec. 78-636. - Suspension of access to the storm drain system. 
(a) ?Suspension due to emergency situations. The city stormwater utility and/or the city engineer may, 
without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage system discharge access to a person when such 
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present 
imminent and substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons, or to the environment. 
(b) ?Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the stormwater 
drainage system in violation of this article may have their stormwater drainage system access 
terminated if such termination would stop or reduce an illicit discharge. The city stormwater utility 
through the city engineer will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The 
violator may petition the city stormwater utility through the city board of works, and will receive the 
verdict after the next scheduled board of works meeting. 
(c) ?Suspension due to the damaging of the storm drain system within the development. Any person 
committing acts that result in damage to the stormwater drainage system that was approved for 
development will be held responsible for remediating damages. The corrective actions for 
remediation will be determined by the city board of works. The corrective actions could include but 
are not limited to remedies requiring financial investment. The project owner may have all of his/her 
approvals for the development revoked and denied access to any stormwater outlet for the 
development. 
(Ord. No. 2018-01-01, 2-20-2018) 


Sec. 78-637. - Corrective action. 
    Nothing in this document shall prevent the city stormwater utility through the city engineer from 
taking such other lawful actions as may be necessary to inhibit or remedy any violation. All costs 
connected shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. Costs include but are not limited to: repairs 
to the stormwater drainage system made necessary by the violation, penalties levied by the EPA or IDEM 
for violation of the city stormwater permit, attorney fees, and other costs and expenses.

Sec. 78-638. - Appeals. 
(a) ?An appeal may be filed contesting the first written notice issued to a contractor, developer and/or 
principal. If the appeal is not received by the city board of works within the 48 hour time frame given 
to remedy the violation, then the violator waives any right to appeal. The failure to appeal the initial 
notice of violation also waives any right to challenge a successive fine and/or stop work order. Any 
appeal made to stormwater utility shall be heard within 14 days. 
(b) ?Written appeals shall contain the following: 
(1) ?Identifying the matter being appealed; 
(2) ?Basis for the appeal. 
(c) ?The city board of works shall consider the appeal and make a decision affirming, rejecting or 
modifying the action being appealed. In considering any appeal, the city board of works may grant an 
deviation from the terms of this article to provide relief, in whole or in part, from the action being 
appealed. 
(d) ?The application of the article provisions being appealed will present or cause practical difficulties for 
a development site. However, that the practical difficulties shall not include the need for the appealer 
to utilize additional expenses in order to comply with the article. 
(e) ?The granting of the relief requested will not substantially prevent the goals and purposes of this 
article, nor result in less effective management of stormwater quality. 
(f) ?If the appeal is denied by the city board of works, the violator will be liable for the fines for the daily 
violation as provided for in this article.

ARTICLE 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 


1.0. - Purpose. 
    In order to promote the realization of the comprehensive plan of the City of Warsaw; in order to 
provide reasonable requirements for public streets, community facilities and other public grounds; in order 
to provide for the health, safety, comfort and convenience of the residents of the City of Warsaw; in order 
that developers of land may have a procedural guide, the following regulations establishing reasonable 
standards of design and procedure for subdivisions, and for resubdivisions of land and of areas subject to 
redevelopment within the City of Warsaw, are hereby adopted as part of the Comprehensive Plan of the 
City of Warsaw. 


1.1. - Authority. 
    This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authority granted to local government by IC 36-7-4-700 et 
seq. Authority for the administration of these regulations shall be vested in the plan commission of the 
City of Warsaw. No plat or replat of a subdivision of land located within the corporate limits of the city shall 
be filed with the auditor or recorded by the recorder of Kosciusko County until it shall have been approved 
by the Warsaw City plan commission, and such approval shall have been entered in writing on the plat by 
the president and secretary of the commission. 


1.2. - Jurisdiction. 
    These regulations shall apply to all subdivision and resubdivision of land within the corporate limits of 
the city, as now or hereafter established. 
1.21. ?No person shall subdivide or lay out into lots any land within the city, except in accordance 
with procedures and approvals as required herein. 
1.22. ?No building permit shall be issued for any parcel or plat of land created by subdivision that is 
not in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. 
1.23. ?No excavation of land or construction of any public or private improvements shall take place 
or be commenced for the purpose of creating a subdivision except in conformity with these 
regulations. 


1.3. - Title. 
    The regulations contained in this ordinance shall be referred to officially as "The Subdivision Control 
Ordinance of the City of Warsaw, Indiana," and the term "Regulations" or "Subdivision Regulations," when 
used in this ordinance, shall mean and shall have the force and effect of ordinance provisions of the City 
of Warsaw, Indiana. 


1.4. - Objectives and responsibility of subdivision regulation. 
1.41. ?The regulation of land subdivision has become widely recognized as a method of insuring sound 
community growth and the safeguarding of the interests of the home owner, the subdivider and the 
local government. The citizens of the city, as of all cities, need the assurance that residential 
subdivisions will provide permanent assets to the community. This article should be viewed not as an 
end in itself, but as one tool or technique for the shaping of urban land according to the 
comprehensive plan for the development of the community. 
1.42. ?The planning of the subdivision is the joint responsibility of the subdivider and the plan 
commission, the former having the prime responsibility for the creation of desirable, stable 
neighborhoods that become an integral part of the entire city. Subdivision design and utility can 
enhance or depreciate the character and potentialities of the surrounding areas and stabilize or 
endanger the individual's investment in a home. 
1.43. ?The plan commission has the responsibility of helping the subdivider achieve a high standard of 
excellence in the planning of his subdivision, and of informing all subdividers of the minimum 
standards and requirements on which the city will insist. 


1.5. - Relationship to referenced citations, plans and documents. 
    Whenever any provision of these regulations refers to or cites a section of the Indiana Code, as well 
as refers to any other codes, plans or documents, and the referenced code, plan or document is later 
amended or superseded, these regulations shall be deemed amended to refer to the amended section, or 
the section that most clearly corresponds to the superseded section.

ARTICLE 3. - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SUBDIVISION OF LAND 


3.0. - General criteria for acceptability. 
3.01. ?Conformance to comprebensive plan. The subdivision shall conform to the comprehensive plan or 
the portions thereof now existing, and shall not encroach upon areas designated in the 
comprehensive plan for future public facilities. 
3.02. ?Provision for future subdivision. If a tract is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building 
lots, such parcels shall be arranged to allow the opening of future streets and logical further 
subdivision. 
3.03. ?Reserve strips prohibited. There shall be no reservation of strips of land that prevent or limit 
access to land dedicated or intended to be dedicated to public use. 
3.04. ?Building sites. Every lot must contain a suitable building site. 
3.05. ?Landscaping. All subdivisions shall comply with article 13 of the Warsaw Zoning Ordinance. 
3.06. ?Conformance with thoroughfare plan. All proposed subdivisions shall conform to the thoroughfare 
plan, as is now or may be set forth hereafter. Whenever any tract to be subdivided embraces any 
part of said thoroughfare plan, such part of such public way shall be platted by the subdivider in the 
location and of the width indicated on the thoroughfare plan. Where streets are not shown in the 
thoroughfare plan, the arrangements of streets in a subdivision shall provide for the continuation or 
projection of existing principal streets in surrounding areas or, conform to a plan of the neighborhood 
approved and adopted by the plan commission. 
3.07. ?Variations and exceptions. Variations and exceptions from the design and dimensional standards 
and improvement requirements of these regulations may be made by the plan commission in cases 
where owing to exceptional conditions, there are extreme difficulties or hardships in the way of 
carrying out the strict letter of these regulations. Resubdivision of a single lot of a platted block of an 
old subdivision shall be considered as an exceptional condition meriting departure from the strict 
letter of these regulations. No variation or exception shall be made that will be detrimental to the 
public welfare or that will affect adversely the comprehensive plan. In addition, no variation or 
exception may be made by the plan commission which would violate or be contradictory to the 
requirements contained within the zoning ordinance, as well as, any other applicable statute or 
regulation. 


3.1. - Standards. 
3.11. ?Streets; general. The general criteria for street design shall be as follows: 
a. ?The arrangement, character, extension, width, grade and location of all streets shall be 
correlated to existing and planned streets, existing topography, public convenience and safety 
and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. 
b. ?Local streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic and high speed traffic will be 
discouraged. 
c. ?Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed principal arterial as shown 
in the thoroughfare plan, the plan commission shall require a marginal access street or reverse 
frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation which shall have a minimum 
width of ten feet along the rear property line; or, such other treatment as may be adequate for 
protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
d. ?Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, or limited access highway 
right-of-way, the plan commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each 
side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. 
Such distances shall be determined with due regard for the requirements of approved grades 
and future grade separation. 
e. ?Street jogs with centerfine offsets of less than 150 feet shall be prohibited.

feet, as measured from the centerline of the street of origin to the center point of the turnaround, 
nor have more than 30 lots with direct access to the cul-de-sac or dead-end street. All dead-end 
streets shall terminate in a circular right-of-way within a minimum radius of 50 feet with an 
effective turning radius of 40 feet. 
i. ?All street intersections shall, where possible, be made at 90 degrees, but in no case shall the 
acute angle be less than 80 degrees. 
j. ?No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing 
streets within the corporate limits of Warsaw. All street names proposed shall be subject to the 
city engineer/planner's approval. 
k. ?No more than two streets shall intersect at one point. 
l. ?The developer shall be responsible for placement of street name signs at all street intersections, 
as approved by the city engineer/planner.

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
State Law reference— Primary plat approval, IC 36-7-4-702 et seq. 


4.0. - Informal consideration. 
    From the standpoint of economy of time and money, it is highly recommended that the subdivider 
consult early and informally with the plan commission. This will enable the subdivider to become familiar 
with the requirements of these regulations as they affect the area and will permit the plan commission to 
determine conformity to the comprehensive plan, including the thoroughfare plan, the zoning ordinance 
and compliance with these regulations and with other city ordinances, not in conflict with these 
regulations, so as to prevent unnecessary and costly revisions. 
4.01. ?The subdivider shall be required to present a sketch in the form noted above for staff review 
prior to submitting an application for a preliminary plat. The purpose of this review is to acquaint 
the subdivider with applicable plans and ordinances, as well as, to make the subdivider aware 
of procedural and application requirements. The plan commission may consider the failure to 
present a sketch to staff prior to the submission of a preliminary plat as an improper form or an 
incomplete application and may not receive or consider the application until the staff review has 
occurred in accordance with the requirements set forth herein. 


4.1. - Application. 
    The procedure for submission of a preliminary plat shall be as follows: 
4.11. ?The subdivider shall submit a written application with payment of filing fee, together with ten

submit an electronic copy of the plat on computer disk in a format which is compatible to the 
current city computer system. 
4.12. ?The application shall specify the intent of the subdivider with respect to land use, drainage, 
sewage disposal and water supply. Where applicable, the application shall also specify the 
intent of the subdivider with respect to schools, recreation facilities, essential municipal services 
and street improvement proposed by the subdivider; the application shall also specify any 
existing restrictions or intended restrictions on the property to be subdivided, as well as the 
expected date of its development. 
4.13. ?The plan commission shall determine whether the application and the preliminary layout are 
in proper form and shall not receive or consider the application as filed until all documents are in 
accordance with the requirements set forth herein. 


4.2. - Consideration. 
    The plan commission will study the preliminary layout in connection with the comprehensive plan, 
including the thoroughfare plan, the zoning ordinance and the topography of the area, and will take into 
consideration the general requirements of the community, the particular requirements of the 
neighborhood, and the best use of the land to be subdivided. Particular attention will be given to specific 
requirements for parks, playgrounds, school sites, major streets, the adequacy of street connections and 
the suitability of the land for development. 


4.3. - Public hearing. 
    Upon receipt of an application for primary approval, the plan commission staff shall review the 
application for technical conformity with the standards fixed in this ordinance. Within 30 days after receipt, 
the staff shall announce the date for a hearing before the plan commission and provide notice in 
accordance with IC 36-7-4-706. The procedures for the setting of hearing dates and the conduct of 
hearings are determined by the plan commission as part of its rules of procedure.

next meeting and if they find all conditions to be satisfied, shall affix the commission's seal 
upon the plat indicating preliminary approval. The plat shall also be signed by one of the 
designated officials identified within this ordinance. 
4.423. ?If the applicant fails to resubmit the plat with the required changes or to request, in 
writing, an extension of time, the preliminary plat shall be considered as disapproved 
based upon the findings and conditions previously identified by the commission. 
4.43. ?Disapproval. If the plan commission disapproves the plat as submitted, it shall prepare 
written findings and set forth all of its reasons in the records of the meeting. These reasons shall

4.62. ?Use. All fees collected for the review and approval of subdivisions shall be credited to the 
general fund of the City of Warsaw. 


4.7. - Exempt parcels.

a street, the subdivider shall have the right to submit an application concurrently for preliminary and final 
plat approval. All of the information and submittals required for both the preliminary and final plats shall be 
submitted with the application for plat approval. In such case, the fee required by this ordinance shall be 
payable upon submission of the final plat. In the event a proposed subdivision involves the conveyance of 
portions of existing lots or parcels to other existing lots or parcels, the subdivision may be considered 
exempt and need not file an application for preliminary or final subdivision approval as restricted by the

APPENDIX B - ZONING[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— Printed herein is the city's zoning ordinance, as adopted by Ord. No. 98-4-1 on April 20, 
1998. Section 1 of Ord. No. 98-4-1 provided that chpater 25 of the city Code was replaced. The actual 
regulatory provisions attached to the ordinance were not formatted for the city Code and were not 
designated as a part of any section of Ord. No. 98-4-1. Amendments to the ordinance are indicated by 
parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the 
provision remains unchanged from the original ordinance. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors 
have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made 
uniform, and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes and expression of numbers in 
text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by 
brackets.

2.1. - Zoning maps. 
    The zoning map dated April 20, 1998, is hereby declared to be a part of this ordinance. The zoning 
map shows the areas included in the above districts. Notations, references, indications and other matters 
shown on the zoning maps are as much a part of this ordinance as if they were fully described in the text 
of this ordinance. Two copies of said zoning maps are on file in the office of the clerk-treasurer of the City 
of Warsaw, Indiana. 


2.2. - Determination and interpretation of district boundaries. 
    In determining the boundaries of districts, and establishing the regulation applicable to each district, 
due and careful consideration has been given to existing conditions; the character of buildings erected in 
each district; the most desirable use for which the land in each district may be adapted; and the 
conservation of property values throughout the city. The following rules shall apply where uncertainty 
exists as to the exact boundaries of any districts as shown on the zoning map: 
2.2.1. ?District boundaries are centerlines of street, alley, highway or railroad right-of-way, lot lines, 
or extensions along such lines, unless otherwise indicated on the zoning map. 
2.2.2. ?In unsubdivided areas, or where a boundary subdivides a lot, the exact location of the 
boundary shall be determined by use of the scale of the zoning map. The district regulations of 
either portion of the lot may, at the owner's discretion, extend into the entire area of the lot, 
provided such extension does not exceed a distance of 50 feet from either boundary. 
2.2.3. ?The plan commission shall interpret the intent of the zoning map and resolve any questions 
concerning the exact location of district boundary lines. 


2.3. - Procedure relating to annexed areas. 
    Territory which may hereafter be annexed to the city shall be zoned at the time of annexation in a 
city zone district which is similar or synonymous to the territory's zoning classification prior to annexation. 
A proposed zoning map for the annexed territory shall be made public prior to the annexation 
proceedings.

damaged by fire or other causes to the extent less than 75 percent of its appraised valuation must be 
reconstructed within a period not to exceed 12 months in order to continue to use such building devoted 
to a nonconforming use.

completed according to such plans, as filed within three years. 


4.6. - Use to conform after discontinuance.

set forth in the zoning ordinance, granted by the board of zoning appeals in accordance with the 
provisions of this ordinance where strict enforcement of the terms of the ordinance would create undue 
hardship, owing to the unique characteristics of the property for which the variance is sought. 
    Vision clearance on corner lots. A triangular space at the street corner of a corner lot, free from any 
kind of obstruction to vision between the height of 3½ and 12 feet above established grade, determined

ARTICLE 12. - ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS 


12.0. - Residential districts. 
    The residential district regulations are intended to govern the location, intensity and method of 
development of the residential area of the City of Warsaw. The regulations of each district are designed to 
provide for the protection of existing residential areas and to provide for new residential growth in the 
community. High and medium density residential development should relate directly to the central 
business district and to primary thoroughfares, linking these areas with industry and commercial centers. 
Lower density residential development should be located on the fringe or outlying areas. It is the intent of 
the ordinance to establish the following residential districts and regulations to implement and be 
consistent with the design and density objectives of the community.

13.1.4 ?Modifications. The board of zoning appeals may authorize, upon request, a reduction or 
waiver of the foregoing requirements if it should find that, in the particular case appealed, the 
peculiar nature of the business, trade, industrial or other use, or the exception shape or size of 
the property or other exceptional situation or condition, would justify such action. 


13.2. - Planned unit developments. 
13.2.1. ?Intent. The intent of this section is to permit more flexibility in a development through land use 
controls that foster good environmental design without violating the constitutional requirements of 
uniform classification and adequate standards; that permit planned residential developments in 
accordance with the master plan of the city; that permit a variety of housing accommodations 
including single-family detached, two-family and multifamily dwellings, and land uses in imaginative 
and orderly physical and aesthetic relationship to one another; that permit the grouping and 
preservation of open space, school sites, recreation areas and lands for other public, semipublic 
(including churches) and private purposes; that permit the development of an area rather than 
individual lot development. No particular development shall necessarily include all the requirements 
set forth above. Planned unit development (PUD) shall be permitted only in areas designated as 
PUD districts by adoption of a PUD district ordinance by the plan commission and common council in 
the same manner as a zone map change that is initiated under IC 36-7-4-602(c)(1)(B). A PUD district 
shall be subject to all requirements of IC 36-7-4-1500 series. The terms "development requirement," 
"planned unit development district" and "PUD district ordinance" shall have the same meaning in this 
ordinance as defined in IC 36-7-4-1501, 36-7-4-1502 and 36-7-4-1503. 
13.2.2. ?General requirements. The general requirements for planned unit developments are as follows: 
13.2.2.1. ?The tract proposed shall consist of one or more contiguous parcels of land comprising an 
area of four acres or more in size, unless the tract be bounded on all sides by public rights-of-
way, public lands, watercourses, or less restrictive use districts, in which case it may be smaller 
than four acres. 
13.2.2.2. ?The major use of the tract shall be residential, and may include single-family, two-family 
and multifamily dwellings and the usual accessory uses such as garages, storage space and 
community activities. 
13.2.2.3. ?The tract may contain commercial and professional uses as an integral part of a 
residential development; but such uses shall be planned and gauged primarily for the service 
and convenience of residents of the planned development, and shall be authorized only to the 
extent that such uses are not available to the residents within a reasonable proximity. 
13.2.2.4. ?Planned residential developments shall be designed to create environments of stable 
and desirable character; they must provide provisions for recreation space adequate to meet 
the needs of the anticipated population or as designated in the master plan. 
13.2.2.5. ?The tract must be served directly by streets of appropriate size, function and capacity. 
13.2.2.6. ?There shall be no minimum lot sizes, no minimum setbacks, no maximum lot coverage, 
no minimum lot widths and no height limitations. 
13.2.2.7. ?All buildings shall be served by an adequate public sewer system, water supply and other 
utilities. 
13.2.2.8. ?Street right-of-way and pavement widths, if approved by the plan commission, may be 
reduced; however, every dwelling unit and all other uses shall have access to a public street, 
court, walkway or other area dedicated to public use. 
13.2.2.9. ?All parking lots, open spaces and other areas in common ownership shall be maintained 
properly by the developer, management or homeowners' association. 
13.2.2.10. ?Provisions for open space, compensating for the reduced lot sizes, setbacks, etc., shall 
be made by the developer. 
13.2.3. ?Procedure. An applicant for a PUD district shall first consult the office of the plan commission, 
and submit two copies of a proposed development plan as prepared in accordance with section 13.6 
of this ordinance for all of the land to be included in the PUD district. In addition to the requirements 
contained in this section and the requirements contained in the PUD district ordinance, the proposed 
development in a PUD district must also comply with the other requirements of this ordinance. 
    Upon conclusion of the consultation prescribed by section 13.6, the administrator shall note in writing 
on the development plan his unofficial agreement or disagreement with the development plan. If the 
administrator's disagreement is noted, a statement of the administrator's reasons for disagreement shall 
be attached to the development plan. One copy of the development plan shall be kept by the 
administrator, and one copy shall be returned to the developer. 
    Upon the return of the development plan, the applicant for a PUD district may then submit a PUD 
district application to the Warsaw plan commission (plan commission). The application shall comply with 
section 13.6. and be submitted with ten copies of the development plan which shall include a detailed site 
plan, as required under section 13.6 of this ordinance; proposed written commitments, if any; a statement 
indicating financial responsibility sufficient in light of the proposed public improvements shown on the 
development plan; and all of the supporting documents which may reasonably be required, from time to 
time, by the plan commission. 
    In considering the development plan and the formation of the PUD district ordinance, the plan 
commission shall pay due regard to the requirements of IC 36-7-4-603. The commission shall also 
carefully consider the development plan and the recommendations of the administrator. 
    The plan commission shall then provide notice and conduct a public hearing pursuant to the terms of 
IC 36-7-4-604. After the public hearing, the plan commission shall certify the application and development 
plan to the commissioners with a favorable recommendation, and unfavorable recommendation or no 
recommendation. A copy of the development plan shall be retained by the plan commission office, one 
copy shall be forwarded to the common council, and one copy furnished to the applicant. If a favorable 
recommendation was given by the plan commission, the development plans so delivered shall be 
stamped "conditionally approved development plan" and be signed by the officers of the plan commission. 
    The plan commission's recommendations shall be recorded in the minutes of the plan commission 
meeting, together with a finding as to whether the proposed development is consistent with the spirit and 
intent of the comprehensive plan of the City of Warsaw. Approval of the development plan and the PUD 
district ordinance shall follow the procedures required under section 13.6, development plan procedures. 
The plan commission's recommendation shall also state: 
a. ?Whether the development plan states all development requirements in detailed terms, whether 
the development requirements as stated are acceptable to the plan commission and whether 
the PUD district ordinance should be eligible for final approval; or 
b. ?Whether the development plan states the development requirements in general terms and 
secondary review and approval should be required. In the event the plan commission 
recommends secondary review, the recommendation also (i) may specify the general 
development requirements for which additional detail must be provided, (ii) may state limits or 
parameters, if any, for the satisfaction of any or all of the general development requirements, 
and (iii) shall specify any plan documentation or supporting information that must be supplied in 
connection with secondary review. 
    The minutes and the recommendations included in them shall be filed with the commissioners. 
Within ten business days after the plan commission determines its recommendation, the plan commission 
shall certify its proposal to the common council pursuant to IC 36-7-4-605 and 36-7-4-608. 
    Upon receipt of the certified proposal under section 602.6 of this ordinance, the common council 
shall vote on the proposal within 90 days. The common council shall approve, deny or amend the 
proposal pursuant to IC 36-7-4-608 and shall not be bound by the plan commission's recommendations. 
    Any final approval of a PUD district ordinance by the common council must express either in general 
or in detailed terms the development requirements that apply to the PUD district. If the common council 
find that the development requirements are expressed in detailed terms and adopt the PUD district 
ordinance on such basis, there shall be no secondary review and no authority delegated under this 
ordinance. The development requirements which must be addressed by the council are those listed in IC 
36-7-4-1403. It shall be sufficient for the council to note that a development requirement for a PUD is as 
shown on the approved development plan. The council's approval of a PUD district ordinance must also 
specify any plan documentation or supporting information that must be supplied to the administrator either 
before an improvement location permit may be issued for development of real property in the PUD district, 
or with an application for secondary review. 
SECONDARY REVIEW 
    If the PUD district ordinance adopted by the council expresses in general terms the development 
requirements, this section shall apply. The PUD district ordinance may express criteria in general terms 
for the development requirements. 
    If the council chooses to approve the expression of the development requirements in general terms 
for the PUD district, the secondary review requirements contained in this section shall apply. The council 
shall determine whether to retain secondary review or delegate it pursuant to the terms of this ordinance. 
If the council chooses to delegate secondary review, it shall be delegated to the plan commission and 
conducted as follows: 
a. ?Secondary review shall commence with the submission of plan documentation and supporting 
information to the plan commission by the owners of at least 50 percent of the real estate in the 
PUD district. The plan documentation and supporting information shall comply with the 
requirements of this ordinance, the PUD district ordinance, or rules adopted by the plan 
commission pursuant to IC 35-7-4-1511(j). The plan documentation and supporting information 
must be sufficient to allow the plan commission to ensure that the applicable development 
requirements expressed in general terms are satisfied, and that the applicable requirements in 
this ordinance are satisfied. 
b. ?Within 30 days of receipt of all required plan documentation and supporting information, the plan 
commission shall schedule the secondary review for public hearing and give notice in 
accordance with IC 36-7-4-604(b). When conducting its secondary review, the plan commission 
shall consider the general development requirements contained in the PUD district ordinance. If 
the applicable development requirements and the applicable provisions of this ordinance have 
been satisfied, the plan commission shall grant secondary approval of the PUD district 
ordinance. The plan commission's approval shall be in writing, and shall include the following: 
1. ?Any development requirements, which shall be expressed in detailed terms, in addition to 
those adopted by the commissioners; and 
2. ?A detailed list of any plan documentation or supporting information which must be supplied 
before an improvement location permit may be issued for any development of real estate 
property in the PUD district. 
3. ?Any decision made by the plan commission pursuant to this section or pursuant to section 
13.6 shall be appealable to the council. Such appeal must be brought within 30 days of the 
plan commission's final decision by providing written notice of such appeal to the plan 
commission. Such notice shall contain the specific basis for the appeal. Those persons 
entitled to an appeal shall be the Applicant or landowners contained in the area to be 
covered by the PUD district ordinance or an interested property owner located adjacent to 
such area. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the council shall then schedule the appeal 
for its next regularly scheduled public meeting at which it will conduct a public hearing 
regarding the appeal. Notice of the appeal shall be given in the same manner as the notice 
required pursuant to IC 5-3-1. After the public hearing is concluded, the council shall make 
a final determination regarding the appeal, which decision shall be final. 
    Pursuant to IC 36-7-4-1509(d), if the applicable development requirements are expressed in general 
terms and the applicable requirements in this ordinance are satisfied, the secondary approval and other 
necessary permits shall be granted. 
MODIFICATIONS/AMENDMENTS 
    A PUD district ordinance may be modified, including the permitted uses or development 
requirements contained in the PUD district ordinance, by application filed by the property owners of at 
least 50 percent of the land which comprises the PUD district. The application shall be accompanied by 
supporting documents sufficient to accurately depict the portion of the original PUD district ordinance 
which the applicant desires to modify. 
    Within 30 days of receipt of the application to modify the PUD district ordinance, the plan 
commission shall provide notice and conduct a public hearing regarding the proposed modifications or 
amendments pursuant to the procedures contained in IC 36-7-4-604 for notice and public hearing. The 
decision of the plan commission regarding any modifications or amendments of a PUD district ordinance 
shall be appealable to the council pursuant to the same procedure for secondary review in section 13.6 of 
this ordinance. 
    Pursuant to IC 36-7-4-1511(l), the council shall, upon request of the applicant, state in the PUD 
district ordinance, that certain modifications or amendments are minor and may be made without a public 
hearing. 
LIMITATIONS ON PUD DISTRICTS 
    The PUD district may contain residential, commercial, industrial, professional or special exceptions 
as an integral part of the PUD district. The PUD district ordinance adopted by the council shall specify the 
uses or range of uses permitted in the PUD district. All special exceptions shall require approval of the 
board of zoning appeals pursuant to this ordinance and applicable state statute, unless such special use 
is expressly permitted in the PUD district ordinance. 
    The land involved in an application under this article for a PUD district must be either in one 
ownership or the subject of an application filed by the property owners who own at least 50 percent of the 
land involved in the application. 
    In approving a PUD district ordinance, the plan commission and the commissioners shall consider 
the intent and principles of the comprehensive plan, the compatibility of the development with the 
surrounding land uses, the availability and coordination of water, sanitary sewers, storm drainage, and 
other utilities, the management of traffic in a manner that creates conditions favorable to health, safety, 
convenience and the harmonious development of the community, and any adverse effects to the property 
of public facilities in the area. 
    The development plan submitted with an application for a PUD district must be designed in 
accordance with accepted engineering practice, and must comply with the requirements in section 13.6, 
development plan procedures. 
    When adopting or amending a PUD district ordinance, the commissioners may impose reasonable 
conditions which may include any of the following: 
a. ?A financial guarantee that satisfactory maintenance will be provided for any common facilities, 
and that the facilities will be operated and maintained at no expense to the City of Warsaw or 
any other governmental unit. 
b. ?The furnishing of a bond or a satisfactorily written assurance guaranteeing the timely completion 
of proposed public improvements. 
c. ?Allowing or requiring an owner of real estate property in the PUD district to make a written 
commitment in a manner authorized under IC 36-7-4-615. 
ISSUANCE OF IMPROVEMENT LOCATION PERMIT 
    No improvement location permit or certificate of occupancy may be issued unless all requirements, 
conditions and specifications required by the PUD district ordinance and this article have been met. In 
order to obtain an improvement location permit for any portion of the real estate included in the PUD 
district, the owner of such real estate, which may be less than all of the real estate included in the PUD 
district, shall submit to the administrator the plan documentation and supporting information required by 
this ordinance, the PUD district ordinance, and, if applicable, the plan commission or council as a result of 
secondary review of the PUD district ordinance. 
13.2.4. ?Effective time of approval. Approval of the development plan by the plan commission shall be 
effective for a period of 12 months. Within this period of time, the owner shall file for preliminary plat 
approval or the development plan shall become null and void. 
13.2.5. ?Preliminary plat submission. The owner shall submit a preliminary plat to the plan commission in 
conformance with the procedures set forth in the subdivision regulations. 
13.2.5.1. ?All regulations for preliminary plat submissions as contained in the subdivision 
regulations shall be adhered to except those regulations concerning lot size, setbacks, lot 
coverage, lot widths, building heights and street widths and rights-of-way which have previously 
been exempted by the plan commission as part of the development plan. 
13.2.6. ?Final plat submission. The submission of a final plat for all or any portion of the preliminary plat 
shall be in accordance with the procedures as set forth for a final plat in the subdivision regulations. 
13.2.7. ?Designation binding successors in interest. Whenever a tract of land has been designated as a 
planned unit development, such destination shall continue in effect irrespective of subsequent 
changes in ownership, whether all or a portion of the designated tract; and the uses and regulations 
approved shall bind and be applicable to any successors in interest to those who were the owners of 
such tract at the time of the designation as a planned unit development.

13.3. - Screening and landscape standards. 
    A landscape buffer is a unit of yard together with the planting thereon. Both the amount of land and 
the type and amount of planting specified for each landscape screen requirement are designed to 
minimize nuisances between adjacent land uses. The requirements established herein for the installation 
and maintenance of landscaping and screening are deemed necessary to protect and enhance the 
community's environmental, economic and aesthetic quality, thereby contributing to the overall objective 
of promoting the public health, safety and welfare. More specifically, it is the purpose of this ordinance to: 
Aid in stabilizing the environment's ecological balance by contributing to the process of air 
purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater recharge and the accommodation of stormwater 
runoff; 
Aid in abatement of noise, glare, heat and dust; 
Promote energy conservation and personal comfort by maximizing the cooling effects of vegetation; 
Help delineate separation of spaces and activities, thereby reducing visual and functional conflicts 
between land uses and activity areas associated with a site; 
Enhance community appearance, identity and unique natural beauty; 
Create visual interest, variety and harmony and provide contrast and relief from the built-up 
environment; 
Protect and enhance property values; 
Establish the minimum landscaping and screening standards and criteria that are necessary to 
achieve the desired quality of life described by the purposes set forth above. 
13.3.1. ?Location, maintenance, planting size, and landscape 
plan. 
a. ?Landscape buffers shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending to 
the lot or parcel boundary line. Landscape buffers shall not be located on any portion of an 
existing or dedicated public or private street right-of-way or drainage and utility easements. 
b. ?The owner, tenant and their respective agents, if any, shall jointly and severally be 
responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping. This shall include, but not limited to, 
pruning, fertilizing, watering, mowing, weeding, and other such activities necessary to the 
proper maintenance of landscaping. All plant material which dies shall be replaced with 
plant material of required size, within 30 days ot the plant material's death. This period may 
be extended if weather conditions inhibit installation of new plant materials. Any masonry 
walls, chainlink and wrought iron fences shall be erected and maintained in conformance 
with all local code and ordinances. 
c. ?A landscape plan shall be submitted to the plan department when a development plan is 
required or at the time of preliminary platting of single-family or duplex subdivisions, or 
prior to receiving a building permit. The landscape plan shall be prepared by a landscape 
architect, professional engineer or architect registered and licensed in the State of Indiana. 
Plans shall be prepared on a standard size drawing sheet and contain the following 
information in addition to that required by section 13.6, development plan requirements. 
1. ?Existing trees six inches in caliper. 
2. ?The location of required screening and plant material by common name, scientific 
name, size and quantity. 
13.3.1.1. ?Opaque wall, barrier or fence: Where opaque walls, barriers or fences are 
used, such screens shall conform to the following: 
a. ?Materials used shall be of good condition, properly installed and consist of wood, 
masonry, "basket-weave" chainlink fence or any combination thereof or any other 
acceptable building materials. 
b. ?Such materials shall bear no signs or advertising, other than the name of the 
premises. 
13.3.2. ?Determination of landscape buffer requirements. To determine the type of landscape buffer 
required between two adjacent parcels or between a parcel and a street, the following 
procedure shall be followed: 
a. ?Identify the zoning district of the proposed land use by referring to the vertical column of 
the Table of Required Landscape Buffers. 
b. ?Identify the zoning district of the existing, adjacent land use by referring to the horizontal 
column of the Table of Required Landscape Buffers. 
c. ?Determine the landscape buffer required on each boundary of the subject parcel by 
referring to the Table of Required Landscape Buffers and then to the requirements for that 
landscape buffer. 
13.3.3. ?Landscape buffer requirements. The following types of landscape buffers are required in 
addition to those listed on the Table of Required Landscape Buffers: 
a. ?Vehicle loading areas. Vehicle loading areas shall be screened from public roads and 
adjacent residential districts where the yard containing the loading area is adjacent to the 
roadway or residential district. Screening shall be landscape buffer type A as described in 
Table 7. 
b. ?Nonresidential outdoor storage areas. Where outdoor storage areas are located within a 
yard which is adjacent to a residential district or public street, screening of such storage 
area shall meet the requirement of landscape buffer A described in Table 7. 
c. ?Nonresidential and multifamily residential surface parking areas. A minimum of five percent 
of the total parking area shall be landscaped. Such landscaping shall be distributed within 
the parking area, occurring within medians, islands or peninsulas. One tree shall be 
provided for each ten parking spaces and shall be located in such a manner that no 
parking space is further than 100 feet from a tree. Parking areas shall be screened from 
public streets and adjacent residential districts. Screening shall meet the requirement of 
landscape buffer type D described in Table 7. 
d. ?Nonresidential and multifamily refuse storage areas. Refuse storage containers shall be 
screened from public streets and adjacent residential districts by a six-foot high screen. 
Where they are not entirely screened from these areas by meeting the requirements of 
other sections, they shall be screened on three sides by the construction of permanent 
opaque wooden or masonry screens. An opening shall be provided on the fourth side for 
access by refuse collectors. However the opening shall be situated so that the container is 
not visible at an angle greater than 45 degrees from adjacent public streets. Such openings 
shall have a minimum width of 12 feet to accommodate refuse collection. 
13.3.4. ?Preservation of existing trees and natural landscape. Preservation of existing trees and 
natural landscape features shall be encouraged. 
a. ?When the location of existing trees in a healthy and growing condition or significant natural 
landscape features impedes strict compliance with the standards set forth herein, then the 
submittal of an alternative landscape and screening plan which incorporates such existing 
features into the overall site design is encouraged. 
b. ?Existing trees may be used to fulfill tree planting requirements if such trees are in a healthy 
and growing condition and if they are included on the plant list set forth in this section. The 
planning director may approve existing trees which are not included on the plant list as part 
of the landscape plan upon determining that the tree is of an appropriate size and variety. 
c. ?Existing trees used to fulfill tree planting requirements shall be protected by barricades or 
other acceptable methods during site preparation and construction to provide the area 
defined by the limits of the dripline of the canopy of the tree. A minimum of 75 percent of 
the protected area shall be maintained as a permanent permeable landscape area at 
grades existing prior to site development. 
13.3.5. ?Visibility. Where rigid enforcement of these standards creates a conflict with the provisions 
of blind corner regulations, the blind corner regulation shall take precedence and the landscape 
buffer standard shall be reduced to the extent necessary to alleviate the conflict.

To prohibit signs not expressively permitted by this article; and 
To provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this article. 
    Applicability. A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created or maintained in the city

with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or 
combination thereof, that will encompass the extreme limits of the sign (as defined above), but not 
including any supporting framework, bracing, or structure that is clearly incidental to the display itself. 
    Computation of area of multi-faced signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be 
computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign 
faces are placed back-to-back, so that both sign faces cannot be viewed at the same time, and when 
such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area 
shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. 
    Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the 
sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be 
construed to be the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, beaming, 
mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. 
    Computation of total permitted sign area per frontage. The total sign area that is oriented toward a 
particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's total sign area allocation that is derived from the 
lot, building, or wall area frontage on that street. 
13.4.3. ?General provisions. All signs in all districts are subject to the regulations in this section. Any 
sign identified by multiple definitions is subject to all provisions of each identified definition. 
a. ?Unless otherwise noted, all signs erected in the City of Warsaw shall require a permit from the 
Warsaw Planning Department. 
b. ?All signs shall be constructed, connected, operated and maintained according to the applicable 
provisions of the Uniform Building Code and the electrical codes of the City of Warsaw. 
c. ?All signs shall be maintained in good repair and in safe, neat, attractive, and structurally sound 
condition. Painted faces or structural members shall be repainted whenever peeling or fading 
occurs. Neon tubes, lamps, ballasts and transformers shall be kept in a good state of repair and 
in safe condition. The city may order the removal of any sign which becomes a public hazard 
due to lack of maintenance or repair. 
d. ?Permits required for existing signs. If a sign requiring a permit under the provision of this article 
is to be replaced, constructed, or erected on a zone lot, the owner of the lot shall secure a sign 
permit prior to construction, placement, or erection of such a sign. 
1. ?Furthermore, the property owner shall maintain in force, at all times, a sign permit for such 
sign. 
2. ?Repair and regular maintenance of signs, (conforming and legal non-conforming) does not 
require a permit provided the cost of work does not exceed 50 percent of the value of the 
sign. 
e. ?A legal nonconforming sign can be modified provided the modifications conform to this article. 
f. ?Continuation of nonconforming signs. The lawful use of a sign existing at the time of passage of 
this article may be continued although such sign does not conform to all provisions of this 
article, except as herein provided.

discontinued for a period of one year, the sign shall be made to conform to the permitted 
regulations.

property line. 
m. ?All lit signs shall conform to existing lighting regulations. 
n. ?Directional signs shall not exceed six square feet in area and four feet in height and shall not 
count toward the sign allowance for a site. 
o. ?Drive through signs can be put on one permit and will not count toward the sign allowance for a 
site. 
p. ?Real estate signs. A sign indicating that a property or any portion thereof is available for 
inspection, sale, lease, rent, or directing people to a property. Directional signs may not contain 
any advertising of any kind. They may only contain the street address and common phrases 
including the words, "for sale," "for lease," "for rent."

sign usage is by a not-for-profit organization or if the signs are placed in a window. 
i. ?Each day a violation of this section occurs shall constitute a separate violation of this subsection. 
j. ?No temporary sign shall be placed in any portion of the public right-of-way nor shall they be so 
placed as to obstruct the view of vehicular or pedestrian traffic at intersections or points of 
ingress and egress onto a public right-of-way. 
k. ?No sign originally manufactured, constructed or intended for use as a temporary sign shall be 
used as a permanent sign nor shall any temporary sign be converted to use as a permanent 
sign. Because of the added structural needs of permanent mounted signs, and the usual lack of 
a proper internal structure in temporary signs, they may not become permanent signs, and no 
sign permit will be issued for such installation. 
l. ?For businesses whose primary business is conducted outside, these special provisions shall 
apply to temporary signs: 
1. ?Moving signs may be used with a required setback of five feet from public right-of-way. 
This includes banners, flags, and streamers. A permit shall not be required for this

or confuse traffic. 
e. ?Signs erected on or attached to any sidewalk, street, tree lawn, tree, curb, curbstone, hydrant, 
lamppost, barricade, temporary walkway, utility pole, public fence, or on a fixture of the fire alarm or 
police system except public service signs. 
f. ?Inflatable signs, except as provided herein. 
g. ?Moving signs, except as provided herein. 
h. ?Off-premise signs. Real estate signs and development signs are exempt from this provision.

13.4.5. ?Administration. No sign, permanent or temporary, shall be erected or altered except in 
accordance with the provisions as set forth in section 13.4. 
a. ?The following signs shall not require permits: 
Ordinary maintenance and repair to existing signs, provided that such work does not affect the 
structure to a degree greater than 50 percent of the current replacement cost, exclusive of the 
structural support of the sign. 
Change of copy on signs. 
Repainting and posting of copy. 
Seasonal decorations and displays. 
Flags. 
Construction signs. 
Real estate signs. 
Public information signs. 
Sidewalk signs. 
Street signs erected by a subdivider or by the municipality for the purpose of street 
identification. 
13.4.6. ?Application. Application for sign permits shall be made through the city planner's office and shall 
include a site plan that includes the following information: 
a. ?Location of the building, structure or land to or on which the sign is to be erected. 
b. ?The dimensions of the sign and, where applicable, the dimensions of the wall surface of the 
building to which it is to be attached. 
c. ?The dimensions of the sign's structural members. 
d. ?The proposed location of the sign in relation to the face of the building or the lot lines of the 
property on which it is to be located, whichever is applicable. 
e. ?The owner shall agree to maintain the sign by repainting peeled and fading surfaces and 
replacing inoperative components; and to remove the sign when the use of the property and 
sign has been terminated. Should the owner fail to maintain the sign as outlined above within a 
reasonable time, the city shall cause the sign to be removed at the owner's expense after 
having given the owner of the sign 30 days' written notice to do so. 
f. ?Other such applicable information as the city planner's office may require under the provisions of 
this article. 
g. ?A sign permit fee shall accompany the application for a permit and shall be paid in accordance 
with the fee schedule in effect at the time of application. 
13.4.7. ?Procedure. The city planner's office shall review an application for a sign permit for compliance 
with this article and issue such permit or reject in writing such application. 
a. ?A sign permit shall be valid prior to actual placement of the sign for a period not exceeding three 
months; provided, however, that when a sign permit is issued in connection with a building 
permit for the site on which the sign is to be located, the sign permit shall run concurrent with 
the building permit. The holder of a sign permit may apply through the city planner's office for a 
three-month extension on the permit, if the sign has not been erected upon expiration of the 
permit, within 15 working days of the expiration date. A sign permit shall be renewed only once, 
after which time the permit shall be null and void. 
13.4.8. ?Inspection. 
a. ?The building commissioner shall have the right of entry in order to inspect all signs for 
compliance with the provisions of local codes and ordinances. 
b. ?When any sign becomes insecure, in danger of falling, or otherwise unsafe, the building 
commissioner shall send written notice to the owner of the sign to remove, change, or alter the 
sign. If said sign is not so removed, changed or altered within ten working days, the building 
commissioner shall cause the sign to be removed at the expense of the owner of the sign. 
13.4.9. ?Enforcement. 
a. ?Notice of complaint. When the city planner's office becomes aware of a violation of this article, 
the violation will be documented. Attempts will be made to contact the owner of the property at 
which the violation is occurring. When contact is made, the city planner's office will attempt to 
resolve the violation. If the property owner is non-responsive or not cooperative, the city 
planner's office will send a notice of hearing. 
b. ?Notice of hearing. A notice of hearing shall serve as official notification to the property owner to 
attend a code hearing to resolve the code violation.

13.5. - Fences. 
    It is the intent of this section to set forth regulations and general provisions for the construction and 
maintenance of fences that are consistent with the spirit, purpose and intent of this chapter; that will not 
substantially and permanently injure the appropriate use of neighboring property; and will substantially 
serve the public convenience and welfare. 
13.5.1. ?Definition. For the purpose of the fence regulations as contained in this section a "fence" is a 
structure. 
13.5.2. ?Regulations and intent. It is recognized that in many instances it is desirable to have fences. It 
is the intent of this section to encourage the beneficial use of fencing in order to create a more 
attractive environment. It is further the intent of this section to foster and improve the vitality of the 
community by enhancing and protecting the physical appearance of the community. In order to 
accomplish this purpose, it is necessary to regulate the size, location, construction and appearance 
of fences as set forth in this article. 
13.5.2.1. ?General provisions. 
a. ?All fences shall be constructed of uniform material, color and height; provided, however, 
that all other provisions of this chapter must be adhered to. 
b. ?All fencing shall be maintained in a good state of repair. Painted fences shall be repainted 
whenever peeling or uneven fading or streaking occurs. The city may order the removal of 
any fence which becomes a public hazard due to lack of maintenance or repair. 
c. ?All fencing shall be erected so as to place the good side of the fence facing away from the 
property owner erecting the fence. For the purpose of this ordinance "good side" shall 
mean that side of the fence which is the smoothest and reveals to the least extent the 
support members of the fence. 
d. ?Easements . The City of Warsaw shall not be responsible for fences removed or damaged 
as a result of placement in an easement. The fence owner shall acknowledge upon 
signature of a fence permit that a fence or other private property placed in an easement 
may be removed at any time and shall not be subject to reimbursement. 
1. ?Fence permits are subject to review by the city stormwater department. 
e. ?Total fence height shall include, but not be limited to, man-made mounding and support 
structures, and shall not include decorative post tops. 
f. ?Fences must meet the vision and clearance restrictions in section 3.5 of this appendix and 
at no time shall be in the public right-of-way. 
g. ?No fence shall be used as or for the display of a sign except as provided in section 13.4. 
13.5.2.2. ?Requirements by district. The following fencing regulations shall apply in the appropriate 
zoning districts as set forth below: 
a. ?RR-1, R-1, R-2, R-3. Residential districts as follows: 
1. ?No setback requirements on side or rear property lines, provided property is not 
bordered by an alley or other public easement. 
2. ?No fence to exceed six feet in height. 
3. ?No fence may be erected closer to an alley than three feet; provided, however, vision 
requirements must be met at all intersections with streets or other alleys as provided 
in section 3.5 of this ordinance. 
b. ?C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5. Commercial districts as follows: 
1. ?Except as required to meet section 13.3, no fence shall exceed six feet in height. 
2. ?No fence shall be used as or for the display of a sign except as provided in section 
13.4. 
3. ?All setback requirements as required for a structure unless a setback variance is 
granted by the board of zoning appeals. 
c. ?I-1, I-2, I-3. Industrial districts as provided in this ordinance and the following: 
1. ?Except as required to meet [section] 13.3, no fence shall exceed eight feet in height. 
2. ?No fence shall be used as or for the display of a sign except as provided in [section] 
13.4. 
3. ?No setback requirements except as required for vision or clearance as provided in 
[section] 3.5 of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2006-06-02, § 3, 6-5-2006; Ord. No. 2015-05-02, § 3, 6-1-2015)

be provided by furnishing a copy of its written findings and decision to the applicant 
and to such remonstrators of other interested parties, if any, as the commission may

(h) ?Primary approval of a development plan by the commission shall be valid for one 
year from the date of approval, unless the applicant, prior to the expiration of such 
one-year period, shall have applied for and received the commission's approval for an 
extension of time to obtain secondary approval. If by the expiration of such initial one-
year period of time, or during any period of extension approved by the commission, 
the applicant does not obtain secondary approval of all or part of the area included, in 
the development plan for which primary approval had been granted, then the primary 
approval granted for the development plan shall lapse, and be considered as null and 
void. In the event the commission grants secondary approval for only a portion of the 
development plan, the applicant thereafter will not be obligated to adhere to any time 
limitations for requesting secondary approval of the remainder of the development 
plan. 
13.6.2. ?Secondary approval of development plans. 
a. ?Secondary approval of development plans; procedure and 
conditions. 
1. ?Procedure. 
(a) ?The applicant shall have the responsibility to notify the director of the commission of 
his intent to seek secondary approval, of either all or a portion of the development 
plan. In the event the applicant intends to seek secondary approval of only a portion of 
the development plan, the applicant shall specifically describe and designate such 
area so as to reasonably identify the same. The applicant shall also at that time file 
with the commission staff the development plan in the form and with the contents 
prescribed hereinafter. The director shall then cause to be scheduled a meeting of the 
commission for the purpose of reviewing the development plan and determining 
whether secondary approval shall be granted, and provide notice to the applicant of 
the date and time of such meeting. No other notice of such meeting need be given, 
except as required by law. The commission staff shall then review all submissions 
made by the applicant to insure the requirements for secondary approval stated in this 
ordinance have been satisfied and make a recommendation to the commission for the 
granting or denial of secondary approval of the development plan. 
2. ?Conditions. The commission will consider secondary approval of a development plan only 
after the applicant has accomplished all of the following: 
(a) ?Filed with the commission a complete set of plans and specifications for the 
development of all streets, sewers, water supply and other utilities and facilities 
proposed to be installed in conjunction with the development plan, in accordance with 
the requirements of this ordinance; 
(b) ?Furnished to the commission satisfactory evidence that the sewer and water facilities 
proposed to serve the development will be timely provided by the applicable 
governmental or quasipublic agency: 
(1) ?Furnished to the commission all necessary approvals and acceptances from all 
applicable agencies and authorities; 
(2) ?Provided evidence that he has complied with notice requirements under this 
ordinance or by rule, of the granting of primary approval of the development plan 
by the commission; and 
(3) ?Filed with the commission the development plan in the form and with the 
contents prescribed by this ordinance. 
b. ?Form and contents of development plan for secondary approval. 
1. ?Site plan and supporting maps. The development plan for which secondary approval is 
sought shall be submitted to the commission in the form of an original mylar or similar 
material drawn in ink and shall be a complete and accurate layout of the project and shall 
contain any and all additions, corrections, and deletions required by the commission. Such 
development plan shall also include the following information: 
(a) ?Date, scale (graphic and written), north point, name and address of the designer 
and/or engineer, name and address of the developer of the tract, and name of 
development; 
(b) ?Dimensions of the boundaries of the tract including bearings and distances and the 
exact location of all existing and recorded streets intersecting the boundary of the 
tract; 
(c) ?Section or reserve lines or other legal points of reference and distances to same; 
(d) ?Building lines, lot lines, easement locations and dimensions; 
(e) ?Lot numbers and individual addresses for each lot; 
(f) ?Plans, profiles, cross sections and names, location and geometric for streets and 
entrances onto public rights-of-way, including acceleration-deceleration and passing 
lanes, and dedication documents when applicable; 
(g) ?Plans and cross sections for pedestrian walkways; 
(h) ?Easements, such as pedestrian, utility, drainage, etc.; 
(i) ?Sanitary and storm sewer plans and profiles, and water line plans; 
(j) ?Parking areas, including plans, cross sections, and landscaping details; 
(k) ?The length of all arcs and radii, central angles, internal angles, points of curvature 
and tangency, the length of all tangents, intersection radii and right-of-way widths; 
(l) ?Lighting plan, including areas to be lighted, the type of fixtures to be used, and the 
lighting intensity level for all areas to be lighted, when required; 
(m) ?Landscape plans, including the location of all landscape materials and elements, 
which requirement is waived in those areas used for single-family residential 
purposes; and 
(n) ?Such other data which may be required by the commission. 
2. ?[Additional supporting data.] The applicant shall also furnish to the commission the 
supporting data, information and documents described below at the time the development 
plan is submitted for secondary approval: 
(a) ?Legal description of the parcel of real estate for which secondary approval is sought; 
(b) ?Any restrictive covenant, declaration, written commitment, or other document(s) 
related to the development, which is to be, or has been, recorded; 
(c) ?Traverse closure; 
(d) ?Construction performance schedule and accompanying development plan indicating 
delineations of specific areas. Those areas required to have open space shall include 
the time of the development of recreational or other facilities within the open space. 
The development plan shall also indicate the location of any construction access 
roads and their relationship to the staging of development; 
(e) ?Letters from the utilities serving the area with wastewater disposal and/or fresh water 
supplies, setting forth their ability to service the development; 
(f) ?If streets have been approved by the commission as private streets, such information 
and documents as are required by the commission and this ordinance, to establish the 
streets as private; and 
(g) ?Such additional information as may be required by the commission. 
c. ?Action by commission for secondary approval of development plans. 
1. ?Within a reasonable time following the applicant's satisfaction of all requirements for 
secondary approval, the commission shall either grant, with or without conditions or deny 
secondary approval of the development plan. If secondary approval is denied, the 
commission shall within three days thereafter, furnish the applicant with a written list of the 
reasons for such denial. 
2. ?Notwithstanding the requirements of the ordinance for submission to the commission of 
certain approvals for improvements installed, the commission may, upon written request by 
the applicant, supported by evidence that all submissions have been timely filed, grant 
secondary approval of a development plan although one or more of such approvals may 
not have been delivered to or received by the commission. The commission may grant 
such secondary approval only when the applicant provides a written statement made under 
oath and approved by the commission or the commission staff, for recordation as a 
protective covenant or supplement thereto, stating that the applicant will cause to be 
provided at his cost all things necessary to attain or accomplish the delivery of the required 
approval(s) which shall not then have been delivered to or received by the commission. If 
the applicant does not then deliver such approval(s) in a timely fashion, the commission is 
hereby empowered to refuse to issue either improvement location permits or certificate of 
occupancy permits. Once the applicant has thereafter secured and delivered to the 
commission the required approval(s), the director shall then execute a recordable 
document, which shall then be recorded by the applicant at his expense, rescinding the 
aforesaid recorded written statement. 
3. ?The commission may require the posting of a bond or a letter of credit in an amount 
determined by the commission sufficient to complete all required infrastructure if such is 
not completed by the applicant within the timetable contained in the secondary approval. 
d. ?Issuance of permits. 
1. ?Prior to the issuance of an improvement location permit for any use in a district wherein a 
development plan is required, the following matters shall be accomplished: 
(a) ?The commission shall have granted primary and secondary approval of the 
development plan in accordance with this ordinance and the Warsaw city 
comprehensive plan; and 
(b) ?The applicant shall have duly recorded in the office of the recorder of Kosciusko 
County, Indiana, the utility easements, rights-of-way, plats, deed restrictions, or any 
other legal instruments required, and in the form approved by the commission. 
2. ?The requirement for such approval of a development plan, prior to the issuance of an 
improvement location permit, shall also specifically apply to any residential condominium 
development which is subject to the requirements of IC 32-1-6, the Indiana Horizontal 
Property Act, as the same may be amended from time to time, regardless of whether the 
zoning district in which the subject real estate is located required approval of a 
development plan for the intended use under this ordinance. 
e. ?Amendments to approved development plan. 
1. ?General requirements. After the commission has granted either primary or secondary 
approval of a development plan, any amendments thereto shall be submitted by the 
applicant to the director by way of an amended application for the type of approval sought, 
on a form prescribed by the commission. Any such application shall also be accompanied 
by the pertinent submissions required under this ordinance for the proposed amendments 
involved, together with the requisite filing fee if a public hearing is required hereunder to be 
held upon the amended application. 
2. ?Execution of amended application. Any application submitted for amendment of a 
development plan following the granting by the commission of primary approval, but prior 
to the granting of secondary approval, need contain only the signature(s) of the original 
applicant(s), or the successor(s) in interest thereto. After secondary approval of a 
development plan has been granted, any applications for proposed amendments thereto 
shall contain the signatures of all owners of record, as shown in the tax records maintained 
by the auditor of Kosciusko County, Indiana, at the time such application is filed, of the real 
estate included in that portion of the development plan for which secondary approval had 
previously been granted and for which amendment is being sought. 
3. ?Requirement for public hearing. If, in the opinion of the director, the amendment to the 
development plan proposed in such application is substantial, in terms of the scope of the 
overall project and/or the possible impact upon the community and land uses, both existing 
and planned, which surround the area included in the development plan, the director may 
require the matter to be heard by the commission at a public hearing. 
4. ?Commission action. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, nothing in this section shall 
preclude the commission from requiring, as a condition for the granting of primary approval 
of an overall development plan, that subsequent public hearings be conducted before the 
commission, as to any portions of the overall development plan or any later amendments, 
alterations or modifications proposed with regard thereto. The commission may, however, 
waive any procedural or submission requirements when reviewing a change to an 
approved development plan. 
5. ?Conduct of subsequent public hearing. If the commission requests, or is required under the 
provisions of this ordinance, to conduct a second or subsequent public hearing for approval 
of a development plan or an amendment thereto, then such hearing shall be conducted 
and notice furnished in accordance with the pertinent rules duly adopted by the 
commission. 
f. ?Waiver of development plan submission. 
1. ?Notwithstanding any provisions in this ordinance to the contrary, the director shall have the 
authority to issue an improvement location permit for construction of an improvement in a 
planned district, without the prior submission and approval of a development plan, under 
the following circumstances: 
(a) ?The proposed improvement would not have a significant impact upon adjacent land 
uses, and upon the street system and utility and storm drainage facilities which serve 
the real estate on which the improvement is to be located; and 
(b) ?The public convenience and welfare would not be substantially served by requiring 
submission and approval of a development plan for the proposed improvement. 
2. ?If the director initially determines that an improvement location permit may be issued 
without submission of a development plan, under subparagraph (a) above, the director 
may require that before issuance of such permit, the application for it be circulated among 
potentially interested governmental and quasipublic agencies, for review and comment 
upon the proposed improvement. 
3. ?After circulation of the improvement location permit application as provided under 
subparagraph (b) above, the director may: 
(a) ?Impose conditions which must be satisfied by the applicant for the permit before 
issuance of it; 
(b) ?Determine if the applicant must submit a development plan to the commission in 
accordance with the normal requirements of this ordinance; or 
(c) ?Issue the permit without exception or condition. 
4. ?If the director imposes conditions for issuance of an improvement location permit, and the 
applicant for the permit disagrees with those conditions, the applicant shall submit a 
development plan to the commission for approval in accordance with the normal 
requirements of this ordinance. Such determination by the director shall not be considered 
as appealable to the board of zoning appeals. 
13.6.3. ?Development plan design standards. 
a. ?[Minimum standards.] The following minimum design standards shall apply to all improvements 
upon real estate for which a development plan is required. Individual zoning districts may also 
supplement the following standards, with more detailed standards pertinent to the individual 
districts. 
1. ?Environmental design. 
(a) ?It is the intention of the commission to encourage the preservation of natural site 
amenities and to minimize the disturbance to the natural environment. 
(b) ?Existing trees and other natural features shall be preserved whenever possible. The 
location of these features must be considered when planning common open space, 
location of buildings, underground services, walks, paved areas, and finished grade 
levels. The commission may inquire into the means whereby natural features will be 
protected during construction. 
2. ?Building separation. 
(a) ?In reviewing the location of all structures within the development plan boundaries, the 
commission shall determine that said structures are located to allow adequate light, 
air, ease of entry and access by emergency vehicles. For those districts without 
specified yard requirements, the commission shall be guided by the following: 
(1) ?That the open areas provided around the building be sufficient to provide the 
occupants of the structure with adequate light and air from all outside walls which

13.7.1. ?Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to 
promote the safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Warsaw. It will establish 
reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented 
businesses within the city. The provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of 
imposing a restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented

access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access 
by the distributor and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment of their intended market. Neither 
is it the intent or effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

businesses in the City of Warsaw. 
b. ?The two most common types of secondary effects relate to crime and real estate. 
c. ?In Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), the Supreme Court determined that 
government can prohibit the time, manner and place of sexually oriented businesses as long as 
it serves a legitimate government interest. 
d. ?There is a significant increase in criminal activity (specifically sex crimes) in the immediate 
vicinity of a sexually oriented business. 
e. ?Property values decline in areas surrounding a sexually oriented business. 
f. ?Negative impacts of sexually oriented businesses end between 1,000 and 1,500 feet.

ARTICLE 18. - FLOOD HAZARD AREAS[7] 

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2015-08-04, § 3, adopted September 8, 2015, amended to read in its entirety as 
herein set out. Former Article 18, § 18-1, pertained to Environmental Development Regulations, and 
derived from Ord. No. 2002-07-04. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 


18.1. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose, and objectives. 
(a) ?Statutory authorization . The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 granted the power to local 
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common Council of the 
City of Warsaw does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(b) ?Findings of fact . 
(1) ?The flood hazard areas of the City of Warsaw are subject to periodic inundation which results in 
loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental 
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the 
tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(2) ?These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing 
increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses 
vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately 
flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(c) ?Statement of purpose . It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and 
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by 
provisions designed to: 
(1) ?Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or 
erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities. 
(2) ?Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected 
against flood damage at the time of initial construction. 
(3) ?Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers 
which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
(4) ?Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood 
damage 
(5) ?Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or 
which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(6) ?Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling 
the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(d) ?Objectives. The objectives of this ordinance are: 
(1) ?To protect human life and health. 
(2) ?To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects. 
(3) ?To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally 
undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
(4) ?To minimize prolonged business interruptions. 
(5) ?To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, 
telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains. 
(6) ?To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood 
prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood bright areas.

18.2. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so as 
to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable 
application. 
    A zone means portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, 
snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are 
usually not a significant threat to buildings These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1—A30, 
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented below: 
    Zone A: Areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event. Because 
detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown. 
    Zone AE and A1-A30: Areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood 
event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. (Zone 
AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1—A30.) 
    Zone AO: Areas subject to inundation by one percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually 
sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood 
depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. 
    Zone AH: Areas subject to inundation by one percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually 
areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths 
derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. 
    Zone AR: Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection 
system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection. 
    Zone A99: Areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event, but which 
will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction federal flood protection system. 
These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction 
of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance rating 
purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified 
statutory progress toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure with a floor area 400 square feet or 
less that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is 
incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial 
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage 
potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, 
and hay sheds. 
    Addition (to an existing structure) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a 
structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any 
walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter 
load-bearing walls, is new construction. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision 
of this ordinance. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH Zone on the community's Flood Insurance 
Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not 
exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be 
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given 
year. 
    Base Flood Elevation (BFE) means the elevation of the one percent annual chance flood. 
    Basement means that portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all 
sides. 
    Boundary river means the part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between Kentucky and 
Indiana. 
    Boundary river floodway means the floodway of a boundary river. 
    Building . See "structure." 
    Community means a political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain ordinances 
for the area under its jurisdiction. 
    Community Rating System (CRS) means a program developed by the Federal Insurance 
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular program that have gone beyond 
the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from 
flooding. 
    Critical facility means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical 
facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency 
response installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste. 
    D Zone means unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding is possible. 
Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in this zone. 
    Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including but not 
limited to: 
(1) ?Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any addition to a structure; 
(2) ?Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a manufactured home or 
installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than 180 days; 
(3) ?Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction of roads, or similar projects; 
(4) ?Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes, dams, channel improvements, 
etc.; 
(5) ?Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling operations; 
(6) ?Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts; 
(7) ?Storage of materials; or 
(8) ?Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface waters. 
    "Development" does not include activities such as the maintenance of existing structures and 
facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar 
agricultural practices that do not involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent 
structures. 
    Elevated structure means a non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor elevated above the 
ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, filled stern wall foundations (also called 
chain walls), pilings, or columns (posts and piers). 
    Elevation certificate is a certified statement that verifies a structure's elevation information. 
    Emergency program means the first phase under which a community participates in the NFIP. It is 
intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that 
community before the effective date of the initial FIRM. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for 
which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be 
affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site 
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the community's first 
floodplain ordinance. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional 
sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be 
affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the 
pouring of concrete pads). 
    FEMA means the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
    Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry 
land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from 
any source. 
    Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM) means an official map on which the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood 
hazards and regulatory floodway. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which FEMA has 
delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the 
community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) is the official hydraulic and hydrologic report provided by FEMA. The 
report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM (where applicable), and the water surface 
elevation of the base flood. 
    Flood prone area means any land area acknowledged by a community as being susceptible to 
inundation by water from any source. (See "Flood") 
    Flood protection grade (FPG) is the elevation of the regulatory flood plus two feet at any given 
location in the SFHA. (See "freeboard") 
    Floodplain means the channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or watercourse 
which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory flood. The floodplain includes both the 
floodway and the fringe districts. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive 
measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in 
the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain 
management regulations, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this ordinance and other zoning ordinances, subdivision 
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of 
police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local 
regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss 
and damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain 
ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management requirements. 
    Floodproofing (dry floodproofing) is a method of protecting a structure that ensures that the structure, 
together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation 
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components of these 
walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of 
buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact forces. 
    Floodproofing certificate is a form used to certify compliance for non-residential structures as an 
alternative to elevating structures to or above the FPG. This certification must be by a Registered 
Professional Engineer or Architect. 
    Floodway is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplains adjoining the 
channel which are reasonably required to efficiently carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the 
regulatory flood of any river or stream. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for 
the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate for the many unknown factors that 
could contribute to flood heights greater than those calculated for the base flood. 
    Fringe is those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway. 
    Hardship (as related to variances of this ordinance) means the exceptional hardship that would result 
from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City of Warsaw Board of Zoning Appeals requires that 
the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial 
hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal 
preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional 
hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if 
the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a 
different use than originally intended. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start 
of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structures means any structures individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places 
or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures. 
    Increased cost of compliance (ICC) means the cost to repair a substantially damaged structure that 
exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a substantially damaged structure into 
compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are 
elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new business flood 
insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage. 
    Letter of final determination (LFD) means a letter issued by FEMA during the mapping update 
process which establishes final elevations and provides the new flood map and flood study to the 
community. The LFD initiates the six-month adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its 
floodplain management regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously 
incorporated an automatic adoption clause. 
    Letter of map change (LOMC) is a general term used to refer to the several types of revisions and 
amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter. They include letter of map amendment 
(LOMA), letter of map revision (LOMR), and letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F). The definitions 
are presented below: 
    Letter of map amendment (LOMA) means an amendment by letter to the currently effective 
FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA through the submittal of property 
specific elevation data. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA. 
    Letter of map revision (LOMR) means an official revision to the currently effective FEMA map. It 
is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations, and elevations. 
    Letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) means an official revision by letter to an effective 
NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has 
been elevated on fill above the BFE and excluded from the SFHA. 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the lowest elevation, after completion of construction, of the ground, 
sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest elevation described among the following: 
(1) ?The top of the lowest level of the structure. 
(2) ?The top of the basement floor. 
(3) ?The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of the structure. 
(4) ?The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars. 
(5) ?The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an elevated structure 
where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance to the flow of flood waters unless: 
a. ?The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic flood forces on the walls 
by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by providing a minimum of two openings 
(in addition to doorways and windows) in a minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has 
more than one enclosed area, each shall have openings on exterior walls; 
b. ?The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square inch for every one square 
foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one foot 
above the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening, 
whichever is higher; and, 
c. ?Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of vehicles and building access. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a 
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the 
required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into 
two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Market value means the building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a willing buyer and 
seller), as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by 
independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or 
adjusted assessed values. 
    Mitigation means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and 
property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect people and 
structures, and to minimize the cost of disaster response and recovery. 
    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the federal program that makes flood insurance 
available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of 
the Federal Government and the private insurance industry. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as 
a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced after the 
effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for 
which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be 
affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site 
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the community's 
first floodplain ordinance. 
    Non-boundary river floodway means the floodway of any river or stream other than a boundary river. 
    North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) as adopted in 1993 is a vertical control datum 
used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    Obstruction includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, 
abutment, protection, excavation, canalization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, 
refuse, fill, structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse 
which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water; or due to its 
location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being 
carried downstream. 
    One-percent annual chance flood is the flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or 
exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the one-percent 
annual chance flood. See "Regulatory Flood". 
    Physical map revision (PMR) is an official republication of a community's FEMA map to effect 
changes to base (one-percent annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain boundary delineations, 
regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural 
works or improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base flood 
elevations or SFHAs. 
    Public safety and nuisance means anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire 
community, neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free 
passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis; (2) 400 square feet or 
less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (3) designed to be self-propelled or 
permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, 
but as quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regular program means the phase of the community's participation in the NFIP where more 
comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and higher amounts of insurance are 
available based upon risk zones and elevations determined in a FIS. 
    Regulatory flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any 
given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable to and approved by the Indiana 
Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood 
elevation at any location is as defined in 18.3(b) of this ordinance. The "Regulatory Flood" is also known 
by the term "base flood", "one-percent annual chance flood", and "100-year flood". 
    Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions 
during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, 
equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Section 1316 is that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states 
that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that the Administrator finds has 
been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in 
violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict 
land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means those lands within the jurisdiction of the city subject to 
inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the City of Warsaw are generally identified as such on 
the Kosciusko County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated September 30, 
2015 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as zone A, AE, A1—
A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO). 
    Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was 
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 
days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a 
structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of 
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a 
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and 
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a 
basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the 
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling 
units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction 
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not 
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls and a roof. The 
term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term 
also includes recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of 
restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market 
value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of 
a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the 
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "repetitive 
loss" or "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not include 
improvements of structures to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code 
requirements or any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the 
structures continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Suspension means the removal of a participating community from the NFIP because the community 
has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management regulations required for participation 
in the NFIP. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits construction in a 
manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary 
hardship. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this 
ordinance. A structure or other development without the elevation, other certification, or other evidence of 
compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation 
is provided. 
    Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or 
over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which 
substantial flood damage may occur. 
    X zone means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X zones 
shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with 
a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on 
older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less than 0.2 
percent. 
    Zone means a geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the 
area. 
    Zone A. (See definition for A zone) 
    Zone B, C, and X means areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or minimal hazard 
from the principal source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by 
severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is 
available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on 
new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.) 
(Ord. No. 2015-08-04, § 3, 9-8-2015) 


18.3. - General provisions. 
(a) ?Lands to which this ordinance applies. This ordinance shall apply to all SFHAs and known flood 
prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Warsaw. 
(b) ?Basis for establishing regulatory flood data. This ordinance's protection standard is the regulatory 
flood. The best available regulatory flood data is listed below. 
(1) ?The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the studied SFHAs within the 
jurisdiction of the City of Warsaw shall be as delineated on the one-percent annual chance flood 
profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Kosciusko County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas 
dated September 30, 2015 and the corresponding flood insurance rate map dated September 
30, 2015 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. 
(2) ?The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each of the SFHAs within the 
jurisdiction of the City of Warsaw, delineated as an "A Zone" on the Kosciusko County, Indiana 
and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated September 30, 2015 as well as any 
future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency with the most recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by 
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the 
subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available 
data, the party needs to replace existing data with better data that meets current engineering 
standards. To be considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural 
Resources for review and subsequently approved. 
(3) ?In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification on a FEMA map, the 
regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's 
known flood prone areas shall be according to the best data available as provided by the 
Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the 
subject site is greater than one square mile. 
(4) ?Upon issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD), any more restrictive data in the new (not 
yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized for permitting and construction (development) 
purposes, replacing all previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA. 
(c) ?Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain development permit shall be required 
in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance prior to the commencement of any development 
activities in areas of special flood hazard. 
(d) ?Compliance. No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered 
within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable 
regulations. No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with 
the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations. 
(e) ?Abrogation and greater restrictions. This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any 
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another 
conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(f) ?Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations. 
(1) ?In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM 
and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the profiles shall govern. 
(2) ?If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood elevation, that site shall be 
included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly. 
(3) ?If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the base flood elevation and not 
located within the floodway, that site shall be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain 
regulations will not be applied. The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA. 
(g) ?Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this ordinance all provisions shall be: 
(1) ?Considered as minimum requirements. 
(2) ?Liberally construed in favor of the governing body. 
(3) ?Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(h) ?Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is 
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from 
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. 
Therefore, this ordinance does not create any liability on the part of the City of Warsaw, the Indiana 
Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from 
reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. 
(i) ?Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit in the SFHA or failure to 
comply with the requirements of a floodplain development permit or conditions of a variance shall be 
deemed to be a violation of this ordinance. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance 
and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the zoning code for the City of Warsaw. 
All violations shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000.00. 
(1) ?A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation continues to exist. 
(2) ?The City of Warsaw Common Council shall inform the owner that any such violation is 
considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a 
standard flood insurance policy to be suspended. 
(3) ?Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy 
any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. 
(Ord. No. 2015-08-04, § 3, 9-8-2015) 


18.4. - Administration. 
(a) ?Designation of administrator. The common council of the City of Warsaw hereby appoints the city 
planner to administer and implement the provisions of this ordinance and is herein referred to as the 
floodplain administrator.

proposed development. A hydrologic and hydraulic engineering study is required and any 
watercourse changes submitted to DNR for approval and then to FEMA as a Letter of Map 
Revision. (See section 18.4(c)(6) for additional information.) 
(2) ?Construction stage. Upon establishment of the lowest floor of an elevated structure or structure 
constructed on fill, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit to the floodplain administrator a 
certification of the NAVD 88 or NGVD elevation of the lowest floor, as built. Said certification 
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or 
professional engineer and certified by the same. The floodplain administrator shall review the 
lowest floor elevation survey data submitted. The applicant shall correct deficiencies detected 
by such review before any further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or 
failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for 
the project. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the elevation certification shall be at the 
applicant's risk. 
Upon establishment of the floodproofed elevation of a flood proofed structure, it shall be the 
duty of the applicant to submit to the floodplain administrator a floodproofing certificate. 
Certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered professional 
engineer and certified by same. (The floodplain administrator shall review the floodproofing 
certification submitted.) The applicant shall correct any deficiencies detected by such review 
before any further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the floodproofing certification or 
failure to make correction required shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project. 
(3) ?Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, an elevation certification (FEMA 
Elevation Certificate Form 81-31 or any future updates) which depicts the "as-built" lowest floor 
elevation is required to be submitted to the floodplain administrator. If the project includes a 
floodproofing measure, floodproofing certification (FEMA Floodproofing Certificate Form 81-65 
or any future updates) is required to be submitted by the applicant to the floodplain 
administrator. 
(c) ?Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. The floodplain administrator and/or 
designated staff is hereby authorized and directed to enforce the provisions of this ordinance. The 
administrator is further authorized to render interpretations of this ordinance, which are consistent

elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters 
shall be provided in accordance with the standards of section 18.5(b)(4). Structures located in 
all "A Zones" may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated if done in accordance with the 
following: 
a. ?A Registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the structure has been 
designed so that below the FPG, the structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight 
and capable of resisting the effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall take 
into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures, and impacts from 
debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth 
in section 18.4(c)(12). 
b. ?Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention and without an 
outside source of electricity. 
(4) ?Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated structures shall 
have the lowest floor at or above the FPG. 
Elevated structures with fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls 
below the flood protection grade shall be designed to preclude finished living space and 
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood 
forces on exterior walls. Designs must meet the following minimum criteria: 
a. ?Provide a minimum of two openings located in a minimum of two exterior walls (having a 
total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area). 
b. ?The bottom of all openings shall be no more than one foot above the exterior grade or the 
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher. 
c. ?Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices 
provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.

properties. 
e. ?The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or above the FPG. 
f. ?Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material. 
(6) ?Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Manufactured homes and 
recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially improved on a site for more than 180 days 
must meet one of the following requirements: 
a. ?These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site outside a 
manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing 
manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred 
"substantial damage" as a result of a flood: 
(i) ?The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the 
lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely anchored to an adequately 
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(ii) ?Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the FPG 
shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry 
and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior 
walls as required for elevated structures in section 18.5(b)(4). 
(iii) ?Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame or foundation of a 
manufactured home are not required to have openings. 
b. ?These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site in an existing 
manufactured home park or subdivision that has not been substantially damaged by a 
flood: 
(i) ?The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured 
home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elevations that are 
no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an 
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral 
movement. 
(ii) ?Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the FPG 
shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry 
and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior 
walls as required for elevated structures in section 18.5(b)(4). 
(iii) ?Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame or foundation of a 
manufactured home are not required to have openings. 
c. ?Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either: 
(i) ?Be on site for less than 180 days; 
(ii) ?Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being on its wheels or jacking 
system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security 
devices, and has no permanently attached additions); or 
(iii) ?Meet the requirements for "manufactured homes" as stated earlier in this section. 
(7) ?Accessory structures. Relief to the elevation or dry floodproofing standards may be granted for 
accessory structures. Such structures must meet the following standards: 
a. ?Shall not be used for human habitation. 
b. ?Shall be constructed of flood resistant materials. 
c. ?Shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of 
floodwaters. 
d. ?Shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation. 
e. ?Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed 
to or above the FPG. 
f. ?Shall be designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize 
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated structures in section 
18.5(b)(4). 
(8) ?Above ground gas or liquid storage tanks. All above ground gas or liquid storage tanks shall be 
anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement. 
(c) ?Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1) ?All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
(2) ?All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, 
and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(3) ?All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood 
hazards. 
(4) ?Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed 
development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions), which is greater than the 
lesser of 50 lots or five acres. 
(5) ?All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into/out of SFHA for pedestrians and 
vehicles (especially emergency responders). 
(d) ?Critical facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside 
the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if 
no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the 
lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be 
taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access 
routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. 
(e) ?Standards for identified floodways. Located within SFHAs, established in section 18.3(b), are areas 
designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of 
floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an 
identified floodway, the floodplain administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, 
along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and 
apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for 
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the 
issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity 
located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and 
paving, etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does 
exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary 
river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a 
residence in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the 
floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to 
elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is required from the Indiana 
Department of Natural Resources.) 
    No action shall be taken by the floodplain administrator until a permit or letter of authorization (when 
applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for 
construction in the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of authorization has 
been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the floodplain administrator may issue the 
local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in section 18.5 of this ordinance 
have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for 
construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a 
community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence. 
    No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination with existing or future 
development, that will adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. 
This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least 0.15 of a 
foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that under 
the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses. 
    For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the city shall submit the data 
and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per 
mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12. 
(f) ?Standards for identified fringe. If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the floodplain 
administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the provisions contained in 
section 18.5 of this ordinance have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of 
any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG. 
(g) ?Standards for SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/fringes. 
(1) ?Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile: 
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet 
been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, 
the floodplain administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all 
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review 
and comment. 
No action shall be taken by the floodplain administrator until either a permit for construction in a 
floodway (including letters of authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing 
the one percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade 
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. 
Once the floodplain administrator has received the proper permit for construction in a floodway 
(including letters of authorization) or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the 
proposed development, a floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions 
of the floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from 
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in section 18.5 of 
this ordinance have been met. 
(2) ?Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile: 
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet 
been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the 
floodplain administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing 
the limits of the floodplain and one percent annual chance flood elevation for the site. 
Upon receipt, the floodplain administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit, 
provided the provisions contained in section 18.4 of this ordinance have been met. 
(3) ?The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing 
and anticipated development, shall not increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot 
and shall not increase flood damages or potential flood damages. 
(h) ?Standards for flood prone areas. All development in known flood prone areas not identified on 
FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as 
required per section 18.5. 
(Ord. No. 2015-08-04, § 3, 9-8-2015) 


18.6. - Variance procedures. 
(a) ?Designation of Variance and Appeals Board. The City of Warsaw Board of Zoning Appeals shall 
hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from requirements of this ordinance. 
(b) ?Duties of Variance and Appeals Board. The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged 
an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the floodplain administrator in the 
enforcement or administration of this ordinance. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board 
may appeal such decision to the Kosciusko County Superior or Circuit Court. 
(c) ?Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the board shall consider all technical 
evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance; and 
(1) ?The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 
(2) ?The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of 
such damage on the individual owner. 
(3) ?The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
(4) ?The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where applicable. 
(5) ?The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or 
erosion damage. 
(6) ?The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development. 
(7) ?The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management 
program for that area. 
(8) ?The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
(9) ?The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment of transport of the 
floodwaters at the site. 
(10) ?The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including 
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water 
systems, and streets and bridges. 
(d) ?Conditions for variances. 
(1) ?Variances shall only be issued when there is: 
a. ?A showing of good and sufficient cause. 
b. ?A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship. 
c. ?A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, 
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause 
fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances. 
(2) ?No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to section 18.5(e) or (g)(2) of this 
ordinance may be granted. 
(3) ?Any variance granted in a floodway subject to section 18.5(e) or (g)(1) of this ordinance will 
require a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. 
(4) ?Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of section 18.5(b), may be granted only 
when a new structure is to be located on a lot of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and 
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade. 
(5) ?Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum 
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(6) ?Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of any structure individually 
listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites 
and Structures. 
(7) ?Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the 
difference between the flood protection grade and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be 
built and stating that the cost of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased 
risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation (See section 18.6(e)). 
(8) ?The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of appeal actions and report any 
variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Indiana Department of Natural 
Resources upon request (See section 18.6(e)). 
(e) ?Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted that allows the lowest floor of a 
structure to be built below the flood protection grade shall be given written notice over the signature 
of a community official that: 
(1) ?The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the flood protection grade will result 
in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of 
insurance coverage; and; 
(2) ?Such construction below the flood protection grade increases risks to life and property. The 
floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for 
their issuance. 
(f) ?Historic structure. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" 
upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's 
continued designation as an "historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the 
historic character and design of the structure. 
(g) ?Special conditions. Upon the consideration of the factors listed in section 18.6, and the purposes of 
this ordinance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances 
as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.
