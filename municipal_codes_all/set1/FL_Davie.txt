PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the Town of Davie, Florida of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1964 Code, as supplemented through December 15, 1982, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1964 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinances included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the sixteenth section of Chapter 3 is 3-16. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 8-4 and 8-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 8-4.1, 8-4.2 and 8-4.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 7 and 8, it will be designated as Chapter 7.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of A. Lawton Langford, President, Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

    The publishers are most grateful to Patricia McDaniel, Administrative Services Director and Barry S. Webber, Town Attorney for their cooperation and assistance and for the interest shown by them in the preparation of the manuscript of this publication.

Editor's note- The Charter as set out in Part I hereof is derived from Ch. 61-2056, Laws of Florida, Sp. Acts 1961 as shown in the citations following each section. Only minor, nonsubstantive modifications have been made for the purposes of clarity, consistency and uniformity of style. Bracketed material has been added by the editor for the convenience of the user. Amendatory legislation shall be cited in chronological order following citations to Ch. 61-2056. 
Ordinance No. 97-7, adopted January 15, 1997, and approved by a majority of the electors voting in a referendum held March 11, 1997, extensively amended the Charter by deleting and renumbering sections. For specific disposition, see the Charter Comparative Table.

(b)  A person convicted of a violation of this Code or a person who has entered a plea of guilty or a plea of nolo contendere to a violation of that Code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00), or imprisonment for a term not exceeding sixty (60) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the judge of the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction. The trial court, in its discretion, may also place a defendant on probation, alone or in conjunction with the above penalties. With respect to violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues is a separate offense. 
(c)  In addition to the penalties hereinabove provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this Code shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be, by the town, abated as provided by law, and each day that such condition continues shall be regarded as a new and separate offense. 
(d)  Probation. "Probation" means a form of town supervision requiring specified contacts with the Town of Davie Work Program Administrator, and other terms and conditions as hereinafter provided. 
(1)  Terms and conditions of probation. The court shall determine the terms and conditions of probation and may include among them the following, that the probationer shall: 
a.  Report to the town's work program administrator, as directed, to perform community service work. In lieu of such participation, the court may order that a defendant pay an additional fine of ten dollars ($10.00) for each hour of community service work otherwise required. 
b.  Work faithfully at suitable employment insofar as may be possible. 
c.  Make reparation or restitution to the aggrieved party for the damage or loss caused by his offense in an amount to be determined by the court. The court shall make such reparation or restitution a condition of probation, unless it determines that clear and compelling reasons exist to the contrary. If the court does not order restitution, or orders restitution of only a portion of the damages, it shall state on the record in detail the reasons therefor. 
(2)  Condition of probation-restitution. If a defendant is placed on probation, any restitution ordered shall be a condition of such probation. The court may revoke probation if the defendant fails to comply with such order. In determining whether to revoke probation, the court shall consider the defendant's employment status, earning ability, and financial resources; the willfulness of the defendant's failure to pay; and any other special circumstances that may have a bearing on the defendant's ability to pay. 
(3)  Violation of probation; revocation; modification; continuance. 
a.  Whenever within the period of probation there are reasonable grounds to believe that a probationer has violated his probation in a material respect, the town's work program administrator may request a town law enforcement officer to arrest such probationer without warrant wherever found and forthwith return him to the court granting such probation. Any committing magistrate may issue a warrant, upon the facts being made known to him by affidavit of one having knowledge of such facts, for the arrest of the probationer, returnable forthwith before the court granting such probation. Any parole or probation supervisor, any officer authorized to serve criminal process, or any peace officer of this state is authorized to serve and execute such warrant. The court, upon the probationer being brought before it, shall advise him of such charge of violation and, if such charge is admitted to be true, may forthwith revoke, modify or continue the probation. If probation is revoked, the court shall adjudge the probationer guilty of the offense charged and proven or admitted, unless he has previously been adjudged guilty, and impose any sentence which it might have originally imposed before placing the probationer on probation. If such violation of probation is not admitted by the probationer, the court may commit him or release him with or without bail to await further hearing, or it may dismiss the charge of probation. If such charge is not at that time admitted by the probationer and if it is not dismissed, the court, as soon as may be practicable, shall give the probationer an opportunity to be fully heard on his behalf in person or by counsel. After such hearing, the court may revoke, modify or continue the probation. If such probation is revoked, the court shall adjudge the probationer or offender guilty of the offense charged and proven or admitted, unless he has previously been adjudged guilty, and impose any sentence which it might have originally imposed before placing the probationer on probation. 
b.  No part of the time that the defendant is on probation shall be considered as any part of the time that he shall be sentenced to serve. 
c.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a probationer who is arrested for violating his probation in a material respect may be taken before the court in the county in which he was arrested. That court shall advise him of such charge of a violation and, if such charge is admitted, shall cause him to be brought before the court which granted the probation. If such probation is not admitted by the probationer, the court may commit him or release him with or without bail to await further hearing. The court, as soon as is practicable, shall give the probationer an opportunity to be fully heard on his behalf in person or by counsel. After such hearing, the court shall make findings of fact and forward the findings to the court which granted the probation and to the probationer or his attorney. The findings of fact by the hearing court are binding on the court which granted the probation. Upon the probationer being brought before it, the court which granted the probation may revoke, modify or continue the probation. 
(4)  Failure to pay restitution. In any hearing in which the failure of a probationer to pay restitution is established by the town, if the probationer asserts his inability to pay restitution, it is incumbent upon him to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he does not have the present resources available to pay restitution despite sufficient bona fide efforts legally to acquire the resources to do so. If the probationer cannot pay restitution despite sufficient bona fide efforts, the court shall consider alternate measures of punishment other than imprisonment. Only if alternate measures are not adequate to meet the town's interests in punishment and deference may the court imprison a probationer who has demonstrated sufficient bona fide efforts to pay restitution.

Sec. 2-56. - Intent and purpose. 
    The town council of the Town of Davie determines and declares that, to maintain the integrity of the government decision making process, the Town of Davie Councilmembers, staff and residents have a legitimate need to know certain information about the activities of "lobbyists", as defined in this article.

As such, this article seeks to impose the least burden which is reasonably necessary on lobbyists, in order to satisfy this public need for information.

    Proposal. A proposal shall be any competitive solicitation by request for proposal (RFP) officially posted by the Town of Davie purchasing staff on the town's website where the award is determined by qualifications. 
Process 
(1)  Competitive bid. For bid evaluation purposes, vendors that meet the definition of "local Davie vendor" as detailed above shall be given a five (5) percent evaluation credit. This shall mean that if a "local Davie vendor" submits a bid/quote that is within five (5) percent of the lowest price submitted by any vendor, the "local Davie vendor" shall have an option to submit another bid which is at least one (1) percent lower than the lowest responsive bid/quote. If the "local Davie vendor" submits a bid which is at least one (1) percent lower than that lowest responsive bid/quote, then the award will go to the "local Davie vendor." If not, the award will be made to the vendor that submits the lowest responsive bid/quote. If the lowest responsive and responsible bidder is a "local Davie vendor," the award will be made to that vendor and no other bidders will be given an opportunity to submit additional bids as described herein. 
For bid evaluation purposes, vendors that meet the definition of "local Broward County vendor" as detailed above shall be given a two and one-half (2.5) percent evaluation credit. This shall mean that if a "local Broward County vendor" submits a bid/quote that is within two and one-half (2.5) percent of the lowest price submitted by any vendor, the "local Broward County vendor" shall have an option to submit another bid which is at least one (1) percent lower than the lowest responsive bid/quote. If the "local Broward County vendor" submits a bid which is at least one (1) percent lower than that lowest responsive bid/quote, then the award will go to the "local Broward County vendor." If not, the award will be made to the vendor that submits the lowest responsive bid/quote. If the lowest responsive and responsible bidder is a "local Davie vendor", the award will be made to that vendor and no other bidders will be given an opportunity to submit additional bids as described herein. 
If there is a "local Davie vendor" and a "local Broward County vendor" participating in the same bid solicitation and both vendors qualify to submit a second bid as detailed above, the "local Davie vendor" will be given first option. If the "local Davie vendor" cannot beat the lowest bid received by at least one (1) percent, an opportunity will be given to the "local Broward County vendor." If the "local Broward County vendor" cannot beat the lowest bid by at least one (1) percent, then the bid will be awarded to the lowest bidder regardless of geographic location of the business. 
If multiple "local Davie vendors" submit bids/quotes which are within five (5) percent of the lowest bid/quote, then all vendors will be asked to submit a "best and final offer (BAFO)." The award will be made to the "local Davie vendor" submitting the lowest BAFO providing that that BAFO is at least one (1) percent lower than the lowest bid/quote received in the original solicitation. If no "local Davie vendor" can beat the lowest bid/quote by at least one (1) percent, then the process will be repeated with all "local Broward County vendors" who have submitted a bid/quote which is within two and one-half (2.5) percent of the lowest bid/quote. If no "local Davie vendor" and no "local Broward County vendor" can submit a BAFO that is at least one (1) percent lower than the lowest bid/quote submitted in the original solicitation, the award will be made to the lowest responsive bidder regardless of geographic location of the business. 
(b)  Competitive proposal. For evaluation purposes, "local Davie vendor" and "local Broward County vendor" shall be a criterion for award in any request for proposal unless specifically exempted by the town administrator or the town council. 
(c)  Exceptions. 
1.  No "local vendor" preference will be included in any competitive solicitation where the town is the lead agency for the Southeast Florida Cooperative Purchasing Group. 
2.  Utilization of a state or other agency contract. 
3.  State or Federal law prohibits the use of local preference. 
4.  The work is funded in whole or in part by a governmental entity where the laws, rules, regulations or policies prohibit the use of local preferences. 
5.  Sole source or single source purchases. 
6.  The "local vendor" is either non-responsive or non-responsible. 
7.  All bids submitted exceed the budget amount for the project. 
8.  Emergency purchases. 
9.  The town administrator and/or the town council may exempt any competitive solicitation from the local vendor preference.

Sec. 6-7. - Code inspectors' duties. 
(a)  The code inspectors shall have the primary duty to enforce the various codes and ordinances and initiate an enforcement proceeding before the special magistrate. The special magistrate shall not have the power to initiate such enforcement proceedings. 
(b)  If a violation of a code or ordinance is found, the code inspectors shall give written notification to the alleged violator of the violation in accordance with [Florida Statutes] Chapter 162. The written notification may consist of a "notice of violation and hearing" or a citation. The notice of violation and hearing shall give the alleged violator a reasonable time, in light of the nature of the violation, to correct the violation. The notice of violation and hearing shall advise the alleged violator that should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, or if the violation is corrected and reoccurs or is a repeat violation, that a hearing before a special magistrate regarding such violation shall be held at a time and place set forth in such notice. In the case of a citation being issued to the violator, the citation shall adhere to the procedures defined in [Florida Statutes] Chapter 162, and as proscribed hereafter in this Code. 
(Ord. No. 94-9, § 2, 2-16-94; Ord. No. 2009-7, § 2, 2-4-09) 
Sec. 6-8. - Hearings. 
(a)  The violator shall be given at least ten (10) calendar days' written notification of the hearing. In addition to the written notification of hearing, the town may post a notice of violation and hearing or a citation at the violator's address which shall provide ten (10) calendar days' notification for the hearing. The conduct and preparation of the notice of violation and hearing, or the citation and its issuance to an alleged violator shall be consistent with [Florida Statutes] Chapter 162 as currently enacted or as may be amended from time to time. 
(b)  Hearsay evidence may be accepted for the purpose of supplementing or explaining any direct evidence, but hearsay evidence shall not, in and of itself, be considered sufficient to support a finding or decision unless the evidence would be admissible over objections in a civil action. 
(c)  The alleged violator shall have the right to be represented by an attorney; however, the alleged violator or his attorney shall provide the town with written notice that an attorney is representing the violator's interest at least five (5) calendar days prior to the scheduled date of the hearing. 
(d)  All testimony before the special magistrate shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The alleged violator or the town may cause the proceedings to be recorded by a certified court reporter or other certified recording instrument; however, the town shall be under no obligation to provide a certified court reporter or other certified recording instrument, but, rather, the town may use a recording device of its choice to satisfy its obligation to record the meeting. 
(e)  The burden of proof shall be with the code inspector to show, by the greater weight of evidence, that a code violation exists and that the alleged violator committed or was responsible for maintaining the violation. 
(f)  If notice has been provided to an alleged violator of the hearing, a hearing may be conducted and an order rendered in the absence of the violator. 
(g)  The special magistrate may, for good cause shown, postpone or continue a hearing.

The code enforcement procedures hereby adopted shall include authority for code inspectors to issue citations to violators with accompanying civil penalties as provided herein, to issue notices to appear at a hearing conducted by a county court, and to issue citations for administrative hearings to be heard by town code enforcement special magistrates. 
(b)  The town council does hereby adopt the form and content of a citation as provided by state law currently enacted or as may be amended from time to time. 
(c)  Citations. 
(1)  Code inspectors shall have the authority to initiate enforcement proceedings by issuing a citation to a person that may require the appearance of the violator at an administrative hearing before a special magistrate. 
(2)  Prior to issuing a citation, the code inspector shall provide a written notice to the person or the property owner in violation that there is a violation of a town code or ordinance, and shall establish a reasonable time period, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days, within which the person must correct the violation. If, upon personal investigation, the code inspector finds that the person has not corrected the violation within the designated time period, the code inspector may issue a citation to the person who has committed the violation or the property owner where the violation has occurred. 
(3)  Service of notice of a citation shall be deemed appropriate by hand delivering the citation to the violator or property owner; or posting the citation at the location of the mailing address identified in the public records of the county property appraiser for the violator or property owner in a conspicuous manner. 
(4)  The code inspector is not required to provide the alleged violator or property owner with a reasonable period of time to correct the violation prior to issuing the citation if a repeat violation is found, or if the code inspector has reason to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety or welfare, or that the violator or the property owner is engaged in violations of an itinerant or transient nature, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible. 
(5)  The citation form shall include, but not be limited, to the following: 
a.  Date and time of issuance; 
b.  Name of the code inspector and jurisdiction; 
c.  Name and address of the violator; 
d.  Code section or ordinance that has been violated; 
e.  Brief description of the nature of the violation, including location, date and time of violation; 
f.  Amount of the applicable civil penalty; 
g.  Procedure for the person to follow in order to pay the civil penalty or to contest the citation; 
h.  Notice that if the person fails to pay the civil penalty within the time allowed, and fails to request an administrative hearing before the special magistrate within ten (10) calendar days of service of the citation, the person shall be determined to have waived their rights to contest the citation and that, in such a case, judgment may be entered for the applicable maximum civil penalty; and 
i.  Notice that the person may be liable for reasonable costs of the hearing should the violator be found guilty of the violation. 
(d)  Citation issued to appear before a special magistrate. 
(1)  The person who has been served with a citation to appear before a special magistrate shall either correct the violation, and pay the civil penalty in the manner indicated on the citation; or 
(2)  Request an administrative hearing before a special magistrate to appeal the decision of the code inspector. Said appeal shall be filed not later than ten (10) calendar days after the service of the citation. 
(3)  Failure of the violator to appeal the decision of the code inspector within the ten (10) calendar days shall constitute a waiver of the violator's right to an administrative hearing. A waiver of the right to an administrative hearing may result in the imposition of a fine against the violator and/or costs which may result in a lien on the property where the violation occurred. 
(4)  Should the violator appeal the citation and be found in violation by the special magistrate, in addition to the imposition of a fine, the violator shall be assessed an administrative cost of fifty dollars ($50.00). The special magistrate shall not waive the administrative costs. 
(5)  Should the violator waive their right to an administrative hearing, in addition to the imposition of the fine, the violator shall be assessed an administrative cost of fifty dollars ($50.00) that shall not be waived by the special magistrate.

Sec. 6-9. - Establishment of fine, lien, and cost recovery procedures; establishment of cost recovery schedule of fines. 
(a)  The establishment of a fine and lien shall be consistent with and pursuant to the provisions of Florida Statutes Chapter 162. The special magistrate shall have the authority expressed in Florida Statutes Chapter 162, and adopted by town ordinance to impose fines for code violations which shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day per violation for a first violation, five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per day per violation for a repeat violation, and up to fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) per violation if the special magistrate finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature. When imposing the code enforcement fines the special magistrate shall consider the following criteria in determining the amount of the fines, including, but not limited to, those factors as set forth here: 
(1)  The gravity of the violation; 
(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation. 
(3)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
The town has adopted the provision within Florida Statutes Chapter 162 which allows the imposition of additional fines to cover all costs incurred by the town in enforcing the code and all costs of repairs for said code violations. The town may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the town to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the town for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. The special magistrate may impose additional fines to cover all costs incurred by the town in enforcing its codes and all costs of repairs pursuant to this section. The additional fines shall be determined by the town's actual costs, and may include the costs of the code enforcement administrative and attorney fees. 
(b)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine shall be recorded among the public records of the county and shall constitute a lien against the land upon which the violation exists or, if the violator does not own the land, upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. The lien shall be enforced pursuant to Florida Statutes Chapter 162. As authorized by law, the Town Council may request that the Town Attorney foreclose on duly recorded liens that have remained unpaid. Property subject to a lien established by the special magistrate may be foreclosed by the town in a manner provided by state law.

Complete compliance with the code is required before the town will consider a mitigation request. 
(b)  Upon receipt of a written request for mitigation of a code enforcement lien(s), the code enforcement inspector shall verify that the applicant's property is in compliance with the town codes. In the event the inspector determines that the applicant has not complied with all applicable codes, the mitigation request shall not be submitted to the town council. If the inspector determines that the applicant has complied with all applicable code sections, the inspector shall make a specific monetary recommendation with regard to the amount to which the lien(s) should be mitigated. This recommended amount will consider all costs incurred by the town in prosecuting the subject code enforcement case. 
(c)  The applicant or its representatives must complete section 2 of the mitigation application review form upon notification that the property has been deemed to be in compliance. 
(d)  After the applicant has completed section 2 of the mitigation application review form, including, but not limited to, filling in the specific amount which the applicant requests that the code enforcement lien(s) be mitigated to, the mitigation application review form shall be directed to the head of the department in charge of code enforcement for completion of section 3 of the form. The head of the department in charge of code enforcement shall complete section 3 of the form, which section shall contain the department head's recommendation to either approve or deny the specific request made by the applicant with regard to the amount to which the applicant has requested that the code enforcement lien(s) be mitigated. 
(e)  After completion of section 3 of the form by the department head in charge of code enforcement, the following shall occur: 
(1)  If the applicant agrees with the recommendation of the department head as set forth in section 3 of the form, then an appropriate resolution shall be prepared for the town council's consideration to accept the recommendation of the department head; or 
(2)  If the applicant does not agree with the recommendation, the mitigation request shall be referred to a special master [magistrate], who shall consider the request and make a recommendation to the town council. The mitigation request with the special master's [magistrate's] recommendation shall be considered by the town council, who shall either reject the mitigation request or mitigate the lien to an amount determined by the town council in its sole discretion. 
(f)  In the event a mitigation request is approved by the town council, the resolution shall contain appropriate language requiring the applicant to pay the mitigated amount within forty-five (45) days of council approval. It shall further provide that in the event payment is not timely made, the lien will be enforced in the original amount. Upon approval of the applicant's request by the town council and timely payment of a mitigated code enforcement lien, the town clerk shall record a satisfaction or release of the code enforcement lien(s).

(f)  When the special magistrate issues an order declaring that a structure or premises is unfit for human occupancy or use, the town shall send notice, pursuant to subsection 6-31(k), that orders the structure or premises, or portion thereof, to be vacated within seven (7) days of the date of the special magistrate's order and not reoccupied until a certificate of compliance is issued by the town. Such notice shall describe the conditions for which the structure or premises has been declared unfit for human occupancy or use. The town shall record the special magistrate's order declaring that a structure or premises is unfit for human occupancy or use in the public records of Broward County.

(Ord. No. 2010-9, § 2(6-15.27), 4-7-10) 
Sec. 6-50. - Authorized inspections. 
(a)  The enforcing officers shall be authorized to make inspections to determine the condition of all residential buildings, dwellings, structures and premises within the corporate limits of the Town of Davie in order to safeguard the health, safety, morals and welfare of the public. 
(b)  The enforcing officers shall be authorized to enter any residential buildings, dwellings, structures or premises at any reasonable time or in an emergency, for the purpose of performing the duties of such office under this article, in accordance with the procedures herein prescribed. Except in emergencies which endanger the public health, safety and welfare and at which time no prior consent shall be required, the enforcing officers shall enter residential and non-residential buildings, dwellings, structures or premises only upon the prior consent of the person lawfully in occupancy thereof or the person having legal right of possession thereof, or in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(Ord. No. 2010-9, § 2(6-15.28), 4-7-10) 
Sec. 6-51. - Obtaining an inspection search warrant. 
    The town shall seek an inspection search warrant as follows: 
(a)  When an enforcing officer believes, based upon reliable evidence, that it is more likely than not that a specific building, structure or premises is in violation of the Code of Ordinances including but not limited to a building, fire, safety, environmental, animal control, land use, plumbing, electrical, health, minimum housing, or zoning standard, then the enforcing officer shall: 
(1)  Swear out an affidavit stating with particularity the basis of the officer's belief, including:

(c)  On behalf of the town, the town attorney or code prosecutor shall seek a search warrant from any judge based upon the officer's affidavit and as required by law. 
(Ord. No. 2010-9, § 2(6-15.29), 4-7-10) 
Sec. 6-52. - Execution of the inspection search warrant. 
    Once the enforcing officer has received the administrative search warrant, s/he shall execute the search warrant as soon as possible, provided that the time of execution is reasonable.

(Ord. No. 2010-9, § 2(6-15.30), 4-7-10) 
Sec. 6-53. - Boarding of structures, buildings or dwellings, vacant or non-vacant; boarding permit required. 
    The town recognizes that from time to time it may be necessary to secure real property because of abandonment, disrepair, public hazard or natural disaster. Unsecured property can lead to vandalism problems, occupancy safety problems and appearance problems. The town feels it necessary to create certain criteria for securing structures. Owners of a building to be boarded or that is currently boarded must apply for a six-month boarding permit. The code requires that an owner is expected to renovate the property or sell it to someone who will renovate it. A single six-month extension may be granted by the safety enforcement team (SET team) if the owner has been unable to renovate or sell the property to someone who will renovate it. However, if at the end of one (1) year no improvements have been made or are planned, the Town of Davie Minimum Housing and Property Maintenance Standards Code requires the structure to be demolished and the property cleaned of any remaining debris. 
(a)  Real property may be secured via boarding up windows, doors, or other openings upon the issuance of a boarding approval by the SET team consisting of the town's building official, fire official, and code compliance official prior to any building permit being issued by the town's building official for boarding. 
(b)  Any means of securing property including crime prevention devices shall be subject to review by the town's building official or fire official for safety and compliance with the latest edition of the Florida Building Code and Fire Prevention Code prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(c)  If buildings, structures or premises found in or upon any real property in any zoning district of the town is secured for more than thirty (30) days, except in the case of a natural disaster, the boards, panels or other means of securing structural openings shall be painted to match the exterior color of the building. 
(d)  If any property shall be deemed an abandoned property under Code section 6-9.2, then provisions for SET team boarding approval shall not be applicable in the initial registration stage not to exceed a year, but shall apply at all times thereafter as when a registration renewal or building permit for renovation may be applied for. 
(Ord. No. 2010-9, § 2(6-15.31), 4-7-10) 
Sec. 6-54. - Nuisance to be declared. 
(a)  Any vacant and unoccupied building that has doors, windows, or other openings that are broken or missing, thereby allowing access to the interior, or boarded buildings that are not secured in compliance with methods approved by the building official or boarding that has been undertaken without a boarding approval from SET shall hereby be declared a nuisance, and shall be brought before the unsafe structures board and/or special magistrate and be required to demolish the building or correct violations of the applicable codes and be subject to fines, liens and cost recovery fines. 
(b)  Any vacant and unoccupied building of which doors, windows, or other openings are secured by boarding, but for which there is no active building permit as required by the Florida Building Code or SET boarding approval shall hereby be declared a nuisance and be brought before the unsafe structures board and/or special magistrate and be required to demolish the building or correct violations of the applicable codes and be subject to fines, liens and cost recovery fines. 
(Ord. No. 2010-9, § 2(6-15.32), 4-7-10) 
Sec. 6-55. - Renovating a property. 
(a)  The owner of a property that has been declared to be a nuisance has the option of renovating the property to comply with all requirements of the original site plan, including the landscaping plans. Under no circumstances shall renovating a property be intended to mean simply removing boards, provided the building has been boarded. The intent of renovating is to make the property like new again, thereby decreasing negative impacts to the property values of nearby properties. 
(b)  If the property owner intends to modify the building or structures on the property, including landscaping, and the modifications exceed the thresholds specified in section 12-374 of the Town Code, the owner must submit a new site plan to include landscaping plans in conformance with the site plan modification requirements of the town's planning and zoning division as provided in the Town of Davie Land Development Code Article XII, Subdivisions and Site Plans, Division 3, Site Plan Requirements and Procedures. 
(Ord. No. 2010-9, § 2(6-15.33), 4-7-10) 
Sec. 6-56. - Western Theme District and CRA property. 
(a)  Western Theme District. 
(1)  If the property to be renovated is located within the Western Theme District, all renovations to any structure on the property, including lighting and landscaping must meet the architectural and landscaping standards described in Sections IV and V, respectively, of the Western Theme Overlay District Development Manual. 
(b)  All renovations in the Western Theme District in addition to meeting all site plan approvals, building code and permit issues shall also be approved by the redevelopment administrator of the community redevelopment agency. 
(Ord. No. 2010-9, § 2(6-15.34), 4-7-10) 
Sec. 6-57. - Building permit required for boarding a building. 
(a)  Any unoccupied or occupied dwelling, building, structure or premise which is boarded without a town-issued building permit for boarding the building in a manner approved by the building official shall constitute a nuisance and deemed to be in violation of the Town Code. 
(b)  Any building that is found to be in violation of the code shall be given thirty (30) days to comply with the code by the code inspector. If an active building permit has not been obtained at the end of a thirty-day period or the boarding has not been removed and occupancy resumed, the owner, operator, or responsible party shall be issued a citation or a notice of violation to appear before the special magistrate or the unsafe structures board as needed. 
(c)  All buildings which are currently boarded without having acquired a building permit or town approval at the time such boarding occurred, shall at the time that this code is approved by the town council be required to obtain a boarding approval issued by the SET team and acquire a building permit from the town's building official. 
(d)  No person shall erect, install, place, or maintain boards over the doors, windows, or other openings of any building or structure, without first applying for a boarding approval issued by the SET team, and thereafter applying for and obtaining a valid and current building permit issued by the town's building official. 
(e)  The SET team shall review a boarding approval application upon its submission by the owner of the property, his/her agent or contractor and payment of the required administrative fee equal to two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) per each approved period. 
(f)  The boarding approval issued pursuant to this section shall authorize the applicant to proceed to application for a building permit; the boarding approval may only allow the boarding or securing of a building or structure for a period of no greater than six (6) months from the date such boarding approval is granted. When a property owner, or a representative or contractor, seeks renewal of the boarding approval, they must file a written request with the SET team no later than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the current boarding approval. Renewal of the SET team boarding approval may be considered for an additional six (6) months after the first six-month period has expired by the SET team upon the payment of an additional administrative fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) provided such extension is approved. However, in no case shall the boarding approval exceed a maximum time limit of one (1) year. If that time limit has been reached, and the building remains boarded, the property owner or representative shall be brought before the unsafe structures board and/or special magistrate and be required to demolish the building or correct all violations of the applicable codes and be subject to fines, liens and cost recovery fines. 
(g)  The owner, owner's agent, or contractor shall submit to the town building official, prior to the unsafe structures board hearing or special magistrate hearing, a detailed plan for the correction, repair, or rehabilitation of violations by the method used in the original construction and design of the building or structure that will enable the building to be occupied again, or alternatively, submit to the SET team, a detailed plan for sale of the property to another person or entity with provision in the sale agreement for the correction, repair, or rehabilitation of the property violation that will enable the building to be occupied again. All property sales or transfers of any ownership interests which may affect the status of the property and the correction of violations must adhere to those disclosure provisions found in Chapter 162, F.S. 
(h)  The owner, owner's agent, or contractor shall submit to the SET team, prior to the special magistrate hearing, a timeline for applying for all appropriate building or other town, county or state permits for correction, repair, or rehabilitation work and for completing such work prior to the expiration of the boarding approval renewal certificate, or alternatively, a timeline for the sale of the property. All property sales or transfers of any ownership interests which may affect the status of the property and the correction of violations must adhere to those disclosure provisions found in Chapter 162, F.S. 
(i)  The boarding approval may be revoked by the SET team if the owner fails to comply with the plan for such work, allows any permits or boarding approval to expire or fails to adhere to the submitted timeline. Additionally, if the owner, or owner's agent, has not complied with any requirements stated herein at the expiration of the first six (6) months' boarding approval, the property will be declared unsafe and a request to be demolished shall be presented to the unsafe structures board. 
(j)  A boarding approval may not be extended beyond the initial six-month period except upon demonstration that good cause for the renewed approval exists. Good cause shall require a showing of proof by the owner that the renewal is necessary due to conditions or events beyond the owner's control, such as the inability to obtain financing for repair or rehabilitation, inability to locate a suitable buyer, unanticipated delays in rehabilitation construction, or unanticipated damage to the property. 
(k)  In addition, where appropriate, good cause shall also require a showing by the owner that the owner has exercised reasonable and due diligence in attempting to complete the needed correction, repair, or rehabilitation, or is attempting to sell the property. If it is determined that there exists good cause to renew the certificate, the certificate may be renewed for a period of up to, but not more than, an additional six (6) months, subject to all of the same conditions imposed in the original renewal certificate. The renewal of the boarding approval will result in a maximum time period of one (1) year for the boarding of a building. However, in no case shall the boarding of a building exceed a one-year time limit, meaning that no additional six-month boarding certificates may be granted for the boarding of a building that has been boarded for one (1) year from the initial date of the boarding approval certificate. If that time limit has been reached, and the building remains boarded, the property will be declared unsafe and subsequently required to be demolished. When a building is to be demolished, the requirements that must be met for demolishing the building or structure are provided in section 6-37. 
(Ord. No. 2010-9, § 2(6-15.35), 4-7-10) 
Sec. 6-58. - Standards for securing a building. 
(a)  Compliance with town specifications. The boarding of the doors, windows, or other openings of any building or structure, or any means of securing such openings, other than by conventional method used in the original construction and design of the building or structure, shall comply with the specifications as required by the town. 
(b)  All utility service to the building or structure shall be terminated by removal of the meters and termination of electric power at the pole. Compliance with this subsection may be waived in writing by the town regarding electric service if electricity is needed to power exterior security lighting, an alarm system, or equipment to be used in connection with the rehabilitation of the building or structure for which there is an active and current building permit. 
(c)  The sewer shall be capped in a manner approved by the town so as to prevent the accumulation of methane gas in the building or structure. 
(d)  The interior of the building or structure shall be cleaned of all trash, junk, garbage, debris, and solid waste in accordance with applicable town franchise agreements. Personal possessions shall be removed from the interior of the building or structure, so as to eliminate any fire or health hazard and to prevent hindrance to firefighting equipment or personnel in the event of a fire. 
(e)  Exceptions: A SET team boarding approval shall not be required in the following circumstances: 
(1)  Temporary emergency situation, including, but not limited to, the boarding or shuttering necessary for the preparation of an approaching hurricane, or damage to a building or structure caused by the weather or fire, or as may be deemed appropriate by the enforcing agency. 
(Ord. No. 2010-9, § 2(6-15.37), 4-7-10) 
Sec. 6-59. - Boarding in hurricane season. 
    The owner or agent of any structure or building that has been boarded during hurricane season shall remove the boards or hurricane shutters no later than one (1) week after the end of the hurricane season. If the hurricane shutters have not been removed by that time, the structure or building will be considered to be in violation of code, except when the building, dwelling or structure has a SET team boarding approval and active building permit for the renovation thereof, or is subject to any exception found in this article. 
(Ord. No. 2010-9, § 2(6-15.37), 4-7-10) 
Sec. 6-60. - Costs incurred by the town and assessment of lien. 
    All costs incurred by the town based upon actions taken by the town to resolve violations of this article shall be charged and billed to the person in violation of this article and/or the property owner. Unless payment is made within thirty (30) days of such billing, the enforcing agency may levy such charges, to be assessed against the property as a lien in the amount of the charges outstanding which shall include applicable administrative costs and fees. Any liens levied in this manner shall be filed in the office of the town clerk, and in the public records of Broward County as a lien against the property and shall be prior in dignity to all other liens against the property, save and except a lien for taxes. Such assessments shall bear interest at the legal rate and such liens may be foreclosed in the same manner in which code enforcement and mortgage liens are foreclosed. 
(Ord. No. 2010-9, § 2(6-15.38), 4-7-10) 
Sec. 6-61. - Boarding and securing limitations. 
(a)  No owner shall board and secure any building subject to the provision of this section, without first obtaining a SET team boarding approval and a building permit after paying all the required fees. 
(b)  The building official may consider to waive fees when such boarding and securing is necessary as a result of natural disaster or fire. 
(c)  The enforcing agency shall examine the structure for compliance with the minimum standards and property maintenance code or any applicable state, or town ordinance or regulation.

(e)  The SET team shall monitor the building during the board and secure period. If at any time the SET team determines that the building, dwelling or structure's condition has deteriorated and the owner of the property is failing to maintain the premises, a special magistrate hearing shall be scheduled at the earliest time. 
(f)  If the building official shall determine that the cost of corrective measures for a particular property exceeds fifty (50) percent of the assessed value determined from the Broward County property appraiser's most recent property assessment, the building official or his representative may bring the owner of the property before the unsafe structures board in order to obtain prompt correction of the condition in full conformity with all applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2010-9, § 2(6-15.39), 4-7-10) 
Sec. 6-62. - Enforcement and penalties; recovery of unpaid civil penalties; unpaid penalty to constitute a lien; interest to be paid on liens; foreclosure; prohibition of the issuance of permits, licenses, certificates of use and occupancy, or zoning approvals to violators with unpaid civil penalties or liens. 
(a)  It shall be within the discretion of the enforcing agency to determine whether a violation of this section of the code shall be cited by direct citation, in accordance with the requirements of the code enforcement special magistrate, in accordance with the requirements of the unsafe structures board, or any other appropriate enforcement action permitted by the Town Code of Ordinances and/or any available legal remedy or methods.

(c)  The Town of Davie may institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to compel payment of civil penalties. 
(d)  A certified copy of an order imposing a civil penalty may be recorded in the Broward County public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists or upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator; and it may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property, but shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the town may foreclose or otherwise execute on the lien. 
(e)  Liens created pursuant to this article may be discharged and satisfied by paying to the Town of Davie the amount specified in the notice of lien, together with interest thereon from the date of the filing of the lien computed at the rate of twelve (12) percent per annum, together with the administrative costs, filing and recording fees and fees paid to file a satisfaction of the lien in the public records. When any such lien has been discharged, the Town of Davie shall promptly cause evidence of the satisfaction and discharge of such lien to be recorded in the public records. Any person, firm, corporation or legal entity, other than the present owner of the property involved, who pays any such unsatisfied lien shall be entitled to receive an assignment of the lien held by the town and shall be subrogated to the rights of the town in respect to the enforcement of such lien, as permitted by law. 
(f)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Code, no town officer, agent, employee or board shall approve, grant or issue any operating permit, license, building permit, certificate of use and occupancy, municipal local business tax receipt, platting action, or zoning action to any named violator with (i) unpaid civil penalties; (ii) unpaid administrative cost recovery fees; (iii) unpaid town enforcement costs; or (iv) unpaid liens, any or all of which are owed to the Town of Davie pursuant to the provisions of the Town of Davie Code of Ordinances, Broward County, Florida.

(b)  The permit shall be granted only if the fire chief or designee finds the organic material can be burned in safety, without the danger of causing harm or annoyance to the neighborhood, and upon an affirmative showing of good cause why the organic material must be burned instead of being hauled away. Either the fire chief or designee shall be the sole judge of good cause and safety in this regard. The permit fee and daily burning charges shall be determined by means of resolution enacted by the town council.

Sec. 7-84. - Revisions to fire protection assessments. 
    If any fire protection assessment made under the provisions of this article is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the town council is satisfied that any such fire protection assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the town council has failed to include or omitted any property on the assessment roll, which property should have been so included, the town council may take all necessary steps to impose a new fire protection assessment against any property benefited by the fire protection assessed costs, following as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of this article and in case such second fire protection assessment is annulled, vacated, or set aside, the town council may obtain and impose other fire protection assessments until a valid fire protection assessment is imposed. 
(Ord. No. 2013-16, § 2.10, 7-17-13) 
Sec. 7-85. - Procedural irregularities. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any fire protection assessment under the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any fire protection assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such fire protection assessment was duly levied, that the fire protection assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such fire protection assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this article; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. 
(Ord. No. 2013-16, § 2.11, 7-17-13) 
Sec. 7-86. - Correction of errors and omissions. 
(a)  No act of error or omission on the part of the property appraiser, tax collector, town administrator, town council, or their deputies or employees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of a fire protection assessment imposed by the town council under the provision of this article. 
(b)  When it shall appear that any fire protection assessment should have been imposed under this article against a parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of fire protection services, facilities, or programs, but that such property was omitted from the assessment roll; or such property was erroneously assessed; or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual parcel of property as of the effective date of the assessment roll approved by the annual rate resolution for any upcoming fiscal year, the town council may, upon provision of a notice by mail provided to the owner of the omitted or erroneously assessed parcel in the manner and form provided in section 7-79, impose the applicable fire protection assessment for the fiscal year in which such error or omission is discovered, in addition to the applicable fire protection assessment due for the prior two (2) fiscal years. Such fire protection assessment shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims in and to or against the real property involved, shall be collected as provided in division 3 hereof, and shall be deemed perfected on the date of adoption of the resolution imposing the omitted or delinquent assessments. 
(c)  Prior to the delivery of the assessment roll to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the town administrator shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property subject to a fire protection assessment, to reclassify property based upon presentation of competent and substantial evidence, and correct any error in applying the fire protection assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring the provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any such correction shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the fire protection assessment imposed under the provisions of this article. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the town administrator and not the property appraiser or tax collector. 
(d)  After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the tax roll upon timely written request and direction of the town administrator. 
(Ord. No. 2013-16, § 2.12, 7-17-13) 
Sec. 7-87. - Authorization for exemptions. 
(a)  The town council, in its sole discretion, shall determine on an annual basis whether to provide exemptions from payment of the fire protection assessment for government property or institutional property whose use is exempt from ad valorem taxation under Florida law. 
(b)  On an annual basis, the town council shall designate the funds available to provide any exemptions. The provision of an exemption in any one (1) year shall in no way establish a right or entitlement to such exemption in any subsequent year and the provision of funds in any year may be limited to the extent funds are available and appropriated by the town council. Any funds designated for exemptions shall be paid by the town from funds other than those generated by the fire protection assessment. 
(c)  Any shortfall in the expected fire protection assessment proceeds due to any exemption from payment of the fire protection assessments required by law or authorized by the town council shall be supplemented by any legally available funds, or combination of such funds, and shall not be paid for by proceeds or funds derived from the fire protection assessments. In the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines any exemption or reduction by the town council is improper or otherwise adversely affects the validity of the fire protection assessment imposed for any fiscal year, the sole and exclusive remedy shall be the imposition of a fire protection assessment upon each affected tax parcel in the amount of the fire protection assessment that would have been otherwise imposed save for such reduction or exemption afforded to such tax parcel by the town council. 
(Ord. No. 2013-16, § 2.13, 7-17-13) 
Sec. 7-88. - Interim assessments. 
(a)  An interim fire protection assessment may be imposed against all property, for which a building permit or certificate of occupancy, at the discretion of the town council, is issued after adoption of the annual rate resolution. The amount of the interim fire protection assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the annual rate for such property computed in accordance with the annual rate resolution for the fiscal year for which the interim fire protection assessment is being imposed. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the fiscal year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim fire protection assessment may also include an estimate of the subsequent fiscal year's fire protection assessment. No building permit or certificate of occupancy, at the discretion of the town council, shall be issued until full payment of the interim fire protection assessment is received by the town. Issuance of the building permit or certificate of occupancy, at the discretion of the town council, without the payment in full of the interim fire protection assessment shall not relieve the owner of such property of the obligation of full payment. Any interim fire protection assessment not collected prior to the issuance of the building permit or certificate of occupancy, at the discretion of the town council, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act as provided in section 7-89 of this article or by any other method authorized by law. Any interim fire protection assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the building permit or certificate of occupancy, at the discretion of the town council, was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved and shall be deemed perfected upon the issuance of the building permit or certificate of occupancy, at the discretion of the town council. 
(b)  In the event the town elects to collect the interim fire protection assessment at the time of building permit, the following procedures shall apply. 
(1)  In the event a building permit expires prior to completion of the building for which it was issued, and the applicant paid the interim fire protection assessment at the time the building permit was issued, the applicant may within ninety (90) days of the expiration of the building permit apply for a refund of the interim fire protection assessment. Failure to timely apply for a refund of the interim fire protection assessment shall waive any right to a refund. 
(2)  The application for refund shall be filed with the town administrator and contain the following: 
a.  The name and address of the applicant; 
b.  The location of the property and the tax parcel identification number for the property which was the subject of the building permit; 
c.  The date the interim fire protection assessment was paid; 
d.  A copy of the receipt of payment for the interim fire protection assessment; and 
e.  The date the building permit was issued and the date of expiration. 
(3)  After verifying that the building permit has expired and that the building has not been completed, the town shall refund the interim fire protection assessment paid for such building. 
(4)  A building permit which is subsequently issued for a building on the same property which was the subject of a refund shall pay the interim fire protection assessment as required by this section 7-88.

Sec. 12-5. - General rules of interpretation and definition. 
    Certain words used in these regulations have been defined in this chapter. Where this is the case, they shall have the meanings given in the applicable subsection. Where words have not been defined, the most recent edition of Webster's Unabridged Dictionary definitions shall prevail. Rules of interpretation shall follow the guidelines contained in section 12-501, Word Usage, and section 12-502, Abbreviations. 
    Administrators, judicial figures and other persons shall interpret this chapter based on an understanding of the purposes intended by the Town of Davie Town Council as noted in this chapter and in the Comprehensive Plan. The intent of the standards and supporting definitions is to protect both individual property owners and the general public from adverse impacts which might otherwise be the result of a proposed land use. To this end, those called upon to interpret this chapter shall proceed as follows: 
(A)  Determine the public purpose(s) of the standard(s) with respect to which an interpretation is required. 
Commentary: Before any zoning interpretation is made, there must be an explicit identification of the purpose(s) for which the regulation was initially imposed. Each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public. Each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable negative impact or potential. A sound interpretation of any such standard cannot be ensured without a careful analysis of the end to which the regulation is directed. 
(B)  Determine the actual impact of various proposed interpretations, permitting flexibility in design but prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public. 
Commentary: There is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use, or which allows a use to be enlarged, or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in this chapter. Design freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of standards is to be prohibited. 
(C)  Determine that the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that person's land use proposal. 
Commentary: If an interpretation would merely allow a design solution which is more flexible, albeit slightly different from the one expressly stated; and if it would result in no less a degree of protection to any affected party (either the adjoining landowners, the public at large or the property owner), such an interpretation may be appropriately made. Any interpretation which would result in an identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this chapter. Similarly, any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use, or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted, shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this chapter. Any interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted should only be made when the party interpreting this chapter has the power to impose additional restrictions or conditions to protect the public and exercises this power. 
(D)  This chapter has been carefully designed by the Town of Davie Town Council to avoid regulations that either sacrifice legitimate public goals, including the protection of adjoining property owners, or require undue limitations on the ability of property owners to use their land in manners consistent with the goals of the Comprehensive Plan for the town. Great care has been taken to both balance the rights of competing groups and achieve maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options.

(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90; Ord. No. 91-33, 9-4-91) 
Sec. 12-24. - Statement of purpose and intent of zoning districts. 
    The following sections specify the purpose and intent of the zoning districts established by this chapter: 
(A)  Agricultural (AG) District: This district is intended to maintain, preserve and protect areas of the Town of Davie that are predominately in agricultural uses, and/or have historically demonstrated agriculture productivity. This district is designed to protect the agricultural industry from scattered residential development that displaces agricultural uses from substantial areas of productive agricultural land for a limited number of dwelling units by providing for lots on an acre in size or larger. This district is intended to maintain the rural character of the town and implement the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan. 
(B)  Rural Ranches (RR) District: This district is intended to protect areas of the Town of Davie, characterized by their rural or semi-rural, predominantly residential and very-low-density characteristics, from intrusive nonresidential uses and higher-density residential development which would be inconsistent with their established character. The district is also intended to permit continued agricultural and residential-agricultural use of land. The RR District implements the Agricultural and Residential one (1) dwelling unit per acre classifications of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan. 
(C)  Suburban (S) District: The Suburban (S) District is intended to provide for open space living in the areas identified for residential densities of between two (2) and five (5) dwelling units per acre in the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan. This district permits a variety of dwelling unit types to facilitate the provision of open space. The district is intended for use on large tracts and not as in-fill on properties less than ten (10) acres in areas surrounded by zoning of equal or lower density. 
(D)  Suburban Commercial (SC) District: The Suburban Commercial (SC) District is intended for properties west of Pine Island Road where commercial uses are anticipated. It is intended to provide a less restrictive, more open form of commercial development in the western part of the Town of Davie that is compatible with the lower residential densities called for in that area. 
(E)  Urban Commercial (UC) District: The Urban Commercial (UC) District is intended to provide for a mix of retail, office and residential uses in a medium to high-density environment. Areas so designated in the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan will have some open space requirements to complement the higher densities permitted in the district. 
(F)  Freeway Business (FB) District: The Freeway Business (FB) District is intended to be used to create an open type of mixed use business development with office, retail and residential uses in the same building. These uses are to be surrounded by substantial areas of open space. Employment of this district should reduce traffic by creating viable mixed use areas, provide a quality living environment, and access to open lands for recreation. The open space provided in this district will be a natural transition to lower density residential areas. 
(G)  Business Park (BP) District: The Business Park (BP) District is intended to be used to promote modern campus types of industrial, office, distribution and service business areas where a wide variety of uses can be built in an attractive environment with substantial open areas on the periphery of the development. 
(H)  Transportation (T) District: The Transportation (T) District is intended to implement the transportation category of the Future Land Use Plan. This district generally permits uses directly related to the development of transportation facilities and allows certain temporary uses that do not adversely affect, and may facilitate, the future development of a transportation use. 
(I)  Neighborhood Conservation Districts: The Neighborhood Conservation Districts are intended for existing residentially zoned areas. They are designed to prevent these areas from becoming nonconforming as they would if they would be placed in the other districts in this chapter. These districts are also intended to provide for the minor infilling of existing neighborhoods consistent with their zoning and character at the time of the enactment of this chapter. Such neighborhoods are relatively uniform in character and are generally stable. The regulations permit future development consistent with existing neighborhood character. Areas identified as having a stable and fixed character will be allowed to continue to exist and develop under the general regulations governing their design and construction or under the actual subdivision plat previously approved. 
    Neighborhood Conservation Districts consist of four (4) general types: The Residential Single-Family, the Multifamily, the Mobile Home, and the existing Planned Residential Developments (the PRD district is no longer available for new development). The single-family type is generally for the single-family detached dwellings and is comprised of six (6) districts based upon lot size: A-1, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4 and R-5. The Multifamily type is comprised of six (6) districts as follows: RM-5, RM-8, RM-10, RM-12, RM-16, and RM-22. The mobile home type is comprised of five (5) districts: MH-1, MH-3, MH-5, MH-8, and MH-10. The A-1 District, while considered a residential dwelling district, does permit limited agricultural uses. For the limitations applying to agricultural uses in this district, see article III (Use regulations). 
(1)  Agricultural (A-1) District: The A-1 District is intended to implement the agricultural and residential one (1) unit per acre classifications of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan and to maintain, protect and encourage the continuance of a productive agricultural community in Davie by ensuring that developments are buffered from existing agricultural uses. 
(2)  Estate Dwelling (R-1) District: The R-1 District is intended to implement the one (1) dwelling unit per acre residential classification of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan and to provide estate residential areas with most of the noncommercial agricultural uses permitted providing a transition from agricultural land to residential dwelling units. 
(3)  Low Density Dwelling (R-2 and R-3) Districts: The R-2 and R-3 Districts are intended to implement the three (3) dwelling units per acre residential classification of the Town of Davie Future Land Use Plan and the residential classification of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan by providing for low density dwelling districts in the town. 
(4)  Low Medium Density Dwelling (R-4, R-5 and RM-5) Districts: The R-4, R-5 and RM-5 Districts are intended to implement the five (5) dwelling units per acre residential classification of the Town of Davie Future Land Use Plan and the residential classification of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan by providing for a low-medium density single-family dwelling district. 
(5)  Medium Density Dwelling (RM-8 and RM-10) Districts: The RM-8 and RM-10 Districts are intended to implement the ten (10) dwelling units per acre residential classification of the Town of Davie Future Land Use Plan and the residential classification of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan by providing for medium density multiple family dwelling districts in the Town of Davie. 
(6)  Medium-High Density Dwelling (RM-12 and RM-16) Districts: The RM-12 and RM-16 Districts are intended to implement the sixteen (16) dwelling units per acre residential classification of the Town of Davie Future Land Use Plan and the residential classification of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan by providing for medium-high density multiple-family dwelling districts in the Town of Davie. 
(7)  High Density Dwelling (RM-22) District: The RM-22 District is intended to implement the twenty-two (22) dwelling units per acre residential classification of the Town of Davie Future Land Use Plan and the residential classification of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan by providing for a high density multiple-family dwelling district in the Town of Davie. 
(J)  Commercial Conservation Districts: These districts are intended to preserve the character of existing commercial areas, neighborhoods and developments either in existence or under construction at the time of adoption of this chapter. The district is the commercial version of the Neighborhood Conservation District. The district permits these areas to continue to develop in commercial uses but requires better landscaping and vehicular access control. 
(1)  Residential/Office (RO) District. The RO District is intended to implement the residential/office classification of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan by providing a buffer of professional offices and mixed residential and office development to surrounding residential areas. The intent of this district is to maintain the residential character of the neighborhood while permitting the development of professional offices. 
(2)  Office (O) District. The O District is intended to implement the office classification of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan by providing encouragement toward the development of a business and research office park with complimentary retail and service uses in an open and attractive manner. 
(3)  Commerce Center (CC) District. The CC District is intended to implement the commerce/office classification of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan by providing for development of office, research, business and light industrial complexes at suitable locations throughout the town. A commerce center development may serve as a major source of employment and will complement the appearance and welfare of the town. This district contains regulations designed to promote flexibility in planning and design. 
(4)  Neighborhood Business (B-1) District. The B-1 District is intended to implement the commercial designation of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan by providing for a business area to service the local neighborhood shopping and personal service needs of a limited surrounding residential area. Retail stores permitted herein are intended to include mainly convenience goods which are usually a daily necessity for a residential neighborhood. 
(5)  Community Business (B-2) District. The B-2 District is intended to implement the commercial designation of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan by providing for a business area to service the shopping and limited service needs of several neighborhoods or the local community.

(5.1)  Community Business Marine (B-2M) District. The B-2M District is intended to implement the commercial designation of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan by providing limited commercial marine services as well as residential and other shopping and service needs in a manner which is not in conflict with commercial marine services. Compatible residential is also allowed by special permit. 
(6)  Planned Business Center (B-3) District. The B-3 District is intended to implement the commercial designation of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan by providing for a business area to meet the shopping and service needs of large sections of the town or metropolitan areas. Such business generally requires considerable ground area, do not cater directly to pedestrians, and need a conspicuous and accessible location convenient for motorists. 
(K)  Industrial Districts. 
(1)  Light Industrial (M-1) District. The M-1 District is intended to implement the industrial classification of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan by providing for light industrial uses, such as research, development or fabrication of products, which make use of processes not likely to be objectionable to neighborhood properties because of noise, vibration, odors, smoke, air pollution, or other physical manifestations. 
(2)  Medium Industrial (M-2) District. The M-2 District is intended to implement the industrial classification of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan by providing for medium industrial uses which, by their inherent nature or by virtue of the materials used, processes utilized or products produced, may involve some characteristics objectionable to or incompatible with residential areas. Hence, M-2 districts are not intended for locations abutting residential property. 
(3)  Planned Industrial Park (M-3) District. The M-3 District is intended to implement the industrial classification of the Town of Davie Comprehensive Plan by providing for planned industrial parks which can accommodate light, medium or selected heavier industrial uses in an open, uncrowded and attractive manner through limitations on setbacks and coverage, and for other permitted uses.

(B)  Blasting: 
(1)  Adoption of Broward County Blasting Ordinance. Broward County Ordinance No. 79-63, as adopted and amended, including any and all revisions made subsequent to this date, including policy statements, is hereby adopted as if set forth herein, and the whole of the ordinance and amendments or revisions are hereby declared to be a part of this Code of Ordinances. 
(2)  Definitions. All terms used in this article, unless otherwise defined, shall be construed to be the common definition. 
Blaster. A person employed by a user who detonates or otherwise effects the explosion of an explosive or who is in immediate personal charge and supervision of one (1) or more other persons engaged in such activity. 
Blasting agent. Any material or mixture, consisting of a fuel and oxidizer, intended for blasting, not otherwise classified as an explosive, in which none of the ingredients is classified as an explosive; provided, that the finished product, as mixed and packaged for use or shipment, cannot be detonated by means of a No. 8 test blasting cap when unconfined. Materials or mixtures classified as nitro carbo nitrates by department of transportation regulations shall be included in this definition. 
Explosives. Any mixture, compound or material capable of producing an explosion, including, but not limited to, dynamite, nitroglycerin, trinitrotoluene, blasting caps and detonators, but not including fireworks. 
User. The person who, as ultimate consumer of an explosive, purchases same from a dealer or manufacturer/distributor, or acquires the possession of any explosive by any other means. A user shall be licensed in the name of one or more individuals who shall be licensed in accordance with the procedures outlined in section 12-19 of Broward County Ordinance No. 79-63. No sales will be made to users unless authorized by a licenses individual. 
(3)  Blasting prohibited; exceptions: 
(a)  It shall be unlawful to blast in the Town of Davie except as required for drainage canals and utility systems. Such activities shall be in strict conformance with the provisions of subsection (4) below. Blasting and use of explosives may not be used in conjunction with excavation activities. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful to blast in the Town of Davie when such blasting would result in a monthly averaged vector sum particle velocity of four-tenths (0.4) inch per second as defined in section 12-38 of Broward County Ordinance 79-63. However, the maximum vector sum particle velocity that shall be allowed is 0.50 inch per second, or less, as any amendments to Broward County Ordinance 79-63 may reflect. The vector sum particle velocity shall be measured on the ground at the nearest building or structure not owned by the user or, when measured at a distance of five thousand two hundred eighty (5,280) feet from the blast, when the nearest structure not owned by the user is more distance than one (1) mile from the blast. Deviation from the maximum vector sum particle velocity of 0.50 inch per second shall be accepted by the development services director upon certification by the seismologist and verification by the special inspector that a higher particle velocity will not exceed guidelines set forth for thresholds of damage per the U.S. Bureau of Mines. 
(4)  Permit for blasting: 
(a)  The town may grant a permit for blasting only after an application therefor has been submitted accompanied by the following: 
1.  A location sketch and a plot plan to show the property owned by the applicant with reference to contiguous streets, highways and platted areas, showing thereon the proposed land development, with cross-sections to show elevations prior to development as well as approximate elevations after development. The plans, maps, elevations and cross-sections required by this section shall be made and sealed by a surveyor or engineer registered as such by the State of Florida. 
2.  An opinion letter from a person qualified and experienced in local geology that blasting is required on the property owned by the applicant in order for excavation and development to occur. The opinion letter shall be accompanied by appropriate geologic tests. 
3.  A preliminary report of the type of blasting to be performed, including the type and amount of explosives for each blast or delay series, delay interval, arrangements and spacing of charges, and names and qualifications of persons in charge of loading and firing and persons responsible for maintaining instrument readings and persons responsible for response to complaints. 
4.  After the initial blasting has occurred on the site, the owner shall submit to the town a report as to the conformance of the actual blasting indicated in item 3. above. If there are changes in the proposed blasting report due to the geology of the site, the owner shall submit to the town a new blasting report. 
5.  The town may require, at the option of the director of development services, that the owner engage the services of a special inspector, approved by the town and familiar with blasting procedures, to supervise and observe the blasting operations. The special inspector shall verify through the placement of seismographs at predetermined location, or where required by resident, the monthly average vector sum particle velocity as well as the maximum vector sum particle velocity for all blasts performed under each permit issued by the town. The special inspector's fee shall be paid for by the owner. 
(b)  A permit granted pursuant to the above shall be subject to limitations and conditions as: 
1.  Days and hours when blasting may be performed. 
2.  The duration of the permit. 
3.  Verification that the applicant possesses public liability insurance. Proof of insurance shall be submitted to the town prior to the start of blasting operations, in an amount not less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) per person and five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) per occurrence. An excess umbrella policy shall be provided in an amount not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00). The amount of insurance necessary shall be determined by the following formula: 
I=  U 
0.4 (Bm + Bn) 
I = Insurance factor. U = Number of residential or nonresidential units within a one-mile radius of the property. Bm = Magnitude of blast expressed in pounds of explosives used per hole per event. Bn = Number of blasts expressed in actual number of detonations per event.  
4.  The plan provided by the owner shall be used in determining the variables to be used in the above formula. Title insurance to be carried by the owner shall be calculated by using the following formula: 
I value Coverage 0.00-0.50 $1,000,000.00 0.51-1.00  2,000,000.00 1.01-3.00  3,000,000.00 3.01-4.00  4,000,000.00 4.01 and up  5,000,000.00  
5.  The development services department shall be notified a minimum of forty-eight (48) hours prior to commencement of blasting. 
6.  Verification that the blasting activity has not resulted in a monthly averaged vector sum particle velocity in excess of four-tenths (0.4) inch per second, as defined in section 12-38 of Broward County Ordinance No. 79-63, when measured at the closest structure not owned by the user or, when measured at a distance of five thousand two hundred eighty (5,280) feet from the blast, when the nearest structure not owned by title user is more distant than one (1) mile from the blast. 
7.  A preblast survey shall be conducted by the owner on those properties which, in the opinion of the special inspector, would be directly affected by the blasting. 
(5)  Violations. Violations include failure to perform any requirement set forth in this article or in the event of any of the following circumstances occur: 
(a)  Noncompliance with any condition placed upon the permit. 
(b)  In the event that instrument readings verify blasting activities not in accordance with this article. 
(c)  Violation by the applicant or designee of any provision of any explosives law or regulation; or in the event that false information was given or misrepresentation was made to obtain the permit. 
(6)  Penalties for violations. The director of development services is hereby authorized to penalize permittees for violations. The penalty for violation shall be made in the following manner: 
(a)  Upon initial violation, the permit holder shall be formally notified of the violation and shall be required to immediately conform with the provisions of this article. 
(b)  Upon a second infraction of this article, the permit holder shall be fined in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00). 
(c)  A third violation shall result in the immediate suspension of the permit and, upon review by the approving authority, revocation if warranted.

DIVISION 3. - SITE CAPACITY ANALYSIS 

Sec. 12-56. - Site capacity calculations. 
    The maximum intensity of use in any zoning district is controlled by the maximum intensity set forth in section 12-53 for residential uses and in section 12-54 for nonresidential uses or the provisions of this division, whichever is less. 
Commentary: Because landforms, parcel size and shape, as well as natural or engineered limitations, vary significantly from site to site, reasonable development regulations must take account of these variations. The former Davie Zoning Ordinance did not provide any mechanism to relate such site-specific variables, forcing the town to rely on zoning negotiations to protect the environment. The town has found this has not always resulted in protection of the natural resources. This inadequacy resulted in problems such as the destruction of natural resources, pollution of ground and surface water, and destruction of wildlife habitats. This chapter is intended to correct this problem by directly tying the intensity of development to the natural capacity of the site. For each tract, the calculations contained in sections 12-58 and 12-59 shall be made. (The worksheets on the following pages outline the procedure for completing the required calculations.) 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90; Ord. No. 2017-023, § 2(Exh. A), 8-2-17) 
Sec. 12-57. - Applicability. 
    All developments shall calculate the capacity of the site before the issuance of a building permit, except for those developments specifically noted below: 
(1)  Any single-family development with lots in excess of five (5) acres where the land is subject to restrictive covenants limiting that density in perpetuity; and, 
(2)  Any existing legal lots of record in Neighborhood Conservation districts, or in residential developments platted prior to the date of the adoption of this chapter; and 
(3)  Any nonresidential lots of record in a subdivision platted prior to the adoption of this chapter or having a lot area of less than one (1) acre; and, 
(4)  Any lots created by a subdivision or land development approved under this chapter and having met the requirements of this division during the platting or land development approval process. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90; Ord. No. 91-33, 9-4-91) 
Sec. 12-58. - Base site area calculations (for all and uses). 
(A) Gross site area as determined by actual on-site survey. _____ acres (B) Subtract land constituting easements or rights-of-way for public or private roads, utility primary transmission lines, and Water Management or Drainage District Canals. -  _____ acres (C) Subtract land which is not contiguous:  (1) 
A separate parcel which does not abut, adjoin or share common boundaries with the rest of the development. -  _____ acres  (2) 
Land which is cut off from the main parcel by a road, railroad, existing land uses or major stream, such that common use is hindered or that the land is unavailable for building purposes. -  _____ acres (D) Subtract land which in a previously approved subdivision encompassing the same land, as part or all of the subject parcel, was reserved for resource protection reasons (e.g. flooding) or for recreation. -  _____ acres (E) Subtract land used or proposed for residential uses, whenever both nonresidential and residential uses are proposed. (In the case of the site capacity calculation for the proposed residential use, subtract the land proposed for nonresidential use.) -  _____ acres (F) Equals base site area.[1] =  _____ acres  
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90; Ord. No. 91-33, 9-4-91) 
Sec. 12-59. - Natural resources calculations. 
    All land area consisting of the natural resources or natural features listed below, lying within the BASE SITE AREA, shall be measured. The total acreage of each resource shall be multiplied by its respective open space ratio to determine the amount of resource protection land or area required to be kept in open space in order to protect the resource or feature. The sum total of all resource protection land on the site equals TOTAL RESOURCE PROTECTION LAND. (See the worksheets on the following pages.) 
(1)  Measure the areas of the site containing the NATURAL RESOURCES listed below. These features are defined in Article XIV. Calculate the required areas of RESOURCE PROTECTION LAND for each feature:

Sec. 12-66. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2017-023, § 2(Exh. A), adopted August 2, 2017, repealed § 12-66. Former § 12-66 pertained to archaeological sites and derived from Ord. No. 90-4, adopted February 21, 1990. 
DIVISION 5. - MITIGATION 

Sec. 12-67. - Mitigation. 
    In some cases, the resources may be mitigated, thus permitting the higher level of disturbance than otherwise permitted by section 12-60 or section 12-56. The resources where mitigation is permitted are wetlands, canal buffers, and citrus groves. When there is to be mitigation, the provisions of this division or other regulating or permitting agencies, whichever is stricter, shall be used. The following are the provisions for mitigation. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90; Ord. No. 2017-023, § 2(Exh. A), 8-2-17)

(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90) 
Sec. 12-69. - Hardwood hammocks. 
    Since hardwood hammocks are rare in the town and quite small in extent, mitigation is undesirable. However, subject to the provisions of this section, some mitigation is permitted: 
(1)  The mitigation shall be demonstrated to be essential to the layout and design of the property. That is, the developer shall demonstrate, at a special permit hearing, that, because of its location and other standards of this chapter as applied to that particular site, to leave the hammock intact would make it impossible to approach the density or intensity of use permitted in section 12-56. 
(2)  The mitigation shall be a 2:1; that is, for every one (1) acres of hammock disturbed, there shall be two (2) new acres of hammock restored. 
(3)  The mitigation area shall be restored using thirty (30) plant units per acre. 
(4)  All species used in the mitigation shall be native to south Florida hardwood hammocks. The landscape plan shall be approved by the town's urban forester for species and planting to achieve a hammock. The size of fifty (50) percent of the canopy trees and understory trees shall be five (5) inches and three (3) inches, respectively. 
(5)  The mitigation area shall be located where it either benefits the town's open space plan or where it enhances the highway frontage and is visible to town residents. It shall not adjoin any interstate highway or a municipal boundary, unless it is approved as an entrance feature for the town. 
(6)  The developer shall place easements on the mitigation area protecting the area from further development. Said easements shall run in favor of the town. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90) 
Sec. 12-70. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2017-023, § 2(Exh. A), adopted August 2, 2017, repealed § 12-70. Former § 12-70 pertained to archaeological sites and derived from Ord. No. 90-4, adopted February 21, 1990. Similar provisions can be found in div. 7. 
Sec. 12-71. - Fee in lieu of mitigation. 
    Particularly on small sites where there is little room for mitigation on-site, but also on larger sites at the town's discretion, the Town of Davie may accept a fee in lieu of the actual mitigation. Such fee shall provide for the acquisition of land in accordance with the town's Open Space Plan. The fee shall cover the cost of acquiring the land at appraised values of the land programmed for acquisition and the actual installation of the plant materials or other components of the required mitigation. The fee shall also include a one-time donation to fund the maintenance for a twenty-year period. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90) 
DIVISION 6. - OPEN SPACE 

Sec. 12-72. - Open space uses, limitations. 
    The open space land in open space developments, excluding open space design development as stated in section 12-290, or planned developments may include active and passive recreational areas, natural areas, citrus groves, bufferyards, stormwater retention areas, trails and areas intended to provide amenities to surrounding uses. A maximum of fifteen (15) percent of the required open space may contain permitted recreational structures, such as community stalls, clubhouses, pools, playgrounds. 
    In open space design developments, no more than ten (10) percent of the required open space shall contain waterbodies. 
    The amount of water surface in the open space shall be limited to fifteen (15) percent of the site; the remaining open space shall meet the requirements of net dry land area. While increased water surface area may be desired as a result of site size, site or the existence of natural resources, no variations in lot standards or minimum requirements are permitted to make up for the increased area. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90; Ord. No. 91-33, 9-4-91; Ord. No. 2002-34, § 1, 10-16-02) 
Sec. 12-73. - Exemption of publicly owned open space lands. 
    Lands which have been acquired by the town pursuant to its open space program or have otherwise been acquired by the town for open space purposes and are owned by the town in fee simple are exempt from the requirements of this chapter as it may be amended from time to time, such chapter being known as the land development code. Any open space lands that are conveyed out of the name of the town shall cease to be exempt from the land development code.

d.  The site, building, structure, object, or district has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history; or 
e.  The site, building, structure, object, or district has achieved significance within the last fifty (50) years as a result of the extraordinary importance of an event that occurred at the site on a local, state, or national level; the fragility of the resource; the community's strong associative attachment to the resource; or the significance of a building's architecture or architect; or 
f.  The archaeological site is located within an archaeological zone, the site has been previously recorded with the Florida Master Site file, and the town has made a good-faith effort to obtain access to the property to conduct a reconnaissance level archaeological survey, but access to the property has been denied. 
(3)  Interior spaces shall not be designated unless the interiors have exceptional architectural, artistic, or historic importance, and are customarily open to the public. 
(4)  A resource must be at least fifty (50) years of age or, if less than fifty (50) years old, must possess exceptional importance. 
a.  The following procedures shall be used in determining eligibility of an individual historic resource or a historic district: 
(1)  A site, building, structure, object, or district may be nominated for designation using a historic designation application form, available from the HPO, and shall be completed by the applicant and returned to the HPO. 
(2)  An owner of a nominated property, site, building, structure, object, or district, the board, the Town, or the historic preservation board, upon its own motion, may make application to the historic preservation board for consideration of a property, site, building, structure, object, or district as a historic resource. 
(3)  The boundaries of a historic resource or historic district shall be described in a legal description in the historic designation application. The boundaries of the historic designation site shall be established as follows: 
a.  For designation of an individual historic resource, the boundary shall be the original site as it was associated with the nominated historic resource during its period of significance. If a portion of the original site containing the historic resource has been sold or developed, that portion of the site that is currently associated with the historic resource shall constitute the boundary. 
b.  For a historic district, the boundary shall be the geographic perimeter of the grouping of sites and properties included in the district. 
(4)  Upon receipt of a completed application form, including necessary documentation, the HPO shall review the application for completeness and accuracy. Once determined complete and accurate by the HPO, the nomination shall be placed on the agenda of the next available, regularly scheduled meeting of the historic preservation board.

(6)  Whether additions to historic resources are sited as inconspicuously as reasonably possible and, with the exception of waterfront properties, towards the rear. All additions shall be designed to complement the historic resource in terms of scale, shape, and materials, while at the same time being readable as differentiated from and compatible with the old work. 
(g)  Additional requirements relating to request to relocate a historic resource: In approving or denying applications for a COA for relocation of a historic resource, the historic preservation board, in addition to the general criteria listed in subsection (d) above, shall consider the following: 
(1)  Whether the relocation will affect the contribution the building or structure makes to its present setting.

(5)  If an application for demolition of a COA for a historic resource is filed, the approval of the COA for demolition shall be a prerequisite to the issuance of any other town permits for a historic resource. However, the issuance of a COA for a demolition shall not occur until all other approvals required for the redevelopment of the subject site by The Town of Davie, and any other jurisdiction, are issued. If no approvals are required for the redevelopment, the issuance of a COA for a demolition shall not occur until the preliminary permit is issued by The Town of Davie, and any other jurisdiction, for any ground disturbance for the redevelopment of the subject site. 
(i)  Application for economic hardship exception: Where, by reason of particular site conditions and restraints, or because of unusual circumstances applicable solely to a particular historic resource or site upon which a resource is located, strict enforcement of the provisions of this article would result in the deprivation of all reasonable economically beneficial use of the historic resource or site upon which the resource is located, the historic preservation board shall vary or modify adherence to this article; provided always that its decision shall ensure harmony with the general purposes of this article and will not adversely affect The Town of Davie.

Sec. 12-102. - Florida-friendly landscaping. 
(A)  General Provisions. Within the Town of Davie the principles of Florida-friendly landscaping shall be incorporated into all landscape designs. These include the following: 
1.  Preserving existing native trees and vegetation, if feasible. Where established natural vegetation is incorporated into the landscape design, irrigation of those areas shall not be required. 
2.  The plant palette and irrigation system shall be appropriate for site conditions, taking into account that, in some cases, soil improvements can enhance water use efficiency. Drought resistant plants are emphasized. 
3.  Plants shall be grouped together by irrigation demand. 
4.  The percentage of landscaped area in irrigated high water use hydrozones shall be minimized. The maximum percentage of irrigated landscape area that may be included in high water use hydrozones, excluding turfgrass, shall not exceed twenty (20) percent. These high water use limits shall not apply to landscaped areas requiring large amounts of turf for their primary functions, e.g., ball fields and playgrounds. 
5.  Soil improvements are encouraged to improve the soil with organic materials prior to the installation of any irrigation system. 
6.  An efficient irrigation system shall be required and designed according to the water needs of the planting groups. 
7.  Reclaimed or non-potable water should be used for irrigation if an acceptable source is determined to be available by the Town Utilities Department. If such reclaimed water or non-potable water is available from the Town to service a site, a local water provider, if different than the Town, shall allow such use of reclaimed water, unless prohibited by Statute. 
8.  Low impact design principles such as bio-swales, bio-retention areas and other creative stormwater management techniques. 
(B)  Design Standards. 
1.  Site designs and landscape construction documents shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of all applicable Florida Statutes. All landscape and irrigation system design shall be consistent with the standards required under [Section] 373.228, Florida Statutes. 
2.  Site Plans shall consider natural drainage features to minimize run-off. The use of pervious surfaces and areas is preferred; therefore impervious surface and material within landscaped areas shall be limited to borders, sidewalks, step stones and other similar material and shall not exceed 10% of the landscaped areas. Use of pervious paving material for driveways and sidewalks is strongly encouraged. A maintenance plan may be required for certain pervious products to ensure that they remain pervious in the long term. 
Gravel, river rock, shell and similar material shall not be used as major landscape ground cover or mulch. In no case shall these materials exceed 10% of the landscape area as they increase the need for herbicide use, have no habitat value, reflect rather than absorb heat and do not produce oxygen like plants. 
3.  Site plans shall detail, at a minimum, all vegetated areas to be preserved by species.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 12-200. - General purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide standards for the design of parking lots, the required amount of off-street parking and off-street loading requirements. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90) 
Sec. 12-201. - Off-street parking required. 
(A)  Every building, use or structure instituted or erected after the effective date of this chapter shall be provided with off-street parking facilities in accordance with the provisions of this article for the use of occupants, employees, visitors or patrons. 
(B)  Such off-street parking facilities shall be maintained and continued as an accessory use as long as the main use is continued. 
(C)  Where a building existed at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter was derived, such building may be modernized, altered or repaired, provided there is no increase in floor area or capacity and there is no change of occupancy without providing additional off-street parking facilities. 
(D)  Where a building or use, which existed at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter was derived, is enlarged in floor area, volume, capacity or space occupied, off-street parking facilities as specified herein shall be provided for the additional floor area, volume, capacity or space so created or occupied. 
(E)  Where a building or use which existed at the effective date of this chapter is changed in use or occupancy, additional off-street parking facilities shall be provided to the extent that the off-street parking required by this chapter for the new use or occupancy exceeds the off-street parking which would have been required for the previous use or occupancy had the regulations of this article been applicable thereto. For the purposes of this section, a "change of use or occupancy" shall mean a change from one category of off-street parking requirements to another such category under section 12-208. 
(F)  It shall be unlawful for an owner or operator of any building, structure or use affected by this article to discontinue, change or dispense with or to cause the discontinuance or reduction of the required parking facilities apart from the discontinuance, sale or transfer of such structure or use without establishing alternative vehicle parking facilities which meet the requirements of this article. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to utilize such building, structure or use without providing the off-street parking facilities to meet the requirements of and be in compliance with this article. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90) 
Sec. 12-202. - Location, character and size. 
(A)  The off-street parking facilities required by this article shall be located on the same plot or parcel of land they are intended to serve; provided, however, when practical difficulties, as determined by the council, prevent the establishment of such facilities upon the same plot, the off-street parking facilities shall be provided on land within seven hundred (700) feet of the premises they are to serve, and the owner of said parking area shall enter into written arrangement with the Town whereby the land providing the parking area shall never be sold or disposed of except in conjunction with the sale of the building the parking area serves so long as these parking facilities are required, and said agreement shall be recorded at the expense of the owner and shall run with the land to bind the heirs, successors and assigns of said owner. Said written agreement may be voided by the Town Council if other provisions are made for off-street parking facilities pursuant to this article. 
(B)  The required off-street parking facilities shall be identified as to purpose and as to location when not clearly evident from a street or alley. Off-street parking facilities including access aisles and driveways shall be surfaced with a hard, dustless material and maintained in a smooth, well-graded condition; provided, that driveways, access aisles and parking spaces for certain uses may be surfaced with grass or lawn as provided by section 12-209(E). 
(C)  All off-street parking facilities required by this article shall be drained so as not to cause any nuisance on adjacent or public property, and any lighting thereon shall be so arranged and designed as to prevent any glare spacing or excessive light on adjacent property. Such facilities shall be arranged for convenient access and safety of pedestrians and vehicles. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90) 
Sec. 12-203. - Driveways. 
(A)  Driveways shall be considered as constituting off-street parking spaces for single-family and two-family duplex dwellings in residential districts; provided that, sufficient spaces are available on such driveways to meet the requirements of this article.

No. 2015-017, adopted June 10, 2015; Ord. No. 2016-014, adopted July 27, 2016 

Sec. 12-230. - Scope, purpose and severability. 
(A)  Scope. 
(1)  The provisions of this division shall govern the number, size, location, and character of all signs which may be permitted either as a main or accessory use under the terms of this division. No signs shall be permitted on a plot or parcel either as a main or accessory use except in accordance with the provisions of this division. 
(2)  This division does not regulate government signs on property owned by the Town of Davie or the State of Florida and does not regulate traffic control devices. 
(3)  The town specifically finds that these sign regulations are narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling and substantial governmental interests of traffic safety and aesthetics, and that there is no other way for the town to further these interests. 
(B)  Purpose. 
(1)  Florida Constitution. Article II, Section 7 of the Florida Constitution provides that "[i]t shall be the policy of the state to conserve and protect its natural resources and scenic beauty..." A beautiful environment preserves and enhances the desirability of the town as a place to live and to do business. Implementing the Florida Constitution is a compelling governmental interest. 
(2)  Florida Statutes. Florida law requires municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans and implement them through land development regulations and approval of development orders that are consistent with the comprehensive plan. See F.S. Chapter 163, Part II. Florida law specifically requires that the town adopt sign regulations. See F.S. § 163.3202(2)(f). Complying with state law is a compelling governmental interest. 
(3)  Town comprehensive plan goals, objectives and policies. The town's state-mandated comprehensive plan includes the following policies in regard to sign regulation: 
(a)  Policy 3-1 of the future land use element provides that, among other things, the land development regulations must contain minimum criteria for signage that shall be applied at the time of development approval. 
(b)  Policy 20-4 of the future land use element provides that the land development regulations shall address the size, quantity, location and character of on-premises and off-premises signs to promote community aesthetics and protect the health, safety and welfare of town residents and to address nonconforming signs. 
(4)  Case law. In accordance with the U.S. Supreme Court's cases on sign regulation, the regulations in this division are not intended to regulate or censor speech based on its content or viewpoint, but rather to regulate the secondary effects of speech that may adversely affect the town's substantial and compelling governmental interests in preserving scenic beauty and community aesthetics, and in vehicular and pedestrian safety in conformance with the First Amendment. These cases and their holdings include, but are not limited to: 
(a)  Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 135 S. Ct. 2218 (2015) on the topic on noncommercial temporary signs; 
(b)  Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981) on the topic of commercial signs and off-premise signs; 
(c)  City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43 (1994) on the topic of political protest signs in residential areas; 
(d)  Linmark Assocs., Inc. v. Township of Willingboro, 431 U.S. 85 (1977) on the topic of real estate signs in residential areas; 
(e)  Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191 (1992) on the topic of election signs near polling places; 
(f)  Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, 447 U.S. 557 (1980) on the topic of commercial speech; and 
(g)  City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) on the topic of signs on Public Property or a Public Place. 
(5)  Impact of sign clutter. Excessive signage and sign clutter impair the legibility of the environment, and undermines the effectiveness of governmental signs, traffic control devices and other required signs (such as building, unit or house number signs, street identification signs, and building identity signs) that are essential to identifying locations for the delivery of emergency services and other compelling governmental purposes. The intent of these sign regulations is to enhance the visual environment of the town, ensure that town residents and visitors can safely navigate through the town to their intended destinations, and promote the continued well-being of the town. It is therefore the purpose of this division to promote aesthetics and the public health, safety and general welfare, and assure the adequate provision of light and air within the town through reasonable, consistent and nondiscriminatory standards for the posting, displaying, erection, use, and maintenance of signs and sign structures that are no more restrictive than necessary to achieve these governmental interests. 
(6)  Specific legislative intent. More specifically, this division is intended to: 
(a)  Encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the town; 
(b)  Maintain and enhance the scenic beauty of the aesthetic environment and the town's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; 
(c)  Ensure pedestrian safety and traffic safety; 
(d)  Minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public places, public rights-of-way and private rights-of-way; 
(e)  Foster the integration of signs with architectural and landscape designs; 
(f)  Lessen the visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation, excessive height, and excessive sign area which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and are not necessary to aid in wayfinding; 
(g)  Allow signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation, while precluding the placement of signs that contribute to sign clutter or that conceal or obstruct adjacent land uses or signs; 
(h)  Encourage and allow signs that are appropriate to the zoning district in which they are located and consistent with the land uses, activities and functions to which they pertain; 
(i)  Curtail the size and number of signs to the minimum reasonably necessary to identify a residential or business location, and the nature of such use, and to allow smooth navigation to these locations; 
(j)  Establish dimensional limits and placement criteria for signs that are legible and proportional to the size of the parcel and structure on which the sign is to be placed, or to which it pertains; 
(k)  Regulate signs so that they are effective in performing the function of identifying and safely directing pedestrian and vehicular traffic to a destination; 
(l)  Preclude signs from conflicting with the principal use of the parcel and adjoining parcels; 
(m)  Regulate signs in a manner so as to not interfere with, obstruct the vision of, or distract motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians; 
(n)  Except to the extent expressly preempted by state, Broward County or federal law, ensure that signs are constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner, and protect the public from unsafe signs; 
(o)  Preserve, conserve, protect, and enhance the aesthetic quality and scenic beauty of all zoning districts of the town; 
(p)  Allow traffic control devices consistent with national standards without regulation in this division, because they promote highway safety and efficiency by providing for the orderly movement of road users on streets and highways, and by notifying road users of regulations and providing nationally consistent warnings and guidance needed for the safe, uniform and efficient operation of all modes of travel, while regulating private signs to ensure that their size, location and other attributes do not impair the effectiveness of such traffic control devices; 
(q)  Protect property values by precluding, to the maximum extent possible, signs that create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other properties as a result of their size, height, illumination, brightness, or movement; 
(r)  Protect property values by ensuring that the size, number and appearance of signs are in harmony with buildings, neighborhoods, structures, and conforming signs in the area; 
(s)  Regulate the appearance and design of signs in a manner that promotes and enhances the beautification of the town and that complements the natural surroundings in recognition of the town's reliance on its natural surroundings and beautification efforts as a source of economic advantage as an attractive place to live and work; 
(t)  Classify and categorize signs by type and zoning district; 
(u)  Not regulate signs more than necessary to accomplish the compelling and important governmental objectives described herein; 
(v)  Enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations; 
(w)  Permit, regulate and encourage the use of signs with a scale, graphic character, and type of lighting compatible with buildings and uses in the area, so as to support and complement the goals, objectives and policies set forth in the Town's Comprehensive Plan; 
(x)  Establish regulations of the design, erection and maintenance of signs for the purpose of ensuring equitable access to graphic communication, while maintaining a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing visual environment within the town, recognizing that signs form an integral part of architectural building and site design and require equal attention in their design, placement and construction. 
(C)  Severability. 
(1)  Generally. If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division is declared unconstitutional by the final and valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, this declaration of unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division. 
(2)  Severability of provisions pertaining to prohibited signs. This paragraph (3) shall not be interpreted to limit the effect of paragraph (1) above, or any other applicable severability provisions in the Code of Ordinances or any adopting ordinance. The town council specifically intends that severability shall be applied to section 12-236 "Prohibited Signs," so that each of the prohibited sign types listed in that section shall continue to be prohibited irrespective of whether another sign prohibition is declared unconstitutional or invalid. 
(3)  Severability of prohibition on off-premises signs. This paragraph (4) shall not be interpreted to limit the effect of paragraph (1) above, or any other applicable severability provisions in the code of ordinances or any adopting ordinance. If any or all of these sign regulations or any other provision of the Town Code is declared unconstitutional or invalid by the final and valid judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction, the town council specifically intends that the declaration shall not affect the prohibition on off-premises signs in section 12-236.

(Ord. No. 2018-004, § 2(Exh. A), 3-21-18) 
Editor's note- The provisions allowing ten (10) new off-premises signs were originally adopted by Ordinance 1996-30 and became effective on June 19, 1996. All ten (10) signs authorized by Ordinance 1996-30 have been constructed. 
Sec. 12-245. - Nonconforming signs. 
(A)  Nonconforming signs other than off-premises signs. 
(1)  In general. Signs, other than off-premises signs, lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this division may be continued for an amortization period not to exceed five (5) years although their size, location or other physical attributes do not conform to this division. 
All such signs lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this division shall be considered legal nonconforming signs during their five-year amortization period. However, all legal nonconforming signs shall be deemed to have exhausted their economic life after said amortization period. The amortization period shall begin at the time of the adoption of this division. Nonconforming signs, after this amortization period, shall either be made to conform to the terms and requirements of this division or shall be removed by the owner, owner's agent or person having beneficial use of the property. Nonconforming signs, during the amortization period, shall be kept in good repair, but the cost of maintenance shall not be considered grounds for their continued use beyond the amortization period. 
(2)  Limitations of nonconforming signs. A nonconforming sign which continues to exist beyond the amortization period set forth in paragraph (1), above shall be governed as follows: 
a.  The sign shall not be structurally altered in any way, other than to create a conforming sign. This shall specifically prohibit the introduction of any new sign components or methods of sign illumination. 
b.  If damaged or destroyed, the sign shall not be reconstructed. 
c.  The sign shall not undergo a change of sign copy, except for lawfully established changeable copy signs. 
(B)  Nonconforming off-premises signs. 
(1)  Although off-premises signs are currently prohibited, a number of off-premise signs were previously constructed lawfully within the town. This subsection provides for the legal status of the lawfully established off-premises signs and regulates the manner in which they may be maintained. 
(2)  Off-premises signs lawfully established pursuant to a building permit prior to January 1, 2010, and which met all Town Code requirements in effect at the time of sign construction shall be considered conforming to this division provided that the sign is not modified other than as related to changes of copy consistent with the original, approved design. For example, and not by way of limitation, an off-premises sign originally designed as a static message sign with external illumination, shall not be modified to allow automatically rotating messages, digital messages or new methods of sign illumination. This paragraph is not intended to prohibit normal repair and maintenance or the replacement of sign lighting and other components consistent with the original, approved sign.

(2)  Result in a desirable residential environment on acre lots in areas with exiting agricultural uses, allowing for lifestyle compatibility recognizing open space as essential to the identity of rural-agricultural areas. 
(3)  Ensure that developments provide for a seamless transition from existing agricultural uses to single-family homes. 
(4)  Encourage public access through communities. 
(5)  Ensure that upgraded landscape buffers and scenic corridors are provided adjacent to major road rights-of-way. 
(6)  Ensure that future growth is in keeping with the goal of the Rural Lifestyle Initiative as adopted by town council on July 3, 2001. 
(7)  Ensure that future development, in areas with large vacant lands, are designed based upon the existing site conditions of the property and the surrounding land uses. 
(8)  Ensure that trails are provided and enhanced as identified on the town's master trail map.

Sec. 12-295. - Open space relationships. 
    Open space relationships. Existing Town of Davie, county, and/or state open space, such as parks and or trails shall be buffered during the site design process. No site plan shall be approved for a parcel governed by the Rural Lifestyle Regulations which does not provide for a buffer consistent with the following criteria: 
(A)  Parks and other protected undeveloped lands shall be buffered by providing a minimum twenty (20) foot landscape buffer along the property line. Such land shall be planted and maintained by the applicant, yet individual fences may not be placed within the buffer. An association may place a uniform green vinyl clad chain-link fence or other design at the discretion of the planning and zoning manager, without delineating individual lots, around the landscape buffer. Such landscape buffer and associated restrictions shall be clearly identified on the approved site plan.

DIVISION 5. - OPEN SPACE DESIGN OVERLAY[10] 

Footnotes: 
--- (10) --- 
Editor's note- At the editor's discretion, Div. 5, §§ 12-290-12-298 were renumbered as §§ 12-298-12-299.7 in order to incorporate Ord. No. 2002-35, adopted 10-16-2002 as Div. 4, §§ 12-288.5-12-297. 

Sec. 12-298. - Intent, applicability, definitions. 
    Intent. It is the intent of these regulations to offer an alternative to traditional subdivisions by way of an Open Space Design Overlay, as approved by town council through the rezoning process, in locations conducive to such a site design process. 
    Specifically, the Open Space Design Overlay is intended to: 
1.  Provide greater innovation and flexibility in the design of residential developments; 
2.  Encourage the permanent preservation of open space, agricultural land, wildlife habitat, or other natural resources including wetlands, and historical and archeological resources in a manner that is consistent with the town's Comprehensive Plan; and 
3.  Encourage a form of development that consumes less open land and conforms to existing natural features better than the thirty-five thousand-square-foot minimum size lot. 
These regulations are intended to preserve the traditional rural character of the town's land use pattern through the creation of large contiguous open areas abutting major road rights-of-way, recreational trails, and parkland or other lands of natural space or preservation areas. 
Applicability. These Open Space Design Overlay regulations shall only be applicable to parcels zoned AG, A-1 or R-1 located within the "eligible areas" shown in the following map or to parcels zoned AG, A-1 or R-1 which are twenty (20) acres or more in size. Upon approval pursuant to these regulations, the subject property shall be developed consistent with these regulations and the ordinance which approved the use of the Open Space Design Overlay. 
In addition, the appropriate location of an Open Space Design Overlay shall be based upon the natural attributes of the land as well as adjacent land uses. The Open Space Design Overlay shall be an appropriate site design technique when adjacent to the following: 
A.  Adjacent to an agricultural or rural corridor as identified in article IX, division 2, entitled Scenic Corridor Overlay District. 
B.  Adjacent to a park and/or Environmental Sensitive Land (ESL) sites. 
C.  Adjacent to an existing or proposed trail system of greater than thirty-five (35) feet in width. 

    Definitions. For purposes of this division: 
    Open space shall mean any land used primarily for resource protection, agriculture where agricultural products are not sold on-site, recreational purposes, or areas otherwise left undisturbed and specifically excluding road rights-of-way, both public and private. Open space also includes land for the preservation of natural areas, landscaping buffers adjacent to road right-of-way exclusively. Structures, tennis courts, recreational structures and non-pervious areas are permitted to be located within open space but shall not exceed fifteen (15) percent of the required open space. Retention and detention ponds shall not be considered open space. This section shall supersede section 12-72, entitled Open space uses and limitations. 
    Contiguous shall be defined as being connected. Open space will still be considered connected if it is separated by a roadway or an accessory amenity. The town council may waive these requirements for all or part of the required open space where it is determined that allowing noncontiguous open space will promote the goals of the ordinance and/or property identified conservation areas. 
(Ord. No. 2002-34, § 1, 10-16-02; Ord. No. 2013-21, § 2(Exh. A), 9-18-13; Ord. No. 2017-015, § 2(Exh. A), 4-19-17) 
Sec. 12-299. - Open space design overlay process. 
(A)  An owner seeking to develop his/her property pursuant to these Open Space Design regulations shall submit an application on a form approved by the town administrator or his/her designee along with a fee as determined by resolution of the town council. 
(B)  Such application shall be evaluated and approved by town council through an Ordinance, based upon the following criteria: 
1.  Whether and to what extent the proposed development contributes towards the creation of a network of open space and promotes accessibility from residential areas to green space; 
2.  Whether and to what extent the proposed development locates the required open space to benefit both the development and the community of Davie. 
3.  Whether and to what extent the proposed development addresses the long-term maintenance of the proposed open space, landscape and nature conservation areas. 
(C)  Regulatory flexibility. To encourage flexibility and creativity consistent with the open space community concept, the town council may grant specific deviations from the requirements of the zoning ordinances for the yard and lot coverage standards as part of the approval process. This shall not include the ability to approve lots less than fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet. Any regulatory modification shall be approved through a finding by the town council that the deviation shall result in a higher quality of development which more satisfactorily achieves the intent and purposes of these regulations than would be possible using the conventional zoning standards. Regulatory modifications are not subject to variance review by the planning and zoning board. All development conditions not contained in the underlying zoning districts shall be included in the ordinance which approves the application. 
(D)  Permitted dwelling types. Detached single family residential dwelling exclusively shall be permitted in the Open Space Design Overlay, through the rezoning overlay approval process. 
(E)  Density. The permitted density of residential uses within an Open Space Design Overlay area shall not exceed the density as designated in the comprehensive plan and as further elaborated within the corresponding zoning districts based upon the development standards in place at the time of application. Such density shall be established utilizing a yield plan as specified below. 
Yield plan. A yield plan shall be presented to town staff, at time of a required pre-application conference to determine the maximum number of permitted dwelling units upon a particular parcel of land. Such plan shall be analyzed by staff based on the underlying zoning districts development regulations, subtracting road rights-of-way, easements, required wetland mitigation, or other natural resource lands from the base site area. In addition, conceptual stormwater retention plans shall also be provided to ensure that any proposed yield plan could be feasibly designed upon the subject site.

(g)  The proposed change will be a deterrent to the improvement or development of other property in accordance with existing regulations; 
(h)  The proposed change will constitute a grant of special privilege to an individual owner as contrasted with the welfare of the general public; 
(i)  There are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accord with existing zoning; 
(j)  The proposed zoning designation is the most appropriate designation to enhance the town's tax base given the site location relative to the pattern of land use designations established on the future land use plan map, appropriate land use planning practice, and comprehensive plan policies directing land use location.

(3)  Approval of rezonings shall be by ordinance and requires a super-majority vote of the council.

    The intent and purpose of this section is to create an organized way to promote the participation of the general public in the text amendment process to the Land Development Code.

1.  Any member of the public may attend a public meeting of the planning and zoning board or town council to comment or suggest text amendments to the Land Development Code. These suggestions shall be provided to the planning and zoning division at a minimum three (3) weeks prior to any meeting in written format. The written format shall include the name of the interested person, the proposed subject matter, and any proposed recommendations. 
2.  In case that the planning and zoning board determines that the suggestion proposed by the member of the public deserves to be considered by town council, the planning and zoning board may make a motion to recommend the suggestion to be reviewed by town council. The suggestions can also be proposed directly to the town council at a public hearing under new business. If town council determines the suggestion is worth being considered as a text amendment for the town Land Development Code, town council may make a motion to instruct the member of the public to meet with planning and zoning staff to initiate such text amendment process. 
3.  In addition, any member of the public may propose a suggestion through the community redevelopment agency, if applicable, or the town administrator and his/her designee. In the event that either find the suggestions worth consideration, either may ask the member of the public to meet with planning and zoning staff and submit an application to initiate the text amendment process. 
    The text amendment process is initiated by presenting a text amendment application along with the proper fee, as amended from time to time, to the planning and zoning division and meeting the following criteria: 
1.  The proposed change is consistent with the goals, policies and objectives of the adopted comprehensive plan. 
2.  The proposed change has the intention to benefit the public interest.

(A)  Planning and Zoning Board Review: 
(1)  The board shall provide a recommendation to the town council in accordance with the following criteria: 
(a)  Whether the right-of-way is needed for public utilities including storm-water drainage and pedestrian easements to be retained or required to be dedicated as requested by the various departments or utility companies. 
(b)  Whether the vacation would cause a substantial detrimental effect upon or substantially impair or deny access to any lot of record. 
(c)  Whether the vacation would adversely impact the existing roadway network, such as creating dead-end rights-of-way, substantially alter utilized travel patterns, or undermine the integrity of historic plats of designated historic landmarks or districts. 
(d)  Whether the right-of-way is needed for the purpose for which the town has a legal interest and, whether there is a present or future need for the right-of-way for public vehicular or pedestrian access, or for public utility corridors. 
(e)  The town council may also consider any other factors affecting the public health, safety, or welfare. 
(2)  An applicant may withdraw an application at any time prior to a vote by the town council. 
(B)  Town Council Review: 
(1)  The town council shall establish a public hearing to consider public testimony and the planning and zoning board recommendation and may deny, deny without prejudice, approve or approve with conditions. Approval shall be by ordinance. Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the town council's review of any vacation or abandonment of right-of-way application is unduly delayed by more than three (3) regularly scheduled meetings by planning and zoning board members, the application shall be transmitted by the development services department to the town council for its deliberation and determination. In the event that members of the planning and zoning board have indicated their inability to vote upon an application due to a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict as indicated with the Florida Statutes and upon the town attorney's determination that these conflicts would effectuate a lack of quorum by the board with regard to any vacation or abandonment of right-of-way application, the application shall be transmitted by the development services department to the town council for its deliberation and determination. 
(2)  Whenever the council has acted upon a vacation or abandonment of rights-of-way for property, whether approved or denied, the planning and zoning board shall not thereafter consider any further application for the same or any other kind of vacations or abandonments of rights-of-way for any part or all of the same property for a period of one (1) year. The above time limits may be waived by a majority vote of the council when the council deems such action necessary to prevent injustice or to facilitate the proper development of the city. 
(C)  Application of Charter: Vacations and abandonments of right-of-way are subject to the applicable provisions of the Town Charter.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2001-049, §§ 1, 2, adopted 12-4-2001, amended division 4, §§ 12-312-12-314 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former division 4, pertained to administrative appeals procedure, and derived from Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90. 

Sec. 12-312. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to set forth the procedure for a vested rights determination. The term "vested rights" encompasses both a claim for vested rights and a claim of equitable estoppel. 
(Ord. No. 2001-049, § 2, 12-4-01) 
Sec. 12-313. - Procedure for vested rights determination. 
(A)  A request for a vested rights determination shall be made by the applicant in a letter to the town attorney, with a copy of the letter simultaneously sent to the town administrator, the development services director, the mayor and each councilmember. 
(B)  Accompanying the copy of the letter to the town administrator shall be a fee as set by resolution to cover the cost to the town for making the vested rights determination. 
(C)  The letter requesting a vested rights determination shall state with specificity each and every reason and each and every fact upon which the applicant is relying in order to support its claim for a vested right, and the specific vested right that the applicant desires. The applicant shall also enclose with the letter, and all copies of the letter, all evidence and proof which it is relying upon to support its claim for vested rights. 
(D)  The town attorney shall review the letter and the evidence and proof submitted. The town attorney shall be entitled to request all additional information that he/she believes is helpful to him/her and/or staff in making the vested right determination. Such additional information requested can include, but is not limited to, the following: questions to the applicant and officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and experts of the applicant, documents from the applicant and officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and experts of the applicant, affidavits from the applicant and officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and experts of the applicant, taking sworn statements from the applicant and officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, and experts of the applicant and in meeting with the applicant or officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents or experts of the applicant. In making the vested rights determination, the applicant or the applicant's officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and experts failure to provide what is requested from the town attorney may be considered negatively toward the applicant's request for a vested rights determination or in a supplemental vested rights determination. 
(E)  The town attorney, once the information has been provided and once he/she is of the opinion that the vested rights determination can be given, shall provide a vested rights determination in writing. The applicant is limited to the information which has been provided. The applicant cannot provide new information without first requesting permission from the town attorney to do so. 
(F)  The written vested rights determination or supplemental vested rights determination of the town attorney shall be either faxed or mailed certified mail to either the applicant, its attorney or its agent. 
(G)  The vested rights determination or supplemental vested rights determination remains final and binding upon the applicant unless the applicant appeals the town attorney's determination within twenty (20) days of the date of the town attorney's determination. In the event that the applicant fails to timely appeal the vested rights determination or, in the event of a supplemental vested rights determination fails to appeal the supplemental vested rights determination, of the town attorney, it is conclusively presumed that the town attorney's determination is final. In the event that the applicant desires to challenge the vested rights determination or supplemental vested rights determination of the town attorney, the applicant must deliver to the town administrator by 4:00 p.m. within twenty (20) days of the date of the town attorney's determination a notice of appeal of the town attorney's determination (if the twentieth (20th) day is on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in which the town administrator's office is closed, then the appeal may be timely delivered on the immediate next day that the town administrator's office is open). The notice of appeal shall be strictly limited to advising of the desire to appeal and the relief that the applicant is requesting. No further statements or argument are permitted in the notice of appeal. 
(H)  The town administrator shall place this appeal on the agenda of a town council meeting on such date that the town administrator considers appropriate. 
(I)  The town council shall consider the appeal at the town council meeting when the appeal is on the agenda, but the town council is permitted to table the appeal to such time as the town council considers appropriate. The town council is also empowered to request that the town attorney obtain additional information from the applicant and officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and experts of the applicant. The town council is also entitled, should it so chose, to obtain input from the public concerning the vested rights determination. The applicant is not entitled to speak during the appeal unless the town council permits the public to speak or unless the town council permits the applicant to speak. In the event that the town council requests or solicits additional information, the matter shall be sent back to the town attorney for a supplemental vested rights determination in light of the additional information requested or given. When that supplemental vested rights determination is provided by the town attorney, he/she shall provide notice as described in subsection (F), and that supplemental vested rights determination shall be described as indicated in subsection (G), and in the event of an appeal of that supplemental vested rights determination it shall be placed on the agenda as described in subsection (H), and shall be treated by the town council as described in subsection (I). 
(J)  When the town council makes its determination on the appeal, the appeal shall be based on the information in the record, which information is the information provided by the applicant, the information provided by staff, the information provided from all other sources which are in the record, and information provided by the town attorney. In making the vested rights determination or supplemental vested rights determination, the applicant or the applicant's officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and experts failure to provide what is requested from the town attorney or the town council may be considered negatively toward the applicant in its request for a determination. The determination of the town council in the appeal is final. 
(K)  The applicant has not exhausted its administrative remedies until such time as it has complied with this procedure.

ARTICLE XI. - PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS AND CONCURRENCY DETERMINATIONS[12] 
Footnotes: 
--- (12) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2016-014, § 2(Exh. A), adopted July 27, 2016, amended the title of Article XI, changing it from Development Review Procedures to Public Improvements and Concurrency Determinations. 

DIVISION 1. - CONSISTENCY AND CONCURRENCY DETERMINATIONS 

Sec. 12-320. - Generally. 
(A)  Purpose: It is the purpose of this section to implement the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulations Act of 1985, which requires that local governments adopt and maintain land development regulations "that are consistent with and implement" the adopted comprehensive plan (Section 163.3202, Florida Statutes). This section will describe requirements and procedures for determination of consistency of proposed development projects with the Town of Davie's Comprehensive Plan, hereinafter referred to as the "Comprehensive Plan," including meeting concurrency requirements of the plan. 
(B)  Intent: It is intended that no land development activity be approved unless it is found that such development activity is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and applicable development regulations; further, that such development activity shall not degrade the level of service (LOS) standards established in the Comprehensive Plan for roads, sanitary sewer, potable water, drainage, solid waste and recreational facilities. This section is designed to ensure that adequate facilities are in place concurrent with the impact of the new development. 
(C)  Determining Consistency with the Davie Comprehensive Plan: If a development proposal is found to meet all the requirements of this chapter, it shall be presumed to be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. The director of development services shall verify the consistency of a development proposal with the Comprehensive Plan prior to issuance of a development permit. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90) 
Sec. 12-321. - Concurrency management. 
(A)  Generally: The following method of ensuring concurrency shall be known as the "System for the Management of Concurrency (SYMCON)." The SYMCON is based upon the Comprehensive Plan and level of service standards adopted herein. The system is designed to ensure that the cumulative effects of proposed development activity will not result in a degradation of the adopted levels of service for specified public facilities and services. The SYMCON also includes a monitoring system for determination of the availability of adequate capacity of public facilities and services to meet the adopted level of service standards. 
    All applications for plat, site plan or building permit approval shall demonstrate that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service in the town. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the prescribed levels of service may be degraded during the actual construction of new facilities, if upon completion of the new facilities the prescribed levels of service will be met. 
(B)  Determination of Available Capacity: For purposes of these regulations, the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by: 
(1)  Calculating the total design capacity of existing and proposed facilities operating at the required level of service and available concurrent with the impact of the proposed development. 
(2)  Subtracting from that number the sum of the capacity demand for the service created by existing or previously approved development and the new capacity demand for the service that will be created concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development. 
A plat, site plan or building permit subject to an adequacy determination shall be approvable only if one or more of the following is shown: 
(i)  The facilities necessary to provide adequate levels of service are in place at the time the impacts of development occur. 
(ii)  Construction of the new facilities necessary to provide adequate levels of service is under way at the time of development approval. 
(iii)  The necessary facilities are the subject of a binding, executed contract for the construction of the facilities, to be constructed within a period of time as stipulated in the contract, or for the provision of services at the time the development permit is issued. 
(iv)  The necessary facilities have been funded in the current fiscal year budget of the town, county or state capital improvement program. 
(v)  The necessary facilities are guaranteed at a specific time in an enforceable development agreement. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pur-suant to Section 163.3220, Florida Statutes, or an agreement or development order pursuant to Chapter 380, Florida Statutes. Such facilities must be consistent with the capital improvements element of the town/county comprehensive plan and approved by the town. 
(vi)  The developer has contributed funds to the town/county necessary to provide the necessary facilities consistent with the Capital Improvements Element of the Town/County Comprehensive Plan. Commitment that the facilities will be built must be evidenced by an appropriate budget amendment and appropriation by the town/county or other applicable governmental entity. 
(C)  Burden of Showing Compliance on Developer: The burden of showing compliance with adopted levels of service standards shall be that of the developer. In order to be approvable, applications for development approval shall provide sufficient and verifiable information showing compliance with these standards. The development services department shall supply concurrency management forms to be completed by the developer. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90) 
Sec. 12-322. - Application of concurrency monitoring system. 
(A)  Development Subject to Adequacy Determination: 
(1)  For plats or replats, or for site plans or building permits where the property is unplatted or was platted, with plat approval received before March 20, 1979, all development of previously vacant land, except that specified in subsection (A)(3) below, shall be subject to adequacy determination unless a current site plan is in effect for the development. 
(2)  For plats or replats, or for site plans or building permits where the property is unplatted or was platted, with plat approval received before March 20, 1979, all development of previously improved lands shall be subject to an adequacy determination for the additional trips that equals the difference between the trips to be generated by the proposed development and the trips to be generated by any existing development. Existing development shall be construed to include previous development demolished no earlier than eighteen (18) months previous to the date the final plat application is submitted, or the application for a site plan or building permit approval is submitted. 
(3)  For a replat, or an amendment to a note on a plat, or a requirement to place a note on a plat, where property was platted after March 20, 1979, an adequacy determination shall be required for only those additional trips that equal the difference between the previous plat and the replat, or the previous note and the proposed amendment to the note, or the development approved by the county commission at the time of plat approval and the proposed note to be placed on the plat. 
(B)  Development Exempt from Adequacy Determination: 
(1)  An application for a building permit within a development with an approved, valid development order issued pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 380, Florida Statutes. 
(2)  Applications for building permits for existing development which do not result in an increase in the number of dwelling units or otherwise increase service demands of the development. 
(3)  With respect to the review for adequacy of the regional transportation system only, a concurrency review shall not be required for construction of one (1) single-family or duplex dwelling on a lot or parcel of record prior to March 1, 1989. 
(4)  Development not subject to an adequacy determination pursuant to paragraph (A) above. 
(5)  Development not subject to an adequacy determination pursuant to the de minimis exception as set forth in this subparagraph: 
(a)  If the proposed development is within a compact deferral area, it shall be deemed a de minimis exception to the adequacy determination requirements if the proposed development meets all of the following criteria: 
1.  For the proposed development on vacant land, the residential density shall not exceed an average of four (4) dwelling units per gross acre and the nonresidential floor area shall not exceed ten (10) percent of the gross land area. 
2.  For the proposed redevelopment of developed property, the number of proposed dwelling units shall not exceed twice the number of existing dwelling units, and the proposed gross floor area for nonresidential use shall not exceed twice the existing floor area. Conversions between residential and nonresidential uses shall not exceed twice the floor area of the original use. 
3.  The traffic generated by the proposed development on the overcapacity link does not exceed one-tenth (0.1) of one (1) percent of the capacity of that link at the adopted level of service. 
4.  The cumulative impact of such exemptions shall not exceed three (3) percent of the capacity of any overcapacity link at its adopted level of service. 
5.  The total traffic generated by the proposed development shall not exceed five hundred (500) trips per day. If this provision is applied more than once on a parcel of land, then the cumulative total traffic generated by all such applications shall not exceed five hundred (500) trips per day, per plat, or per parcel of land for unplatted property which was a parcel of record as of March 20, 1979. 
6.  A notation is placed on the face of the plat, or is recorded against the property via separate document if the application is not for a plat, stating that if a building permit for a principal building is not issued on the subject property within three (3) years of the issuance of the development permit, that the town's finding of adequacy of the regional road network has expired, and that no additional building permits shall be issued unless the Town of Davie makes a new finding that the application satisfies the adequacy requirements of the regional road network. 
7.  If development is approved pursuant to this provision, in order to retain its de minimis exception designation, the use for which such development is approved may only be amended provided such development continues to be consistent with the criteria contained within this subsection. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90; Ord. No. 94-25, § 1, 8-3-94) 
Sec. 12-323. - Adopted levels of services and measurement of capacities. 
    The following level of service standards are excerpts from the comprehensive plan. These standards are provided to implement the level of service standards adopted in the plan.

h.  The development is authorized by an approved development of regional impact (DRI) development order. 
i.  The proposed development is found to have vested rights with regard to any affected roadway segments or infrastructure capacity reservations. 
(3)  Measurements. The procedure for the initial measuring of highway capacities is the Florida DOT "Table of Generalized Daily Level-of-Service Maximum Volumes," made available to local government for use from January, 1989 through December, 1990. Future capacities standards will be issued by FDOT as necessary. The measurement of capacity may also be determined by substantiation in the form of engineering studies or other data. Traffic analysis techniques must be technically sound and justifiable as determined by the Broward County Office of Planning and the town engineer. Alterations to capacity on the state highway network shall require the opportunity for FDOT review. Measurement of county and state roads shall be in accordance with the development review requirements (section 5-182) of the Broward County Land Development Code. Any developments that are determined to be within or create a compact deferral area shall be reviewed in conjunction with Broward County Office of Planning and any other affected agencies to determine if an action plan can resolve the capacity deficiencies.

Sec. 12-325. - Development presumed to have maximum impact permitted. 
    The proposed development shall be presumed to have the maximum impact on necessary services and facilities permitted under the most restrictive of the applicable land development regulations such as zoning regulations, the town land use plan or under applicable deed or plat restrictions. However, if a final site development plan has been approved by the council, then review shall be governed by the scope of development shown in the site development plan and any development order issued shall be conditioned on impact and development consistent with the site development plan filed. If any plat has been reviewed for adequacy of services at a developmental level less than the maximum permitted by applicable regulations, then a notation limiting the development to such lessor impact shall be designated on the face of the recorded plat. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90) 
Sec. 12-326. - Limitations on required dedications; money in lieu of dedications. 
(A)  The council shall determine the reasonable proportion of any property to be developed that shall be required pursuant to this division to be granted, dedicated or reserved to the public. Such determinations shall be based upon a finding of a rational relationship between the required dedication, grant or reservation and the anticipated needs of the community, taking into account the immediate and direct impact of the proposed development and the long-term impact of continued approval of additional developments on necessary services and facilities in the affected geographical area. Any specific dedication requirements set forth in this division shall be a general standard or guideline, and in a proper factual situation may be reduced by the council to comply with this section. 
(B)  The amount of money required to be deposited with the town in lieu of dedication requirements shall be determined pursuant to the specific standards set forth in this section. The use of such funds will be restricted to the acquisition, expansion and development of service facilities for new users, in a manner consistent with the principles set forth in Contractor & Builders Association v. City of Dunedin, 329 So.2d 314 (Fla. 1976), and otherwise consistent with all requirements of the constitutions of the United States and the State of Florida and all applicable laws. 
(1)  Any monies required pursuant to this section shall be deposited with the town prior to the issuance of a development permit, unless otherwise provided in an agreement entered into pursuant to section 12-327 of this article. 
(2)  After an applicant receives final site development plan approval or building permits are issued for the total development covered by a development permit previously received, if the development as reflected in the approved site plan or building permits issued is less intensive than the development that was used to compute required payment of monies pursuant to section 12-325 of this article, then, at the developer's request and upon appropriate proof, the town shall pay a rebate of that portion of the monies previously paid to the town which is proportional to the reduction in intensity. If the developer has dedicated land, then the amount of such rebate shall be that portion of the property appraiser's assessed value of the land at the time it was dedicated or the value of the land shown by better evidence of value presented to the town prior to the dedication which is proportional to the reduction in intensity. In either case, no rebate shall be paid by the town after a period of five (5) years has passed from the date of the issuance of the applicable development order, except that where an impact agreement pursuant to section 12-327 below provides a different period of time in which a rebate may be paid, the payment of rebates shall be governed by the time period specified in the agreement. 
(C)  When an application for a development permit is made by a governmental agency for the construction of a public building, the town may waive, upon a request therefor, dedications of land, payments of money in lieu thereof, or other fees required by this section if the town finds that the proposed building will serve a public purpose and promote the public health, safety and welfare. 
(D)  When an application for a development permit is made for the construction of a public housing project, a federally funded residential development, or a residential housing department in which there is financial involvement or sponsorship by a governmental agency, the town may waive, upon a request therefor, dedications of land, payments of money in lieu thereof, or other fees required by this article if the town finds that the proposed project or development will provide housing for families with a total family income of eighty (80) percent or less of the median income for Broward County according to the current Standard Metropolitan Statistics of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Any such waiver shall be only for that portion of the development that meets the minimum income criteria. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90) 
Sec. 12-327. - Impact fee agreements. 
(A)  In lieu of the dedication of lands or the payment of fees in lieu of dedication as calculated under the specific standards of this article, or if compliance with one or more sections of this article can be ensured only if the nature and scope of the proposed development is identified by means other than that provided in section 12-325 of this article, any applicant may propose to enter into an impact agreement with the town, designed to establish just and equitable fees or their equivalent and standards for service need appropriate to the circumstances of the specific development proposed. Such an agreement may include, but shall not be limited to, provisions which: 
(1)  Modify the presumption of maximum impact set forth in section 12-325 of this article by specifying the nature of the proposed development for purposes of computing service needs generated; provided, that the agreement shall establish enforceable means for ensuring that the nature of the development will be substantially as agreed; 
(2)  Provide a schedule and method for payment of the fees in a manner appropriate to the particular circumstances of the proposed development in lieu of the requirements for depositing fees set forth in section 12-326 of this article, which may include credit against required fees or dedications to the extent that there is an enforceable agreement between the developer and an appropriate governmental agency to either convey, lease or option property at less than value, which agreement meets in whole or in part the service needs generated by the development; provided, that the town receive, in a form acceptable to the council, security ensuring the payment of the fees subsequent to development permit approval, which security may be in the form of a cash bond, surety bond, an irrevocable letter of credit, negotiable certificate of deposit or escrow account, or a lien or mortgage on lands to be covered by the development order. 
(3)  Provide restrictions on the use of the deposited fees that differ from those set forth in section 12-326 of this article; provided, that the parties to the agreement are satisfied that the fees will be used in a manner that benefits residents of the new users in the town. 
(B)  Any agreement proposed by a developer pursuant to this section shall be presented to the council prior to the issuance of a development order. Any such agreement may provide for execution by mortgages, lien holders or contract purchasers in addition to the landowner, and may permit any party to record such agreement in the Official Records of Broward County. The council shall approve such an agreement only if it finds that the agreement will apportion the burden of expenditure for new facilities in a just and equitable manner, consistent with the principles set forth in Contractors & Builders Association v. City of Dunedin, 329 So.2d 314 (Fla. 1976).

(A)  The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
(1)  Provisions of adequate building sites, suitable to the needs of the use contemplated; 
(2)  Zoning requirements as to the lot sizes and dimensions; 
(3)  Need for convenient and safe access, circulation and control of pedestrian and vehicular traffic; 
(4)  Limitations and opportunities of topographic features. 
(B)  Block lengths shall not exceed one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) feet nor be less than five hundred (500) feet, unless found unavoidable by the development review committee. Where deviation from the grid pattern requirement of this provision is requested, alternative designs will be permitted if approved by the development review committee, upon a finding that substantially equivalent protection of the public safety can be achieved without adhering to the rigid pattern requirement. 
(C)  Pedestrian crosswalks, of not less than ten (10) feet in width, may be required in blocks if necessary to provide safe and convenient access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation or other community facilities in accordance with this article. 
(D)  In lands governed by the Rural Lifestyle Regulations, at least twenty-five (25) percent of all street block lengths (linear frontage) shall not exceed 600 feet (less than one-third ( 1/3 ) mile in length), except where a mid-block access/street, pass through or combination thereof, a minimum of ten feet in width, is provided for pedestrian access. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90; Ord. No. 91-33, 9-4-91; Ord. No. 2002-35, § 1, 10-16-02) 
Sec. 12-337. - Lots. 
(A)  The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to topography and to the character of the area. 
(B)  Lot dimensions and areas shall not be less than those specified by the applicable zoning regulations. 
(C)  Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines. 
(D)  The minimum arc frontage for lots abutting the turnaround of a cul-de-sac shall be twenty-five (25) feet for residential uses and sixty (60) feet for uses other than residential. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90; Ord. No. 91-33, 9-4-91) 
Sec. 12-338. - Design criteria for local street by development type. 
    The design of local streets shall comply with the requirements of the provisions and tables below, depending on the type of development proposed. Deviations from the numerical standards of Tables I, II, III and IV may be allowed, but only where approved by the development review committee upon a finding that substantially equivalent protection of the public safety can be achieved by alternative standards; provided, however, that no alternative standard having more than a ten (10) percent deviation from the numerical standard stated below shall be permitted. If a proposed development includes more than one type of use, the highest criteria shall apply. 
(A)  Residential Development: Residential streets shall be adequate to permit neighborhood traffic circulation to flow from the highest element of the hierarchical classification, the expressway, arterial or collector, to the lowest element, the local residential street. Circulation within a residential development shall be adequate when the criteria of the tables below are met and when collectors and local streets are provided which meet the standards below: 
(1)  Design criteria. If all lots in a development are more than thirty-five thousand (35,000) square feet, the development shall conform to the minimum design standards of Table II. All other residential development shall conform to the minimum design standards of Tables I through IV. 
(2)  Residential collector street. The residential collector street serves as the principal circulation facility within the residential neighborhood unit. Its function is to collect traffic from the interior and deliver it to the closest perimeter intraneighborhood transportation between the residential units and the local centers of attraction such as neighborhood shopping centers, schools, and neighborhood parks. 
(a)  Collectors shall penetrate residential development without forming a continuous network, thus discouraging through-traffic. When discontinuity of local collectors is obtained by off-setting the intersections with the arterials or other collector streets, such off-setting shall at minimum comply with the requirements of subsection (A)(3) below. 
(b)  Single-family residential lots smaller than one (1) acre shall have no direct access to four-lane collector streets. If the sides of adjoining residential lots abut the collector street, with the house and driveway facing the local street, the spacing between intersections shall be not less than two hundred fifty (250) feet, and a nonvehicular ingress and egress line shall be provided along the collector street. When the back of residential lots abut a collector street, a nonvehicular ingress and egress line shall be provided along the collector street. Group parking facilities, as for multifamily use, when located along a collector residential street, shall be served by driveways having a minimum spacing of two hundred fifty (250) feet. 
(c)  In lands governed by the Rural Lifestyle Regulations, No more than twenty (20) percent of all new homes within residential development shall be located on culs-de-sac and "dead-end" streets. The town council may waive this requirement upon demonstration by the applicant that adjacent connections to another development or adjacent access points are not available. 
(3)  Local residential street. The primary function of the local street is to provide the access of vehicles to residential development fronting on the street. Local streets shall provide access to residential development and connect local traffic from private driveways to collector streets. Local streets are required when connections of driveways or private streets to the collector would be otherwise closer than two hundred fifty (250) feet. 
(a)  There shall be a minimum distance of two hundred fifty (250) feet between the intersection of any two (2) local streets with a single collector, except that there may be a minimum distance of one hundred twenty-five (125) feet between "T" intersections. 
(b)  Local streets shall be patterned in such a way that continuous traffic from one collector to another collector is not possible. 
(c)  A cul-de-sac, a dead-end street which provides for a turnaround at its end, shall provide a paved ninety-foot diameter turnaround. 
(d)  A loop street, a local street which begins and ends at the same collector, shall be subject to the following requirements. A loop street may be designed with a right-angle corner serving as a cul-de-sac, providing that a recessed circular pavement at such corner allowing greater frontage for irregularly shaped lots is provided. A loop street may begin at a collector and end at a local street; provided, that the system does not exceed the maximum number of trips permitted. 
(B)  Commercial Development: Commercial development shall be designed to satisfy the needs generated by residential development. The size and location of the proposed commercial development shall be appropriate to support the proposed commercial use. 
(1)  Commercial streets. Commercial streets shall be designed to facilitate the efficient and safe movement of vehicles from the trafficways to regional commercial facilities, and from collectors and local residential streets to community and neighborhood commercial development. The design of commercial streets shall comply with the standards of Table IV. 
(2)  Pedestrian access. Neighborhood and community commercial facilities shall have an efficient and direct pedestrianway connection to the residential areas the facilities are intended to serve. The design of local commercial facilities shall allow pedestrian and bike riders direct access from adjacent neighborhood areas, with due consideration to the elimination of points of conflict between pedestrians and vehicles. 
(C)  Industrial Development: Industrial development shall be designed to provide easy and safe access for incoming raw materials and for the personnel operating the industrial facilities. Adequate location and size shall ensure that noise levels, smells and odors, vibration, radiation and other sources of nuisance will not affect residential development. Industrial streets shall comply with the standards of Table IV.

(1)  That the development application is in conformance with the Code and applicable standards, in which case the council shall grant approval of the application; 
(2)  That the development application is not in compliance with the Code and applicable standards, in which case the council shall deny the application; 
(3)  That the development application is not in compliance with the Code and applicable standards, but conditions have been determined by the council to be reasonably necessary to compliance with the Code and applicable standards, in which case the council shall grant approval of the application with the conditions. 
(D)  Deferral of Final Determination: A final determination upon a development application for a development order by the council under this section may be deferred if: 
(1)  The council finds that available information is insufficient on which to base eitherapproval or denial of a particular development application and the council directs or has directed that a specific study commence to provide the council with information sufficient to form the basis on which to approve or deny the application, and the study will be completed within six (6) months from the date of the council's determination under this subsection. Provided, however, as a prerequisite to directing that a specific study commence to provide the council with information sufficient to form the basis on which to approve or deny the development application, the council shall identify the inadequacy of the information available with respect to the application; or 
(2)  The council determines that adequate public services required by the Code or Broward County are not available, but are planned to become available in the future, in which case the council shall defer action until adequate services are available; approve the application subject to the condition that either no building permit or no certificate of occupancy shall be issued until adequate services are available; or approve an application that the developer enter into an impact agreement to construct development of a type that can be adequately served by existing or planned facilities or to provide facilities sufficient to adequately serve the proposed development. 
(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90; Ord. No. 91-33, 9-4-91) 
Sec. 12-347. - Requirements for certificate of occupancy.

(Ord. No. 90-4, § 7, 2-21-90; Ord. No. 91-33, 9-4-91) 
Sec. 12-348. - Wellfield protection. 
    In order to properly protect existing and future water supply wellfields in Davie, the town shall be governed by the "Potable Water Wellfield Protection Ordinance", Broward County Ordinance No. 84-60, Broward County Charter and Chapter 125, Florida Statutes as amended. The provisions of this chapter shall be effective within Davie and shall set prohibitions and restrictions within identified zones of influence surrounding wellfields, thereby protecting public utility potable water supply wells from contamination by hazardous or toxic substances. 
(Ord. No. 91-33, 9-4-91) 
Sec. 12-349. - Review of applications for development of land formerly in Hacienda Village or unincorporated Broward County currently used for recycling, scrap metal processing and automobile wrecking yard. 
    The review of applications for site plans, master plans, and building permits for activities within recycling, scrap metal processing and automobile wrecking yards that were developed as legal conforming uses under the Hacienda Village or Broward County codes shall be limited in area to that part of the applicant's property that is the subject of the application. The proposed development within the area that is the subject of an application shall conform to the town code in effect at the time of the application. 
    Commentary: Landowners with an existing recycling, scrap metal processing, and automobile wrecking yard use developed under the Hacienda Village or Broward County codes were subject to less restrictive use regulations, such as no requirements for open space. As these properties develop and redevelop under the more restrictive use regulations of the Town of Davie Code, such as a twenty (20) percent open space requirement, the properties will be allowed to come into compliance incrementally by requiring only that part of the property being developed or redeveloped to achieve conformity with the town Code, so long as the overall site adheres to the requirements of [section] 12-34(HH)(10). 
(Ord. No. 2007-013, § 9, 6-20-07) 
DIVISION 6. - SCHOOL CONCURRENCY

Exemption for an age restricted community shall only be applicable provided that a recorded Restrictive Covenant prohibiting the residence of school aged children in a manner not inconsistent with federal, state or local law or regulations is provided. 
(c)  A Development of Regional Impact (DRI) with a development order issued before the effective date of Senate Bill 360 (effective date of Senate Bill 360 is July 1, 2005) or an application submitted before May 1, 2005. 
(d)  As may otherwise be exempted by Florida Statutes, including but not limited to, applications within municipalities which meet specific qualifying criteria outlined in the statute and approved by the school board. 
(2)  The following residential applications shall be vested from the requirements of public school concurrency: 
(a)  Any application located within a previously approved comprehensive plan amendment or rezoning which is subject to a mitigation agreement in accordance with the following: 
1.  The mitigation to address the impact of the new students anticipated from the development has been accepted by the school board consistent with School Board Policy 1161, entitled "Growth Management", as may be amended from time to time, and; 
2.  A Declaration of Restrictive Covenant executed and recorded by the Developer, or the development is located within a boundary area that is subject to an executed and recorded tri-party agreement (between the school board, local government and the applicant) consistent with School Board Policy 1161, as may be amended from time to time. 
(b)  Any application which is included within a residential plat or development agreement for which school impacts have been satisfied for the dwelling units included in the proposed application. This includes any unexpired application approved by the town between February 2, 1979, and the effective date of the Public School Facilities Element and other related amendments regarding school concurrency to the Comprehensive Plan. 
(c)  Any residential site plan (or functional equivalent) that has received final approval, and which has not expired, prior to the effective date of public school concurrency. 
(3)  To be exempt or vested from the requirements of public school concurrency, an applicant seeking such a determination shall be required to submit documentation with the application to the town which shall include written evidence sufficient to verify that the subject development meets the exemptions stated herein, and as such, is exempt from the requirements of public school concurrency. The town shall transmit or provide written information to the school board indicating that the units in the application are vested. 
(C)  Level of service standards: The level of service standard (LOS) shall be one hundred (100) percent of gross capacity (with relocatable classrooms) for each Concurrency Service Area (CSA) until the end of the 2018/19 school year; and commencing at the 2019/20 school year, the LOS for each CSA shall be one hundred ten (110) percent of permanent Florida Inventory of School Housing (FISH) capacity. The LOS shall be achieved and maintained within the period covered by the five-year schedule of capital improvements contained in the effective Five-Year Adopted District Educational Facilities Plan (DEFP). 
(D)  Concurrency Service Areas (CSA's): The areas for the implementation of public school concurrency in Broward County shall be known as Concurrency Service Areas (CSA), and such CSA's shall be the approved school boundaries for elementary, middle and high schools as annually adopted by the school board. For the purposes of public school concurrency, such CSA's shall be effective on the first day of the school year and end on the last day before the beginning of the next school year. 
(E)  Student Generation Rates: The Broward County adopted student generation rate(s) contained in Broward County Land Development Code Section 5-182(m)(6) "Student Generation Rates" shall be utilized to determine the potential student impact anticipated from the residential development proposed in submitted applications. 
(F)  Review procedure: 
(1)  Public School Impact Application (PSIA). Any applicant submitting an application with a residential component, that is not exempt or vested, is subject to public school concurrency and shall be required to submit a Public School Impact Application (PSIA) for review by the school district. Evidence of acceptance of the PSIA and payment of the applicable application fee to the school district shall be required prior to acceptance of the application by the town. 
(2)  School Capacity Availability Determination Letter (SCAD). 
(a)  No residential application or amendments thereto, shall be approved by the town, unless the residential development is exempt or vested from the requirements of public school concurrency, or until a School Capacity Availability Determination (SCAD) Letter has been received from the school district confirming that capacity is available, or if capacity is not available, that proportionate share mitigation has been accepted by the school board. The SCAD letter shall be sent to the applicant, the Broward County Development Management Division and the town with jurisdiction over the subject development, no later than forty-five (45) days after acceptance of the completed PSIA by the school district. 
(b)  The school district shall determine the potential student impact from proposed residential development on the applicable CSA by performing the review procedure specified in School Board Policy 1161, as amended. 
(c)  If the school district determines that sufficient capacity is available at the adopted LOS to accommodate students anticipated from the development, the School District shall issue a SCAD Letter indicating that adequate school facilities exist to accommodate the student impact and that the proposed development satisfies public school concurrency requirements. 
(d)  If the SCAD Letter states that the development has not satisfied public school concurrency requirements, the SCAD Letter shall state the basis for such determination, and the applicant shall have thirty (30) days to propose proportionate share mitigation to the school district. 
(e)  If the applicant proposes proportionate share mitigation within the thirty (30) day deadline, upon the subsequent acceptance of the proposed mitigation by the school board, and upon the execution of a legally binding document among the school board, the town (if applicable) and the applicant, an amended SCAD Letter shall state that adequate capacity anticipated from the accepted proportionate share mitigation will be available to accommodate the student impact anticipated from the proposed development and that the proposed development satisfies public school concurrency requirements. The total amount committed for any mitigation option shall not be less than the school impact fees due for the proposed units as calculated based upon the adopted school impact fee schedule provided in Section 5-182(m)(3) of the Broward County Code of Ordinances. The school impact fee for the development shall be considered included in the total proportionate share mitigation amount due or paid. If the proportionate share mitigation is not accepted by the school board, the Amended SCAD Letter shall state the basis upon which the mitigation proposal(s) was rejected and why the development is not in compliance with public school concurrency requirements. 
(f)  An applicant adversely impacted by a SCAD determination may appeal such determination by written request to the school board within the designated thirty (30) day time period. A timely request for an appeal shall stay the requirement for an applicant to propose proportionate share mitigation until the appeal has been resolved. 
(G)  Term of Public School Concurrency: 
(1)  The public school concurrency approval for a residential application shall expire if development does not commence, as outlined in (2) below, within five (5) years following the date of town approval. 
(2)  If a residential application receives town approval, the development and anticipated students shall be considered vested for up to five (5) years from the date of town approval. Vesting of a residential application beyond the five (5) years requires that one of the following conditions are met within the five (5) year period: 1) the issuance of a building permit for a principal building and first inspection approval or 2) substantial completion of project water lines, sewer lines and the rock base for internal roads. If the development is denied, the school board shall deduct students associated with the development from its database.

The application shall be signed by the current owner or owners of the property to be developed and the name, signature, address, and telephone number of the developer's or owner's representative who shall be contacted with regard to processing of the application. All signatures shall be notarized. 
(B)  The Town Administrator or designee shall provide applicants with a checklist of all required plans and other materials as needed to facilitate an efficient, thorough review and to demonstrate compliance with all applicable Town requirements. Within seven (7) business days of a submittal, the Town Administrator or designee shall provide the applicant with a written determination of whether the application is complete or incomplete, along with a list of any missing items. Formal review of the application will not commence until the application is deemed complete. When reviewing an application that is certified by a professional listed in F.S. § 403.0877, the Town may not request additional information from the applicant more than three (3) times, unless the applicant waives the limitation in writing. Before a third request for additional information, the applicant must be offered a meeting to attempt to resolve outstanding issues. If the applicant believes the request for additional information is not authorized by ordinance, rule, statute, or other legal authority, the Town, at the applicant's request, shall proceed to process the application for approval or denial (the foregoing is a requirement of F.S. § 166.033). 
(C)  In the Open Space Design Overlay, the following shall be submitted in addition to the requirements as stated above: 
(1)  Yield plan. A yield plan shall be presented to town staff, at time of a required pre-application conference to determine the maximum number of permitted dwelling units upon a particular parcel of land. Such plan shall be analyzed by staff based on the underlying zoning district's development regulations, subtracting road rights-of-way, easements, required wetland mitigation, or other natural resource lands from the base site area. In addition, conceptual stormwater retention plans shall also be provided to ensure that any proposed yield plan could be feasibly designed upon the subject site. 
(2)  Site context map. This map shall illustrate the parcel in connection to its surrounding neighborhood. Based upon existing data sources and field inspections, it should show various kinds of major natural resource areas or features that cross parcel lines or that are located on adjoining lands. 
(3)  Conservation identification. In addition, applicants are required to demonstrate that the following design process was performed by a certified landscape architect and considered in determining the layout of proposed street, house lots, and open space. 
(a)  Step one: Identifying conservation areas. Identify preservation lands by two (2) steps. First, primary conservation areas (such as wetlands and floodplains) and secondary conservation area (including mature trees stands, prime farmlands, wildlife habitats and cultural features such as historic and archeological sites and scenic views) shall be identified and delineated. Second, the potentially developable area will be identified and delineated. To the maximum extent feasible, the potentially developable area shall consist of land outside identified primary and secondary conservation areas. 
(b)  Step two: Locating house sites. Locate the approximate sites of individual houses within the potentially developable area and include the delineation of private yards and shared amenities, so as to reflect an integrated community, with emphasis on consistency with the town's historic development pattern. The number of houses enjoying the amenities of the development should be maximized. 
(c)  Step three: Aligning the streets and trails. Align streets in order to access the house lots. Additionally, new trails should be laid out to create internal and external connections to existing and/or potential future streets, sidewalks, and trails. 
(d)  Step four: Lot lines. Draw in the lot lines.

Sec. 12-394.1. - Title. 
    This division shall be known as the "Eastside Neighborhood Special Zoning District (ENSZD)." 
(Ord. No. 94-45, § 1, 12-21-94) 
Sec. 12-394.2. - Intent, applicability and boundaries. 
(A)  Intent. This district is intended to guide design for the improvement and redevelopment of properties in the Eastside Neighborhood Area. The standards contained herein intend to: 
(1)  Maintain flexibility while ensuring that each building contributes to the whole; 
(2)  Ensure that buildings are placed on their lots so as to create public spaces between buildings that are walkable, well-proportioned and memorable; 
(3)  Allow streets and other public spaces to be naturally watched over and more secure; 
(4)  Ensure that buildings are placed on their lots so as to create well-defined and usable private spaces behind buildings; 
(5)  Ensure that service areas and parking lots are screened from view where possible; 
(6)  Encourage interaction among neighbors and establish community identity and pride; 
(7)  Maximize affordable housing opportunities and convenience to jobs and commerce. 
(B)  Applicability. The requirements of this division shall be in addition to each and every other requirement of the Town of Davie Land Development Code (Code), and, in the case of conflict, the provisions of this division shall control. 
(C)  Boundaries. The boundaries of the ENSZD shall be delineated on the ENSZD map of this division. 
(Ord. No. 94-45, § 1, 12-21-94) 
Sec. 12-394.3. - Regulating plan. 
    The Regulating Plan graphic for the Eastside Neighborhood provides the overall view of appropriate land uses. Several properties provide more than one (1) permitted use. The Regulating Plan is intended to be a guide to direct necessary uses and building types to fulfill the goal of redevelopment in the Eastside Neighborhood Area. The three (3) types of buildings of this zoning district are front porch houses (Type I), side porch houses (Type II) and civic buildings. Each building type and placement produces a significant impact on the built environment. 
    The Regulating Plan is not intended to restrict or prohibit development on any parcel. Properties which are shown as a new street or civic use on the Regulating Plan may be constructed as either Type I or Type II buildings. Properties which are shown with different boundaries from the Regulating Plan may be developed with the present boundaries. 
(Ord. No. 94-45, § 1, 12-21-94) 
Sec. 12-394.4. - Neighborhood site design standards. 
    The neighborhood site design standards for porch houses Type I and Type II are within Figure 394.4-1. A request to seek relief from standards may be executed through a variation in design per section 12-438.23. 

FIGURE 394.4.1

(Ord. No. 94-45, § 1, 12-21-94) 
Sec. 12-394.6. - Neighborhood architectural standards. 
(A)  Intent. The Architectural Standards work with Eastside Neighborhood Site-Design Standards, Regulating Plan, and Street Standards, to ensure harmony among buildings. A strict style sheet is avoided so that variety and creativity are not stifled. At the same time, however, the Architectural Standards provide a clear and administratively simple way to review proposals for compliance and fit with the desired image for Eastside. The lists of permitted materials come from a study of the buildings found in South Florida, and are chosen for appropriateness to the subtropical environment. 
A basic intention of the Architectural Standards is authenticity. The standards encourage building constructions which are straightforward and functional, and which draw their ornament genuinely from the traditional assembly of real materials. The standards discourage "fake" materials, such as simulated wood, to avoid a tacky image for the neighborhood. Exceptions should be granted using this statement of intent as a basis for decision-making. The Neighborhood Architectural Standards List includes materials, configurations and general requirements. 
Where these Architectural Standards conflict with the Town of Davie Code of Ordinances, these Architectural Standards shall govern for properties within the ENSZD. 
(B)  Reserved. 
(Ord. No. 94-45, § 1, 12-21-94) 
Sec. 12-394.7. - General requirements.

(C)  The following shall be located in the rear yards only: Clotheslines, clothes drying yards, antennas, barbecues, swimming pools and tubs. 
(D)  Materials that attempt to fake the appearance of some other material shall be discouraged. The following are prohibited: 
(1)  Undersized shutters. 
(2)  "Ribbon windows" or horizontal stripes of glass. 
(3)  Reflective and/or bronze-tint glass. 
(4)  Plastic or PVC roof tiles. 
(5)  Backlit awnings. 
(6)  Glossy-finish awnings. 
(7)  Styrofoam cornices. 
(8)  Barbed wire or wire mesh fences. 
(Ord. No. 94-45, § 1, 12-21-94) 
Sec. 12-394.8. - Landscaping. 
    Landscaping of lots shall conform to the Town of Davie Land Development Code, Article VI. Residential lots shall follow the R-5 District standards and community building lots shall follow the CF District standards. 
(Ord. No. 94-45, § 1, 12-21-94) 
Sec. 12-394.9. - Signage and lighting. 
    All signage and lighting within the ENSZD shall conform to the Town of Davie Land Development Code, Article VIII. 
(Ord. No. 94-45, § 1, 12-21-94) 
Sec. 12-394.10. - Street standards. 
(A)  Intent. These street standards establish certain dimensions and details for the streets within Eastside. Each time a street is constructed or reconstructed, these standards shall be the basis for the design and engineering. The intent is to create streets which appropriately serve the needs of pedestrians, cyclists and motorists, rather than motorists alone. The design requirements for a given street depend on its location and function. These standards are devised to: 
(1)  Discourage high-speed car traffic and careless driving, and encourage eye contact between motorists and pedestrians (through parallel parking, correct travel-lane width, and suitable radii at corners); 
(2)  Establish safe crossings for pedestrians at intersections (through suitable radii at corners); 
(3)  Maintain appropriate passage for emergency vehicles and occasional moving vans (through "clear zones" at corners, to allow smaller curb radii but admit larger vehicles when required); 
(4)  Establish safe sidewalks where pedestrians have minimum conflict with moving cars (by regulating curb cuts and by locating parking and trees between sidewalks and travel lanes); 
(5)  Maintain shade and an agreeable appearance (through orderly spacing of full-size canopy trees); 
(6)  Minimize the heat buildup and to limit impervious area (through minimized asphalt areas and through placement of canopy trees); 
(7)  Efficiently provide parking (through parallel spaces on-street) and to control parking habits (through curbed street sections which deter random or disorderly parking). 
(B)  Standards. These referenced standards of this division shall supersede section 12-338 when in conflict. In order to promote pedestrian safety, corner curb radii shall be twenty (20) feet. Travel lanes may be reduced to ten (10) feet each in width (minimum pavement) to establish quicker pedestrian crossings as well as discouraging increased traffic speeds associated with wider roadways. Sidewalks are required to be at least five (5) feet in width unless restricted by right-of-way and street design dimensions which may require a narrower sidewalk which shall not be less than four (4) feet in width. Parallel parking [is] to be encouraged along streets. Minimum width of on-street parking stalls shall be nine (9) feet, which includes adjacent gutter. On-street parking stalls shall be twenty-two (22) feet long. A clear zone radius of twenty-five (25) feet is applicable to streets in the ENSZD. 
(C)  Landscaping. Trees within the public right-of-way shall be spaced evenly twenty (20) to thirty (30) feet apart, except near street intersections where they may be spaced closed together. All plant materials shall conform to the standards for Florida No. 1 or better, as given in "Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants" Part I, 1963 and Part II, State of Florida, Department of Agriculture, Tallahassee, or equal thereto. Grass sod shall be clean and reasonably free of weeds and noxious pests for diseases. Grass areas shall be planted in species normally grown as permanent lawn. Grass areas must be sodded. All new landscaping must incorporate the Xeriscape principles.

Sec. 12-433.5. - Advisory responsibilities of the committee. 
    The committee has the responsibility to: 
A.  Undertake an inventory to include a survey of properties of historical, architectural and cultural local significance. 
B.  Recommend sites of local significance to be designated by ordinance as part of the thematic historical district. 
C.  Review and make recommendations, guided by the standards below, to landowners proposing new construction, structural additions, alterations, demolition, reconstruction, restoration within the thematic historical district. 
1.  Standards for preservation. 
a.  A property should be used as it was historically, or be given a new use that maximizes the retention of distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships. Where a treatment and use have not been identified, a property should be protected and, if necessary, stabilized until additional work may be undertaken. 
b.  The historic character of a property should be retained and preserved. The replacement of intact or repairable historic materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property should be avoided. 
c.  Each property should be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Work needed to stabilize, consolidate, and conserve existing historic materials and features should be physically and visually compatible, identifiable upon close inspection, and properly documented for future research. 
d.  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right should be retained and preserved. 
e.  Distinctive material, features, finishes, and construction techniques or example of craftsmanship that characterize a property should be preserved. 
f.  The existing condition of historic features should be evaluated to determine the appropriate level of intervention needed. Where the severity of deterioration requires repair or limited replacement of distinctive feature, the new material should match the old in composition, design, color, and texture. 
g.  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, should be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials should not be used. 
h.  Archeological resources shall be protected and preserved from unauthorized access, excavation and disruption. If such resources must be disturbed and that such preservation and protection is not otherwise required by law, the developer shall consult with the Broward County Archaeologist to determine appropriate mitigation. 
2.  Standards for rehabilitation. 
a.  A property should be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships. 
b.  The historic character of a property should be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials of alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property should be avoided. 
c.  Each property should be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, should not be undertaken. 
d.  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right should be retained and preserved. 
e.  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property should be preserved. 
f.  Deteriorated historic features should be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature should match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features should be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. 
g.  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, should be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials should not be used. 
h.  Archeological resources shall be protected and preserved from unauthorized access, excavation and disruption. If such resources must be disturbed and that such preservation and protection is not otherwise required by law, the developer shall consult with the Broward County Archaeologist to determine appropriate mitigation. 
i.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction should not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work should be differentiated from the old and should be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. 
j.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction should be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
3.  Standards for restoration. 
a.  A property should be used as it was historically or be given a new use which reflects the properties restoration period. 
b.  Materials and features from the restoration period should be retained and preserved. The removal of materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize the period should not be undertaken. 
c.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Work needed to stabilize, consolidate and conserve materials and features from the restoration period shall be physically and visually compatible, identifiable upon close inspection, and properly documented for future research. 
d.  Materials, features, spaces, and finished that characterize other historical periods should be documented prior to their alteration or removal. 
e.  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize the restoration period should be preserved. 
f.  Deteriorated features from the restoration period should be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature should match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials. 
g.  Replacement of missing features from the restoration period should be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. A false sense of history should not be created by adding conjectural features from other properties, or by combing features that never existed together historically. 
h.  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, should be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials should not be used. 
i.  Archeological resources shall be protected and preserved from unauthorized access, excavation and disruption. If such resources must be disturbed and that such preservation and protection is not otherwise required by law, the developer shall consult with the Broward County Archaeologist to determine appropriated mitigation. 
j.  Designs that were never executed historically should not be constructed. 
4.  Standards for reconstruction. 
a.  Reconstruction should be used to depict non-surviving portions of a property when documentary and physical evidence is available to permit accurate reconstruction with minimal conjecture, and such reconstruction is essential to the public understanding of the property. 
b.  Reconstruction of a landscaped, building, structure, or object in its historic location should be preceded by a thorough archeological investigation to identify and evaluate those features and artifacts which are essential to an accurate reconstruction. If such resources must be disturbed and that such preservation and protection is not otherwise required by law, the developer shall consult with the Broward County Archaeologist to determine appropriate mitigation. 
c.  Reconstruction should include measures to preserve any remaining historic materials, features, and spatial relationships. 
d.  Reconstruction should be based on accurate duplication of historic features and elements substantiated by documentary or physical evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different features from other historic properties. A reconstructed property should re-create the appearance of the non-surviving historic property in materials, design, color, and texture. 
e.  A reconstruction should be clearly identified as a contemporary re-creation. 
f.  Designs that were never executed historically should not be constructed. 
D.  Recommendations of the committee shall be made prior to issuance of any permit by the town for any structure within the thematic historic district.

--- (18) --- 
Editor's note- See editor's note following Art. XIII, Div. 7. 

Sec. 12-436. - Griffin Corridor District. 
    This division shall be known as the "Griffin Corridor District." 
(Ord. No. 2000-7, § 1, 2-2-00; Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.300), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-436.1. - Intent, applicability and boundaries. 
(A)  Intent. This district is intended to shape urban form and land use along the Griffin Road corridor. The regulations and intent statements contained herein together comprise a policy blueprint for corridor development. Specifically, the district is intended to accomplish the following: 
(1)  Result in improved living and working environments relative to typical highway commercial development patterns. 
(2)  Enhance the town's tax base by increasing property values through high-quality development, and assisting in the redevelopment of downtown. 
(3)  Promote planned developments rather than haphazard speculative development that compromises the integrity of the corridor and the economic health of the town. 
(4)  Promote land uses which attract people for specific purposes such as employment, entertainment, business needs, and shopping, as distinguished from land uses which depend largely upon pass-by traffic for business. 
(5)  Create a showcase corridor which serves as the prominent east-west thoroughfare providing a linkage between the State Road 7, Florida Turnpike, Davie Road, and University Drive corridors; the major north-south urban thoroughfares within the town. 
(6)  Protect the integrity of adjacent residential neighborhoods. 
(7)  Permit a mix of residential and nonresidential development, including mixed uses within buildings or parcels. 
(8)  Compliment rather than compete with downtown or University Drive commercial corridor development. 
(9)  Encourage visual interest by ensuring the building and visual landscapes are accented rather than their parking facilities. 
(10)  Bring buildings to the roadway and ensure proper proportioning to "enclose" the corridor, and provide a sense of place. 
(11)  Provide for preservation of historical structures. 
(12)  Provide for public amenities and pedestrian conveniences. 
(13)  Maintain flexibility so as not to restrict creativity in development and design, while producing development that adheres to the intent of the District, contributing positively to the image of the town. 
(Ord. No. 2000-7, § 1, 2-2-00; Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.301), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-436.2. - Master plans. 
    Intent. The master plan requirement is promulgated to place emphasis on future urban form and to provide the proper coordination of all pertinent common elements related to development activity within a given site along the corridor. 
    It is not the intent of this section to require that the entirety of a large tract be master planned with great detail in order to permit development on a portion of said tract, in cases where there is no forthcoming development on the remainder of the tract, and future development conditions are unknown. However, access, circulation and infrastructure for the tract must be master planned, in addition to the detailed planning of the portion of the tract proposed for immediate development. Portions of the tract may be left "reserved" with respect to specific development details required of master plans, provided the master plan must be amended when such information is available. 
(A)  When required: 
(1)  Parcels capable of being subdivided into two (2) or more conforming lots pursuant to section 12-436.6(A) shall not be divided unless a master plan coordinating development of the parcels has been approved by the town council pursuant to the requirements of this section. Development of a portion of the parcel will not be permitted until a master plan is approved for the entirety of the parcel. 
(2)  Contiguous parcels under common ownership or control as of the effective date of this chapter shall not be individually developed, sold, placed under separate control or further divided unless a master plan coordinating development of the parcels has been approved by the town council pursuant to the requirements of this section. 
(B)  Development of parcels which have been subdivided, sold or placed under separate control in violation of paragraphs (1) or (2) above, shall not be permitted unless such parcel is master planned, under unified control, together with the former "parent" parcel or contiguous parcels formerly under the same control or ownership. 
(C)  Unified control. All master plans must be owned or under the control of the applicant, whether that applicant be an individual, partnership or corporation, or a group of individuals, partnerships or corporations. The applicant shall present firm evidence of unified control of the entire area within the proposed master plan and shall state agreement that, if he proceeds with the proposed development, he or she will: 
(1)  Do so in accordance with the officially approved conceptual master plan of the development, and such other conditions or modifications as may be attached to the development. 
(2)  Provide agreements, covenants, contracts, deed restrictions or sureties acceptable to the council for completion of the undertaking in accordance with the adopted conceptual master plan as well as the continuing operation and maintenance of such areas, functions and facilities as are not to be provided, operated or maintained at general public expense. 
(3)  Bind his development successors in title to any commitments made under items (1) and (2) preceding. 
(D)  Master plans shall include the following information, at a scale no smaller than one (1) inch equals fifty (50) feet, and shall provide dimensions where appropriate: 
(1)  Boundary survey. 
(2)  Proposed parcel divisions within the master plan. 
(3)  Access locations to adjacent roadways and parcels within the master plan, and points of access to neighboring parcels in order that cross-access be provided. 
(4)  Internal circulation. 
(5)  Proposed building locations, maximum heights, floor area and uses, and setbacks. 
(6)  Common open space and landscaped areas with tabulations. 
(7)  Parking facilities with tabulations. 
(8)  Identification of loading areas and proposed screening. 
(9)  Location of pedestrian plazas and pathways, and other public amenities. 
(10)  Reserve areas within the plan not showing the required details listed above in (5) through (9), to be added to the master plan when proposed development conditions are known. 
(11)  Graphically identify the following features within five hundred (500) feet east and west of the master plan site, and two hundred fifty (250) feet south the site, except that proposed master plans shall identify these features within five hundred (500) feet south of the site when having frontage on Davie Road: 
(a)  Parcel boundaries; 
(b)  Existing uses; 
(c)  Accessways and drives; 
(d)  Building locations; 
(e)  Building height; 
(f)  Location of parking facilities; 
(g)  Perimeter landscape buffers; 
(h)  Other physical elements which, like those listed above, would aid in the review of the proposed master plan by providing information on conditions adjacent to the master plan site. 
(E)  Required documentation. Master plan submittals shall be accompanied by documents demonstrating unified control, providing for maintenance and control of common areas, granting easements deemed critical for site circulation, recreational trails or other purpose, and dedicating land for public amenities. Restrictive covenants and agreements for construction of public amenities or circulation elements may also be required. 
(F)  Phasing. Where a master plan will be developed in phases or incrementally, the town council may require construction of all or part of common circulation and/or public amenity elements of a master plan prior to issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy for the first structure to be built, as appropriate, or may require bonding or other security to ensure same. 
(G)  Procedures for review. All master plan submittals shall be preceded by a preapplication conference with Planning and Zoning division staff. Master plans and master plan modifications shall be reviewed and approved pursuant to the site plan review process and site plan modification process, respectively, as set forth in sections 12-371 and 12-374, and shall be subject to the public notification requirements of section 12-306(E) and (F). Easements and dedications associated with a master plan shall be accepted by ordinance. Plat approval may occur simultaneously with master plan approval. Variance applications related to master plans should be considered by the town council prior to Site Plan Committee review of the master plan, however, the preliminary master plan shall be submitted as an exhibit to the variance application to enable the town council to determine the appropriateness and impact of the requested variance(s). 
(H)  The town council may deny a master plan or site plan, or impose conditions, including the imposition of requirements which are stricter than those set forth herein, if such additional restrictions are consistent with the stated intent of these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2000-7, § 1, 2-2-00; Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.302), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-436.3. - Use zones. 
    Use of land within the Griffin Corridor District is governed by four (4) use zones as follows, each of which are delineated on the Official Zoning Map. Permitted uses and associated standards for development vary between use zones, each reflecting unique locational and parcel conditions within the Griffin Corridor District. Following the title of each use zone, below, is the abbreviation for the zone used within tables delineating permitted uses and development standards. 
(A)  West Gateway (Use Zone 1). This zone extends from University Drive east to the Downtown Zone, described below. Office and related complementary uses permitted within the Commercial land use plan designation are encouraged within this zone. Some uses require Commerce/Office plan designation. 
(B)  Downtown (Use Zone 2). This zone generally extends from the eastern boundary of the West Gateway Zone at the Old Davie School east to SW 61 Avenue. Entertainment, dining and tourist-oriented retail uses are encouraged here, with offices and residential uses encouraged on upper floors. Increased building intensity is encouraged, reflecting the gateway to Downtown Davie and the hub of the Griffin Road corridor. Development and uses within this zone reflect a pedestrian orientation. 
(C)  East Gateway (Use Zone 3). This zone extends eastward from SW 61 Avenue to just east of SW 54 Terrace. Retail, office and complimentary uses are encouraged here, although at a lesser intensity than within the Downtown Use Zone. 
(D)  Griffin Commerce (Use Zone 4). This zone extends eastward from the Florida Turnpike to State Road 7. Medium-density residential uses are predominant within this use zone. Should redevelopment occur, Commerce Park type uses, developed in a campus setting with significant open space, are encouraged here. Such uses require a Commerce/Office or Industrial land use plan designation. Development within this area is not subject to the architectural requirements of the Griffin Corridor District. 
(E)  Intersection Commercial Nodes ("Nodes"). Within certain use zones, nodes permit concentrations of highway commercial type uses that cater to, and depend upon, large vehicular traffic volumes, which are not permitted outside of such nodes. The nodes are delineated on the Official Town of Davie Zoning Map. 
(1)  University Drive Node: Located between University Drive and SW 76 Avenue within the West Gateway Zone. 
(2)  Florida Turnpike Node: Located east of SW 54 Terrace and west of the Florida Turnpike within the East Gateway Zone. 
(3)  State Road 7 Node: Located at the State Road 7/Griffin Road intersection within the Griffin Commerce Zone, this node is irregularly shaped, accommodating an existing shopping center at the southwest corner of the intersection, and a small commercial parcel at the northwest corner. 
(Ord. No. 2000-7, § 1, 2-2-00; Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.303), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-436.4. - Permitted uses. 
    The following table identifies the permitted, restricted and prohibited uses within the Griffin Corridor District. This district covers a large area regulated by several underlying land use plan designations. Each land use plan designation allows a different range of uses. Therefore, a given use may not be permitted on every parcel of land within a use zone. A "permitted use" herein is permitted only if consistent with the land use plan designation of a given property. Therefore, before it can be determined that a particular use or combination of uses are permitted on a given parcel of land, the comprehensive plan must be consulted in order to determine whether the use is consistent with the plan. 
    Uses are classified below as Permitted (P), Restricted (R) or Prohibited (N). Restricted uses are followed by a numeral which corresponds to a footnote below the following table. Each footnote explains restrictions associated with the use. The town administrator or designee shall have the discretion to permit uses which are not specifically listed but are similar to uses that are expressly permitted, provided such uses are not expressly identified as permitted, conditionally permitted or prohibited or in another zoning district.

(a)  A shared parking agreement is developed between property owners and the agreement is submitted to the development services for review prior to recording the in the public records of Broward County; and 
(b)  A copy of the recorded shared parking agreement is transmitted to the P&Z manager prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(2)  When any land or building is used for two (2) or more uses, the minimum total number of required parking spaces shall be determined by the following procedures: 
(a)  Multiply the minimum required parking for each individual use, excluding spaces reserved for use by specified individuals or classes of individuals, by the appropriate percentage listed in the appropriate table for each of the designated time periods. Add the resulting sum for each of the five (5) vertical columns of the table. The minimum parking requirement is the highest sum resulting from the foregoing calculation. 
(b)  The maximum reduction under this provision shall be twenty-five (25) percent, unless a greater reduction is approved as a technical deviation.

(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.500), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-438.1. - Introduction. 
    In 1998 the Town of Davie enacted a Regional Activity Center land use category for the east side of the Town of Davie, generally bordered by University Drive, I-595, Florida's Turnpike, and the C-11 Canal adjacent to Griffin Road. The total area designated Regional Activity Center on the land use plan map exceeds two thousand two hundred (2,200) acres, of which more than seven hundred fifty (750) acres are part of the South Florida Education Center (SFEC). The SFEC is a collection of educational institutions located in proximity to one another, and sometimes sharing campus space. The purpose of creating the Regional Activity Center land use plan designation was to enable the town to comprehensively plan for the area as one (1) mixed-use unit, thereby coordinating land use with transit opportunities, and capitalizing on the potential of the SFEC to grow, creating spin-off research and product development, as well as housing opportunities in areas designated for redevelopment, both of which would contribute to the economic feasibility of redeveloping Downtown Davie. 
    Several years later, the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), working with the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) began planning the preliminary design for east-west rapid transit along the Interstate 595 corridor. The SFEC was seen as a major contributor to potential ridership. The Town of Davie subsequently contracted with a multi-disciplinary team to complete a year-long master plan study of the entire Regional Activity Center. The master plan targets urban-scale redevelopment of community and regional significance that is keyed to a long-term mass transit strategy of developing transit corridors, peripheral parking facilities and greenways that are coordinated with a proposed Central Broward east-west transit station location at the northern terminus of College Avenue. 
    The master plan, adopted in 2006 by the town, serves as a blueprint for creating an eastern mixed-use village premised upon the unique collaborative opportunities for redevelopment and economic development related to the SFEC as a resource, and transit and other modes of mobility as the other vital component that would facilitate the area known as the Regional Activity Center in fulfilling its land use designation as a "redevelopment of regional significance." 
    These land development regulations and design standards are intended to implement the adopted master plan. The entire report on these phases of work can be found on record with the Town of Davie. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.501), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-438.2. - Terminology and abbreviations. 
    Definitions of terms unique to the "RAC" Regional Activity Center zoning districts are defined in section 12-438.27. A few key terms and abbreviations necessary for understanding the totality of the RAC Districts regulations are defined in this section.

(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.502), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-438.3. - Intent/purpose. 
    The intent of the RAC districts is to provide for the redevelopment of a multi-modal, pedestrian-friendly, and thoroughly interconnected mixed-use village that encourages significant regional redevelopment. The districts have an opportunity to integrate the unique educational culture of the SFEC to create an unparalleled location to live, work, and play. The RAC districts promote the development of a pedestrian and transit-oriented, mixed-use community through the vertical mixing of uses, transit-supportive intensities, and the shaping of urban form. 
    In order to account for the large scale and varying conditions of the RAC districts, it is imperative that priorities and flexibility be built into regulating the redevelopment of the area. Understanding the intent for each district is important as redevelopment occurs. Therefore the principles that implement the intent for each district are listed for review. Flexibility has been built into the regulations in the form of the design adjustment process (see section 12-438.23). The principles listed throughout these regulations serve as performance criteria used to evaluate site plans, permits and requests for design adjustment. 
    It is the intent of these regulations to encourage (re)development by providing certainty and predictability in the development review process through clear and certain direction as to the desired development outcome. 
    It is also the intent of these regulations to encourage (re)development consistent with certain objectives of these regulations as outlined in section 12-438.9(F) by substantially expediting the standard site plan review process and by providing intensity and/or financial incentives; by replacing the variance (hardship) process with a design-oriented variation process that offers more flexibility and predictability; and, by requiring fewer off-street parking spaces and providing for flexible parking location. 
    The adopted RAC Master Plan established several objectives that the RAC district regulations are intended to implement, as follows. It is important that these regulations be evaluated periodically to ensure that all necessary steps are being taken to implement the RAC Master Plan. 
    Transit-Oriented Development 
(A)  A park-once philosophy; shared private/public structured (or interim surface) parking is encouraged at strategic locations with connecting shuttle service. 
(B)  Achieve a reduction in roadway congestion through the above-referenced peripheral shared parking opportunities, as well as convenient and enticing pedestrian ways, and convenient transit service. 
(C)  Establish on-street parking throughout the RAC districts in order that a larger proportion of private property can be developed through reduced reliance on off-street parking; and to enhance the walkability of streets by slowing the speed of traffic and buffering sidewalks from vehicular traffic. 
(D)  Establish a core area of regional transit-supportive uses and intensity. Transit-Oriented Development shall be a key component. 
(E)  Strongly encourage buildout to the highest permissible density and intensity within one-half (1/2) mile of the proposed east-west regional transit station at the College Avenue and SR 84 intersection. 
    Open Space and Connectivity 
(F)  Encourage the provision of area-wide water retention via curvilinear canals and water bodies with adjacent pedestrian ways to transform surface drainage features into greenways. Where area-wide drainage infrastructure is not available, encourage the use of underground stormwater vaults for retention. 
(G)  Gradually create a systematic and interconnected open/public space component that serves the functions of greenspace relief from an urban environment, recreation and a conduit for pedestrian and bicycle travel. 
(H)  Achieve a street network that offers alternative routes via parallel streets. 
(I)  Encourage a variety of pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular routes that provide appropriate connections to surrounding roadways. 
(J)  Provide pedestrian and bicycle amenities to encourage these modes of mobility. 
    Establish Regionally Significant Uses with Links to SFEC 
(K)  Provide flexibility in the permitted uses of land while not precluding re-use for the primary intended uses, nor precluding infill of urban intensity. Examples include allowing several uses within a building that is designed to ultimately house a research and product development use, or future ground floor retail that may not be supported by current market conditions. 
(L)  Whenever a site is developed at a relatively low intensity relative to the maximum permitted intensity, the site and improvements thereon should be designed and constructed to enable buildout of the site at the maximum allowable intensity at some future time without the need for substantial demolition. Known as "beginning with the end in mind," this approach may, for example, involve designing and constructing buildings to accommodate vertical expansion and designing surface parking lots to eventually accommodate a parking structure. 
    Housing and Residential Density 
(M)  Allow and encourage a variety of housing types and price points through varying maximum densities, creative dwelling configurations, mixing of uses, incentives, and accessory dwellings. 
(N)  To the extent that comprehensive plan density and RAC future land use plan category provisions permit, the number of dwelling units that can be constructed on a lot shall be governed by building and site design, and not a maximum density calculation. 
    Urban Form 
(O)  Encourage visual interest by ensuring the building and visual landscapes are accented rather than their parking facilities. 
(P)  Bring buildings to the roadway, ensure proper proportioning and require continuous building facades to "enclose" designated streets in order to help create a lively and visually appealing environment that invites people to live, locate businesses, and spend time shopping, dining and interacting with others. 
(Q)  Require the location of on-site parking facilities in the rear yard, accessed when possible through rear alleys or side streets. 
(R)  Provide for public amenities and pedestrian conveniences. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.503), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-438.4. - Applicability. 
(A)  The regulations and intent statements contained herein together comprise a policy blueprint for development. 
(B)  The RAC districts together encompass all land designated RAC on the future land use plan map, except for the following areas: land zoned "RAC-AV" Academical Village (See Division 10); land south of the RAC-AV situated between University Drive and SW 76 th Avenue; land south of the C-11 Canal; the Eastside Neighborhood Special Zoning District; and, the Lauderdale Little Ranches and Lauderdale Little Ranches 1st Addition subdivisions recorded in Plat Book 21, Pages 23 and 28 respectively of the Broward County Public Records, and located adjacent to, and east of, the Florida Turnpike, and north of Orange Drive. 
(C)  In case of conflict with any other regulation of Chapter 12, "Land Development Code," this division shall take precedence. The RAC district regulations shall specifically prevail over any other regulations of Chapter 12 pertaining to uses, site development and intensity standards, building size or scale, district performance standards, dimensions, area, separation, coverage, yards, open space, and frontage. 
(D)  In the case of conflict with any court-ordered settlement agreement or F.S. Ch. 1013 campus master plan adopted prior to the adoption of these regulations, the settlement agreement or campus master plan shall prevail to the extent provided therein or by applicable law. It is anticipated, however, that campus master plans will be amended consistent with these regulations, to the extent possible, no later than the next required update. 
(E)  Uses of land which were originally established within the M-3 (Hacienda Village) zoning district prior to February 6, 2008, shall not be considered in conflict with these RAC regulations (division 11) and may continue to operate and expand pursuant to the M-3 (Hacienda Village) zoning requirements until February 6, 2038. This paragraph is not intended to prohibit any landowner from voluntarily complying with the RAC regulations at any time. 
(F)  All RAC districts are subject to provisions of the future land use element of the comprehensive plan, which establishes a maximum number of dwelling units and nonresidential area that can be constructed within a district. Therefore, while any given property within a RAC district can be developed to an intensity specified in these regulations in the form of impervious area, stories and height, the ability of development on any given parcel to reach its maximum allowable intensity hereunder is subject to the availability of dwelling units and/or nonresidential floor area within the Regional Activity Center land use plan designation, as specified in the future land use element. However, each conforming property is entitled to the level of development authorized by the town's zoning and land development regulations prior to the establishment of the RAC districts. Additional development allowance shall be allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis. 
(G)  All new development and redevelopment within the RAC districts shall be consistent with the principles, intent and requirements of these regulations, except as provided in section 12-438.16, "Nonconformities." 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.504), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-438.5. - Transit-oriented streets. 
(A)  Principles. 
(1)  Transit-Oriented streets are mixed-use arterial or collector thoroughfares, with designated transit lanes in most cases, wide sidewalks, and buildings placed close to the street and built to the side lot lines in order to provide a sense of enclosure to the street corridor. 
(2)  Transit-oriented streets are primarily located within a five (5) minute walk from existing or planned regional transit stops, the South Florida Education Center or downtown Davie. 
(3)  Transit-Oriented Development is encouraged along these streets in order that a sufficient mix and intensity of uses exists to support transit use and minimize the need for private automobile travel for those working, shopping, getting an education, and/or living on or near such a street. 
(4)  Retail, restaurant, and entertainment uses are encouraged on the ground floor, but are not required. Residential development on upper floors is encouraged. 
(5)  The mix of these uses is needed to ignite a vibrant street experience and offer a mix in shopping destinations. 
(6)  Buildings along Transit-Oriented Streets should be architecturally interesting. 
(7)  Transit-Oriented Streets should be framed by urban blocks. The characteristics of urban blocks are identified in section 12-438.8, "Components of Place; Streets and Blocks." 
(8)  The intersection of SW 30th Street and University Drive is located directly on the trunk line transit network, and should be considered an Urban Transit-Oriented Node. Additional planning and urban design should occur for this area to ensure an efficient location of the transit stop, park and ride facilities, center of activity, residential areas, secondary areas, and new connectors and local streets where necessary. 
(9)  The following intersections are located on a local feeder bus line within ten (10) minutes travel time from a trunk transit line. Additional planning and urban design should occur for the area around these intersections to ensure an efficient location of the transit stop, park and ride facilities where applicable, center of activity, residential areas, secondary areas, and new connectors and local streets where necessary.

(1)  The following are Transit-Oriented streets: 
  Davie Road, from Orange Drive to Oakes Road (future) 
  Davie Road, from SW 30th Street to SR 84 
  College Avenue south of Nova Drive 
  Nova Drive 
  SW 30th Street 
  Orange Drive 
(2)  Transit-Oriented Streets are treated differently than other streets in that building frontage on such streets shall be structurally designed to accommodate first-story nonresidential use through a minimum floor-to-ceiling ground floor height, and must contain at least two (2) stories. Additionally, buildings that will have at least fifty (50) percent of their street frontage situated within four hundred (400) feet of the center of the intersection of any two (2) Transit-Oriented Streets are required to have a minimum of two (2) use types as classified on Table 12-438.7(C) (ex: retail and office, retail and residential, etc.). Ground floor street frontage on all Transit-Oriented Streets shall consist of retail-conducive storefronts incorporating features such as frequent entries, attractive signage, and display windows to enhance the pedestrian experience. 
(3)  Table 12-438.7(C), "Table of Permitted Uses", Table 12-438.9(E), "Intensity of Use Standards", and Table 12-438.10(C), "Site Development Standards" regulate developments fronting Transit Oriented Streets separately from development within the same zoning district but not fronting a Transit-Oriented Street. For example, a property fronting Nova Drive, a Transit-Oriented Street, is regulated in the listed tables under the column "Transit-Oriented Street" and not under the columns "RAC-ED" or RAC-RTW districts. 
(A)  Where a Transit-Oriented Street regulation pertains to a building (ex: use, height, and all site development standards within Table 12-438.10(C), or a lot (ex: use, impervious area and open space), such regulation shall control over the corresponding zoning district regulations for the entirety of the building and lot with frontage on the Transit-Oriented Street, except as provided in (B), below. 
(B)  It is the intent of these regulations that lots fronting Transit-Oriented Streets be part of urban blocks as characterized in section 12-438.8, "Components of Place; Streets and Blocks." However, this urban block requirement as it applies to lot and block depth is not mandatory in the RAC-ED, RAC-RTW and RAC-RTE districts, which contain some large parcels in excess of one hundred (100) acres, and which may or may not be subdivided into numerous smaller frontage blocks and lots. To the extent that the Transit-Oriented Street frontage of very large parcels is not divided into blocks consistent with the dimensions in section 12-438.8 (for example, a 50-acre campus-type development with only one (1) access road onto a Transit-Oriented Street), the regulations applicable to development fronting Transit-Oriented Streets shall be applied to each entire block fronting a Transit-Oriented Street or the first six hundred (600) feet of lot depth (a basic block depth dimension) measured inward from the street line of the Transit-Oriented Street, whichever distance is less. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2010-021, § 2, 9-7-10; Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.505), 12-5-12; Ord. No. 2014-23, § 2(Exh. A), 12-2-14) 
Sec. 12-438.6. - RAC districts; intent and requirements. 
    The intended form and character for each of the six (6) RAC zoning districts is described in this section through narratives, illustrations, and images. Principles vs. requirements for the developer to adhere to are clearly identified. 
(A)  Davie Regional Research and High Tech District West District (RAC-RTW). 
(1)  General Boundaries. North: SR 84; south: Nova Drive from Davie Road to College Avenue, and approximately three hundred (300) feet south of Nova Drive west of College Avenue; east: Davie Road; west: SW 71 st Terrace. 
(2)  District Intent and Character. It is the intent of this district to promote regionally significant development that includes research and product development (R&D) facilities that compliment the education and research institutions of the SFEC and offer the possibility of adaptive reuse of existing warehouse buildings. 
New developments must be sensitive to the existing cemetery. Key multi-modal connections along College Avenue and Davie Road are vital to the overall success of this district. The potential for regional east-west transit along Interstate 595 calls for high-intensity residential and employment development, and public parking facilities to serve the entire Regional Activity Center, proximate to this potential transit alignment, centered near the northern terminus of College Avenue at SR 84. 
(3)  Development Pattern. It is the intent of this district that the existing street network of north-south and east-west streets be maintained and enhanced by infilling the existing "superblocks" (see Figure 506-2 below) with additional streets created as the area redevelops over time. A master street plan should be developed that determines approximately where new and extended streets should occur to substantially improve east-west connectivity within this district, and where mid-block alleys are feasible and should be provided. 
It is further intended that buildings will be placed close to, and oriented towards, perimeter streets in order to contribute to pedestrian activity on the streets and the attendant viability of retail and service establishments. Accordingly, parking should be internalized within a block, behind the buildings. 
Given the existing superblock pattern, it is expected that some blocks will continue to exceed the ideal dimensions identified in section 12-438.8, "Components of place; streets and blocks" after dedications are made. Within superblocks, it is permissible for there to be considerable internal building orientation provided that: perimeter buildings must still engage edge/perimeter streets; that parking is located behind the buildings; and, that pedestrian connections within and external to the development are provided. Figure 506-2 below illustrates the superblock pattern that consists of large blocks with a considerable number of internal buildings, oriented to parking facilities. The superblock is contrasted in the graphic with a basic urban block representative of a future condition in the RAC-TC District, where all buildings front and engage the street, and rear access is often provided via alleys for parking and loading functions. 
The only Auto-Oriented street is SR 84, which is characterized by high speeds and few traffic lights. In contrast to the remainder of the district, properties fronting SR 84 are required to provide a landscaped separation from the roadway. 

(4)  Principles and Objectives. 
(a)  Shared structured parking proximate to the proposed I-595 and College Avenue transit station with connecting shuttle service. 
(b)  The College Avenue, Davie Road and Nova Drive corridors should support and compliment the functions of the SFEC by providing residential opportunities and supporting retail and service opportunities. 
(c)  Re-use or redevelopment of industrial parcels for R&D, technology businesses and other university support uses, as well as residences and neighborhood services. 
(5)  Requirements. 
(a)  Permitted uses for this district can be found in Table 12-438.7(C). 
(b)  Intensity standards for this district can be found in Table 12.438.9(E). 
(c)  Site development standards can be found in Table 12-438.10(C). 
(d)  Building frontage regulations can be found in section 12-438.11. 
(B)  Davie Regional Research and High Tech District East District (RAC-RTE). 
(1)  General Boundaries. SR 84 to the north, the Oakes Road alignment to the south, Florida's Turnpike to the east, and Davie Road to the west. 
(2)  District Intent and Character. High potential for immediate development is the focus for this district. It is the intent of this district to promote regionally significant development that includes large-scale commercial development, and R&D that is complimentary to the educational and research institutions of the SFEC. 
More than one hundred (100) acres of lake can potentially be filled and developed. It is recognized that commercial or R&D use of these properties will likely serve as a catalyst for urban infill and redevelopment of the RAC. Mixing of retail and office uses with residential is encouraged. 
(3)  Development Pattern. There is no established street pattern within this district, which is comprised of large parcels and water. The regulations governing development within this district allow for flexible use of land, provided that key multi-modal connections are provided as shown on the adopted RAC master plan, consisting of the proposed Oakes Road extension west over Florida's Turnpike to Davie Road, and the extension of Reese Road south to Oakes Road. The master plan also encourages the creation of an additional east-west corridor in the vicinity of Nova Drive or to its north, that will connect Davie Road with Reese Road. 
Reese Road is considered an auto-oriented street where it parallels 84 and Florida's Turnpike. 
(4)  Principles and Objectives. 
(a)  Development of well-planned, large-scale commercial, office, entertainment, lodging, R&D, and technology uses, with a residential component. 
(b)  Catalyzing redevelopment of Davie's Regional Activity Center, and serving as a major draw of people to the area. 
(c)  Provide additional tax base for the town in an appropriate location. 
(5)  Requirements. 
(a)  Permitted uses for this district can be found in Table 12-438.7(C). 
(b)  Intensity standards for this district can be found in Table 12-438.9(E). 
(c)  Site development standards can be found in Table 12-438.10(C). 
(d)  Building frontage regulations can be found in section 12-438.11. 
(C)  South Florida Education District (RAC-ED). 
(1)  General Boundaries. North: approximately 300 feet south of Nova Drive; south: S.W. 39 th Street; east: Davie Road; and, west: College Avenue in the southern portion of the RAC-ED, and the southerly extension of SW 71 Terrace in the northern portion of the RAC-ED, encompassing the University of Florida agricultural field station. 
(2)  District Intent and Character. This district is unique to the others in that it is primarily occupied by educational entities including: Broward County School District; Broward County Community College; Florida Atlantic University; University of Florida IFAS; Mc Fatter Vocational Center; and, Nova Southeastern University. Together, these schools are known as the South Florida Education Center (SFEC). 
The focus of this district is to reduce vehicular impact on area roads as well as maximize land available for educational purposes. For the car to no longer dominate the landscape on these campuses, mobility alternatives must be provided, and parking should be centralized and structured, with connections to transit. Surface lots should be infilled with shared parking garages and education facilities. Strong multi-modal connections throughout the campuses are also vital along College Drive and Davie Road. Key pedestrian connections to the library and performing arts center centrally located in the district are encouraged. 
(3)  Development Pattern. The district is mainly comprised of educational campuses, characterized by a minimal number of roadways and general lack of interconnectivity, but also characterized as relatively cohesive and master planned developments on large parcels with focal and centralized open spaces and a pedestrian network that can be further enhanced. The campuses are characterized by outlying, on-site parking facilities with a park-once philosophy. 
It is the intent of this district to further develop the park-once philosophy by locating the parking off-campus proximate to the proposed east-west regional transit along the Interstate 595 corridor, with connecting north-south local transit. Achievement of this objective has the potential to reduce traffic congestion in and around the campuses, and to increase developable land on the campuses by reducing the amount of campus space that is occupied or planned for parking facilities. 
(4)  Principles and Objectives. 
(a)  Reduction of surface parking, replaced by structured parking and new buildings with ground floor retail and service uses oriented towards College Avenue and Nova Drive. 
(b)  Off-campus parking on the perimeter of the RAC with transit connections to the SFEC campuses. 
(c)  The College Avenue, Davie Road and Nova Drive corridors should support and compliment the functions of the SFEC by providing residential opportunities and supporting retail and service opportunities. For this to occur, the colleges would need to eliminate much of the existing surface parking along College Avenue and replace it with structured parking and intervening buildings that front College Avenue. 
(5)  Requirements. 
(a)  Permitted uses for this district can be found in Table 12-438.7(C). 
(b)  Intensity standards for this district can be found in Table 12-438.9(E). 
(c)  Site development standards can be found in Table 12-438.10(C). 
(d)  Building frontage regulations can be found in section 12-438.11. 
(D)  Davie Town Center District (RAC-TC). 
(1)  General Boundaries. S.W. 39 th Street and its easterly extension to the north, the C-11 Canal to the south, SW 61 st Avenue to the east, and the RAC boundary to the west. 
(2)  District Intent and Character. Located in the southern portion of the RAC, this district is also known as Downtown Davie, and is located within the Community Redevelopment Area. A portion of the RAC-TC District is governed by the Western Theme Overlay District Development Manual architectural and signage standards, which in the case of conflict take precedence over the architectural and signage standards and guidelines of this Division within Western Theme Overlay District. The district's focus will be on-street life and the civic center of the town. Town Hall and the Rodeo Grounds will anchor the area west of Davie Road. East of Davie Road, the area will be allowed to develop organically, with few constraints as to the location of use types, as a true mixed-use neighborhood including retail, office, service, lodging, and residential uses. These uses may occur in any compatible combination that complies with standards and regulations of this Division. Town Hall and Rodeo Grounds improvements, as well as a renewed commitment to the street will drive redevelopment renewed vibrancy in this district. 
(3)  Development Pattern. The existing street pattern is a semi-urban grid variation. A true urban grid pattern has north-south and east-west streets at regular and closely-spaced intervals. Missing street segments and new streets shown on the Downtown Davie Master Plan or subsequent plans for the area, should be infilled for better mobility. 
(4)  Principles and Objectives. 
(a)  Water retention handled in underground storage vaults and through pervious green space. 
(b)  The RAC-TC is envisioned as a mixed-use village. 
(c)  Centralized parking facilities to reduce on-site parking reliance. 
(5)  Requirements. 
For areas designated Western Theme Overlay District: 
(a)  The Western Theme Development Manual shall control architecture and signage. 
For all other areas of the RAC-TC District: 
(b)  Permitted uses for this district can be found in Table 12-438.7(C). 
(c)  Intensity standards for this district can be found in Table 12.438.9(E). 
(d)  Site development standards can be found in Table 12-438.10(C). 
(e)  Building frontage regulations can be found in section 12-438.11. 
(E)  Davie Downtown Neighborhood District, Low-Density (RAC-ND-2). 

Figure 506-3. RAC-DN2 District
(1)  General Boundary Description. Generally located north of Orange Drive, south of SW 39 th Street, east of SW 59 th Avenue and west of SW 54 th Avenue. 
(2)  District Intent and Character. This residential district has the opportunity to serve the entire RAC with a diverse offering of housing types and price points. The existing single-family residential character must be preserved in order to serve as a transition to an adjacent single-family detached neighborhood outside of the RAC zoning districts. A mix of single family detached homes, townhouses, and duplex and multiple-family dwellings designed to simulate single-family detached dwellings, will provide a compatible variety of housing types and price points (see "Principles and Objectives" "(c)" below. Pocket parks and safe walkable streets are encouraged to fulfill the ultimate possibility for this district. 
(3)  Development Pattern. The existing street network is a modified grid characterized by missing street segments and large water body interruptions to the grid. The network should be modified where possible to most closely approach an urban grid pattern for improved mobility within the neighborhood. 
(4)  Principles and Objectives. 
(a)  Establish on-street parking and rear alleys serving rear-yard parking where possible to create more walkable streets. 
(b)  New and remodeled dwellings should be located closer to the street, and utilize front porch design. 
(c)  The focus of redevelopment should be to maintain the single-family character of the neighborhood but to allow higher densities in the form of duplexes, townhomes, and even multiple-family structures, provided the building design and architectural characteristics are consistent with those of either attached or detached single-family homes, including but not limited to scale, mass, proportions, strategic use of entryways, roof design, and facade design and articulation. The illustrations that follow demonstrate the use of one (1) exterior entrance to serve two (2) or more dwelling units from an interior foyer. The first two (2) illustrations appear to be single-family detached dwellings because of both the internalization of some unit entrances and a single cohesive building design that lacks the repeating elements that would visually identify each dwelling unit within the building as is typically seen in duplexes and townhomes. 
  
Figure 506-4 
Figure 506-4. These buildings each contain three (3) dwelling units but appear to be one (1) single-family detached unit. These illustrations are not intended to depict the architectural theme of the RAC districts.

Figure 506-7 
  
Figure 506-7. This building appears to be a single-family attached dwelling (townhomes) but actually contains stacked flats through the use of some internalized unit entrances. 
(d)  Accessory dwelling units to single-family detached homes are permitted and encouraged where the accessory unit is located within the single-family dwelling, or where rear alley access exists to service detached accessory units. Detached accessory dwellings are most feasible when the principal single-family building is situated close to the street, thus providing adequate rear yard area for the accessory dwelling. 
(e)  Allow the establishment of one (1) to two (2) neighborhood commercial concentrations by special permit, consisting of no more than a few acres to serve the immediate retail and service needs of nearby residents. Parking provision should be minimal, and mixed-use structures with residences on the second story are encouraged, including live/work units. 
(5)  Requirements. 
(a)  Permitted uses for this district can be found in Table 12-438.7(C). 
(b)  Intensity standards for this district can be found in Table 12-438.9(E). 
(c)  Site development standards can be found in Table 12-438.10(C). 
(d)  Building frontage regulations can be found in section 12-438.11. 
(F)  Davie Downtown Neighborhood District, Medium-Density (RAC-ND-4). 
(1)  General Boundary Description. Generally located north of Orange Drive, south of the Oakes Road alignment, east of Davie Road and west of Florida's Turnpike. 
(2)  District Intent and Character. This primarily residential district has the opportunity to serve the entire RAC with a diverse offering of housing types and price points. Residential use must be preserved in order to serve as a large residential unit generator needed for the area. A mix of townhouse and multiple-family dwellings with the interspersion of retail and office in the transition zone to the west bordering the town center district will provide job opportunities and vitalization to this district. Pocket parks and safe walkable streets are encouraged to fulfill the ultimate possibility for this district. 
The area south of SW 42 nd Street, extending east from Betty Booth Roberts Park to the RAC-DN2 District boundary is industrial in nature, and is not conducive to redevelopment of adjacent properties. Redevelopment of the industrial properties into mixed-use (neighborhood retail or office, and residential), or as purely residential use is encouraged. Light industrial uses are permitted in recognition of the industrial history of the area, provided the requirements of this Division for building form and site design are met. 
(3)  Development Pattern. The existing street network is a modified grid characterized by missing street segments and large water body interruptions to the grid. The network should be modified where possible to most closely approach an urban grid pattern for improved mobility within the neighborhood. 
(4)  Principles and Objectives. 
(a)  Establish on-street parking and the rear alleys serving rear-yard parking where possible to create more walkable streets. 
(b)  New and remodeled dwellings should be located close to the street. 
(c)  The focus of redevelopment should be to expand and enhance multiple-family development of the neighborhood utilizing a stoop-frontage design. 
(d)  Accessory dwelling units to existing single-family detached homes are permitted and encouraged where the accessory unit is located within the single-family dwelling, and where rear alley access exists to service freestanding accessory units. Detached accessory dwellings are most feasible when the principal single-family building is situated close to the street, thus allowing adequate rear yard area for the accessory dwelling. 
(5)  Requirements. 
(a)  Permitted uses for this district can be found in Table 12-438.7(C). 
(b)  Intensity standards for this district can be found in Table 12.438.9(E). 
(c)  Site development standards can be found in Table 12-438.10(C). 
(d)  Building frontage regulations can be found in section 12-438.11. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.506), 12-5-12; Ord. No. 2013-21, § 2(Exh. A), 9-18-13) 
Sec. 12-438.7. - Permitted uses. 
(A)  Mixing of Uses. Uses can be mixed horizontally or vertically, subject to the rules of this subsection. 
(1)  Horizontal mixing via separate buildings is permitted, subject to compatible integration of buildings. Compatible integration shall ensure, at a minimum, that residential uses are not facing, proximate to or accessed through nonresidential loading areas; that all buildings within the development share one (1) harmonious architectural style, with nonresidential buildings having residential design features; and, nonresidential uses within separate buildings on the same lot as residential uses shall be limited to those uses that can also be integrated compatibly within the same building. 
(2)  Building setbacks and landscape buffers for mixed-use developments where the residential use is located in separate building(s) from the nonresidential use(s) but integrated into the overall development, shall be determined based upon the design of the proposed development as reflected in a master plan or site plan, as appropriate. 
(3)  Mixing of residential and nonresidential uses within the same building is encouraged in any location where both use types are permitted by Table 12-438.7(C), below, subject to functionally appropriate separation of the uses, which may include but is not limited to: separate stories; separate access; separation and buffering of residential units from loading areas and noisy nonresidential uses via one (1) or more intervening stories of office use, extra-thick concrete floors, soundproofing on ceilings, walls and sound-containing openings, operational standards and time limits, or other proven technique acceptable to the town. Live/work units shall provide internal access between the residential and nonresidential components. 
(4)  The residential and commercial portions of a live/work unit shall be mutually accessible from the interior of a building. 
(5)  Mixing of residential use with industrial uses shall be permitted only upon a town determination of compatibility, and shall require an upper floor location for residential use at the street frontage of the building. 
(B)  Accessory Uses are Permitted. Family day care homes and home occupations are subject to the detailed use provisions of section 12-34(J) and (N), respectively. One (1) accessory dwelling with up to seven hundred and fifty (750) square feet of floor area (see definition of Floor Area, Minimum in section 12-503 for calculation), is permitted accessory to a single-family detached 1 residence, subject to density limitations of the comprehensive plan. Accessory dwellings may be part of the principal building, or an accessory building, on the ground floor or an upper story.

A), 4-4-18) 
Sec. 12-438.8. - Components of place; streets and blocks. 
(A)  Principles. 
(1)  Walkability is the cornerstone and key to an urban area's efficient ground transportation. 
(2)  Safety and visual appeal are key elements of creating a pedestrian-friendly environment. Streets must be safe and attractive in order to attract and retain shoppers and residents. 
(a)  Provide on-street parking and landscaped bump-outs at intersections to separate pedestrians from moving vehicles. 
(b)  Provide landscape buffers in the sidewalks to further separate pedestrians from vehicles. 
(c)  Provide wide planted medians in the middle of the street when prescribed by the applicable street section in section 12-438.28, to provide a more intimate scale and reduce vehicular speed. 
(d)  Provide sidewalk width along Transit-Oriented Streets as prescribed by the applicable cross-sections, with comfortable seating and lighting. 
(e)  Provide shade trees, arcades, galleries, awnings and canopies to provide cover from rain and moderate temperatures on the sidewalk along the building's street frontage. Provide quality architectural detail in streetscape amenities and building facades to increase interest, appearance, and richness in the pedestrian experience. 
(f)  Provide views to intriguing vistas to help entice people to walk longer distances. 
(g)  Design intersections to reduce crossing distances, provide clearly marked crosswalks that are aligned with sidewalks and provide automatic crosswalk signals. 
(3)  Alternate, parallel paths of travel enhance all modes of mobility, and reduce reliance on single, multi-lane and high-speed arterials and collectors that inhibit pedestrian and bicycle activity. This in turn enables multi-lane roadways to incorporate on-street parking and wider sidewalks, both of which enhance retail and pedestrian activity. The creation of new and extended streets where shown on the adopted RAC Master Plan and conceptualized within the district development pattern provisions of section 12-438.6 will enhance overall connectivity within the RAC. Three (3) major road connections include Oakes Road between SR 7 and Davie Road, the extension of Reese Road to Oakes Road, and the creation of an additional east-west street in the vicinity of Nova Drive or north. 
(4)  Symbols of the Community. Defining a character for each street type allows visitors to be more aware of the function of the street. Street scale and symbols along the street improves way finding ability and creates a unique sense of place that will be remembered. 
(a)  Use landmark treatment at entry streets to announce arrival. 
(b)  Use pavers and specialty landscape treatment at crosswalks and major streets to define important intersections. 
(c)  Use different tree species to indicate varying street types. 
(d)  Use town seal or town name on key site amenities to reinforce the sense of place. 
(5)  An urban block typically has a perimeter measuring approximately eighteen hundred (1,800) linear feet. In South Florida's urban areas, this usually translates into blocks measuring three hundred (300) feet by six hundred (600) feet, or closer to four hundred (400) feet by five hundred (500) feet. The maximum length of an urban block should not exceed seven hundred (700) feet, and the perimeter measurement should not exceed two thousand (2,000) linear feet. 
(B)  Requirements. 
(1)  The extension of existing streets located within the RAC districts shall occur where the town determines that such extensions will bridge gaps in the street network and substantially enhance connectivity, and further provided that such extensions do not constitute an undue hardship or disproportionate burden upon any one (1) property. Development of a master right-of-way plan to this end shall be guided by the development pattern provisions of section 12-438.6, and within the RAC-TC District as specified on the adopted master plan for same, as may be amended from time to time. 
(2)  Corner curb radii should be between four (4) and fifteen (15) feet. These fairly tight turning radii are intended to shorten pedestrian crossings and inhibit drivers from turning corners at high speeds. To allow for emergency vehicles such as fire trucks to turn corners, a 25-foot radius clear zone shall be established free of all vertical obstructions including but not limited to telephone poles, sign poles, fire hydrants, electrical boxes, and newspaper boxes. 
(3)  Pedestrian passages leading from the street to the middle of a block shall be provided along Transit-Oriented Streets when there is a distance of seven hundred fifty (750) feet or more in between cross-streets or dedicated through-block pathways. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.508), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-438.9. - Intensity of use standards. 
(A)  All development is subject to the allocation of density and intensity promulgated for the Regional Activity Center in the future land use element of the adopted comprehensive plan. 
(B)  Pursuant to section 12-438.4, "Applicability," Article IV, "District Performance Standards and Capacity Analysis" shall not apply. 
(C)  Minimum and maximum intensities of use are established on Table 12-438.9(E), below. 
(D)  Incentives must be used in order to achieve the maximum allowable height and impervious area. The schedule of incentives, Table 12-438.9(F) follows the table of intensity standards

(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A), 12-5-12; Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.510), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-438.11. - Building frontage types and regulations; right-of-way encroachments. 
(A)  Intent: The area where a building faces the street and meets with the sidewalk is generally referred to as the "building frontage". It is here that the interaction occurs between people on the sidewalk and businesses in the buildings. There are three (3) main reasons for controlling building frontage: 
(1)  To define the edge of each street corridor, thereby establishing a sense of enclosure. 
(2)  To ensure a high level of pedestrian interest through continuous and visually interesting facades close to the sidewalk and interactive facades, allowing the pedestrian to view inside, and those inside to monitor the sidewalk and street. 
(3)  To increase commerce by supporting a high level of activity along the street. 
Therefore, buildings should align their facades along the build to line. Street level restaurants, shops, stores, and offices are all accessed at that line, and the more continuous it is the greater possibility for success they will all experience. Gaps in between buildings will create areas of low activity and low commercial potential in the same way a vacant lot will, and should be avoided wherever possible. 
Building frontages are controlled by build-to-lines and minimum and maximum setbacks, which are regulated by the types of streets that they front (which often correlate to a given RAC district). 
(B)  All buildings on lots with Transit-Oriented Street frontage shall have their principal frontage (i.e. main entrance and architectural orientation) along such street. All buildings on lots with other collector or arterial roadways shall have their principal frontage on the highest such street classification or as otherwise determined by the town.

(2)  Subject to town council approval (See section 12-438.22). Other frontage types may be permitted if they are consistent with the intent of the frontage requirements for the lot. 
(3)  Frontage requirements within the Western Theme Overlay District are set forth within the Western Theme Development Manual. 
(D)  Description of Frontage Types. 
(1)  Arcade: 
(a)  A frontage wherein the facade of the upper stories project forward of the BTL over a colonnade that covers the sidewalk. The arcade shall extend to within three and one-half to four (4) feet from the back edge of the curb as determined by the town based upon existing and proposed right-of-way improvements and conditions, thereby enclosing the sidewalk and discouraging pedestrians from bypassing it. The first floor facade under the arcade shall be shopfront at the BTL. An arcade shall have a minimum twelve (12) foot vertical clearance and a minimum dimension of twelve (12) feet of width between the outer edge of the columns and the first floor building facade (see illustration below). 
(b)  The town may allow an arcade wherein the facade of the upper stories, and the face of the columns are vertically aligned with the BTL in order to accommodate unique ground floor uses such as a concentration of outdoor dining or the placement of kiosks within the sidewalk outside of the arcade. The first floor facade under the arcade shall be shopfront, and it should be set back no more than twelve (12) feet from the BTL. A minimum vertical clearance of twelve (12) feet under the arcade is required. A public sidewalk easement shall be dedicated under such an arcade. 
  
Figure 511-1 
(2)  Gallery: A frontage wherein the facade is located at the back edge of the sidewalk (BTL) with an attached cantilevered shed or a lightweight colonnade overlapping the sidewalk for the entire street frontage of a building. The gallery shall extend to within no less four (4) feet from the back edge of the curb, thereby enclosing the sidewalk and discouraging pedestrians from bypassing it. The first floor facade under the gallery shall be shopfront at the BTL. The Gallery shall have a minimum twelve (12) foot vertical clearance. 
(3)  Shopfront: A frontage type wherein the facade is located at the back edge of the sidewalk (BTL) at grade, with a substantial glazing on the sidewalk level, and an awning projecting at least seven (7) feet forward of the BTL when the shopfront is not combined with a gallery or arcade frontage. The awning shall extend for at least eighty (80) percent of the building facade. A minimum seventy (70) percent of the facade width shall be glazed between two (2) feet and eight (8) feet above the sidewalk, and shall not be reflective or opaque. A portion of the building frontage may be recessed as permitted in section 12-438.10(C) in order to create a covered alcove in which outdoor dining or merchandising can occur. Shopfront entries may be recessed up to two (2) feet with display windows angled inwards from the facade to doorway for clear pedestrian view to the interior. 
(4)  Modified Shopfront: A frontage type wherein the facade is located at the back edge of the sidewalk (BTL) at grade, with sufficient glazing on the sidewalk level to allow for cross-visibility between pedestrians on the sidewalk and occupants inside the building. An awning shall project at least seven (7) feet forward from the BTL and shall extend for at least eighty (80) percent of the building facade. A minimum fifty (50) percent and a maximum seventy-five (75) percent of the facade width shall be glazed between two (2) feet and eight (8) feet above the sidewalk, and shall not be reflective or opaque. Entries may be recessed up to two (2) feet but display windows angled inwards from the facade to doorway are not permitted. 
(4a)  Stoop: A frontage type wherein the facade is constructed at a build-to-line that is very close to the street line, with a lower story that elevated at least eighteen (18) inches but not more than thirty-six (36) inches above the sidewalk to establish a sense of transition from public to private realm, and to secure privacy for the windows. The access is a landing or platform with steps leading to the sidewalk, which may encroach forward of the BTL to the street line. In the event thatthe lower story is not elevated at least eighteen (18) inches above the sidewalk, the elevated platform (stoop) shall serve to establish the sense of transition from public to private realm, and shall require steps leading down to finished floor level within the building. 

Figure 511-2
(5)  Porch: A frontage type wherein the facade is located at a build-to-line that is separated from, but relatively close to, the street line, with an attached porch at least eight (8) feet wide and six (6) feet deep located forward of the BTL. The porch shall extend at least five (5) feet forward of the build-to-line, and shall approach no closer than two and a half (2.5) feet to the sidewalk. Porches shall be elevated at least eighteen (18) inches above the sidewalk and adjacent grade. 

Figure 511-3. Left: Porch frontage. Right: Modified porch frontage. 
(5a)  Modified Porch: A frontage type that utilizes a first-floor porch with upper floors and/or continuous balconies extending over the porch, but not forward of the BTL. This frontage type is intended for streets of a lesser hierarchy, intensity and sidewalk width than Transit-Oriented Streets. The front edge of the porch shall be coterminous with the BTL, and may be up to ten (10) feet in depth from the BTL. The porch shall count towards the minimum required percentage of building frontage that must coincide with the BTL pursuant to Table 12-438.10(C). The porch shall either be elevated at least eighteen (18) inches above grade or kept at grade but separated from the public sidewalk by a decorative railing. 

Rear-most building features and at-grade modified porch
(E)  Other Frontage Requirements. 
(1)  Building facades that are subject to street build-to-lines or maximum setbacks from the street shall be built parallel to the principal frontage line, or parallel to the tangent of a curved principal frontage line (see Figure 511-1, below). This provision is not intended to limit or preclude alcoves or variations in the plane of the street-front facade. 

Figure 511-5
(2)  Streetscreens used to shield vehicular use areas from sidewalks shall be solid and opaque below three (3) feet in height, and at least thirty-five (35) percent open-screening above three (3) feet (ex: iron or aluminum) consistent with Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles, and constructed and painted to match the adjacent building facade. 
(3)  Mechanical equipment is not permitted along any street frontage. Screening of all mechanical equipment is required. 
(4)  The front or side (in case of corner lots) of every building must face the street. Rear facing buildings, loading docks, overhead doors and service entries are prohibited on street-facing facades. This paragraph shall not apply to lots within the RAC-RTE District that do not front a Transit-Oriented Street. 
(5)  All principal buildings shall have a principal entrance opening to a street, square, plaza, or sidewalk. The principal entrance shall not open onto a parking lot. This paragraph shall not apply to lots within the RAC-RTE District that do not front a Transit-Oriented Street. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2010-021, § 4, 9-7-10; Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.511), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-438.12. - Rules of transition. 
(A)  RAC-RTW and RAC-ED development on lots abutting a residential zoning district outside of the RAC, and any M-1 District use that is established after the effective date of this provision and is adjacent a use that is not first permitted in any "M" District, shall provide a landscape buffer as required in section 12-111(D) for industrial districts adjacent to residential zoning. RAC-TC development on lots abutting residential zoning outside of the RAC shall either be residential and of like dimensions and character as the adjoining permitted uses, or shall provide the landscape buffer required in section 12-111(D). 
(B)  Buildings on lots adjacent to residential zoning outside the RAC shall be set back from said district boundary at least one and one-half (1.5) feet for each foot of height measured to the eave or parapet of the roof. For example, a building in a RAC district with a fifty (50) foot setback from a residential zoning boundary may be no higher than thirty-three (33) feet as measured to the eave or parapet of the roof. 
(C)  Nonresidential or mixed-use buildings abutting, or separated by a street or alley in the rear yard from, a residential zoning district (including RAC-DN2) that permits residential buildings of a maximum two (2) floors in height, shall provide a ten-foot-wide landscape buffer. A six (6) foot wall, hedge or other durable landscape barrier shall be installed. One (1) 14- to 16-foot tree shall be planted for each forty (40) linear feet of property line or fraction thereof, along with a continuous hedge. The shrub and/or wall requirement of this section may be waived if the adjoining property has a buffer that meets the minimum requirements of this provision. 
(D)  No loading space or outdoor storage shall be permitted within one hundred (100) feet of a residential zoning district boundary (including RAC-DN2), nor shall any loading space face a residential zoning district boundary. 
(E)  Height Transitions. 
(1)  Where the maximum permitted height within a district exceeds the greater of four (4) stories or sixty- five (65) feet, allowable building heights shall "step-up" from the facade facing arterial and collector streets. These "height contours" shall allow additional height on a 1:1 vertical to horizontal basis until the district maximum is reached, except as provided below. For example, to achieve a building height of ninety (90) feet, that portion of the building exceeding sixty-five (65) feet would have to be set back an additional twenty-five (25) feet from the building face along the collector or arterial street. This can be accomplished in as many increments as desired (see Figure 512-1 below). No such step-up shall be required adjacent to Florida's Turnpike or the I-595/SR 84 corridor (including Reese Road frontage). 

Figure 512-1
(2)  Buildings exceeding either three (3) stories or thirty-five (35) feet in height shall employ one (1) or more of the following techniques for ensuring compatibility with an abutting, conforming single-family detached residence, as deemed acceptable and effective by the town: 
(a)  Reduce the perceived mass of the building and the height differential by stepping the building down on the side(s) abutting the single-family detached residence. 
(b)  Provide adequate separation between buildings to minimize the perceived height difference and lower the line-of-sight from the taller building to the single-family property. 
(c)  Use appropriate landscape materials and buffering techniques to screen the taller building from the single-family residence and obstruct the line of sight between the buildings. 
(d)  For upper story windows, use glass block, low awnings or high windows to obstruct line of sight to the single-family property, and/or the strategic location of building functions and windows to maximize privacy for the single-family lot. 
(e)  Use green (landscaped) terraces to obstruct line-of-site to the single-family property. 

Figure 512-2
Figure 512-2 illustrates a combination of techniques including the use of step-downs in height to reduce mass and height differential, trees and landscaped terraces to block line of site and provide a buffer. Varying the horizontal plane of the facade and using color variations also reduces the apparent mass of the building. 

Figure 512-3

Figure 512-4
These are examples of green terraces that can be employed to afford privacy between buildings and soften the impact of larger, taller buildings. Such use of landscaping can also assist with stormwater capture and building energy efficiency. 
(3)  Lots with frontage on a Transit-Oriented Street can be developed to six (6) stories and ninety-five (95) feet without any horizontal stepping if at least one-half (1/2) of the lot's street frontage is located within two hundred and fifty (250) feet of the center of the intersection of any two (2) Transit-Oriented Streets, and if all quadrants of the intersection are zoned to permit height exceeding four (4) stories and sixty-five (65) feet. Additional height, up to the district maximum, may be achieved by 1:1 stepping. 
(F)  Adjacent Nonconformities. When a site plan under review for development or redevelopment borders nonconforming development, the site plan shall consider the discontinuity of public improvements (ex: sidewalk width and location) or other incompatibilities that will result at the site edges, and which may endure until the adjacent property(ies) are developed/redeveloped. The site plan shall propose a transition between the proposed conforming development and adjacent nonconforming development that is acceptable to the town. 
(G)  Existing and proposed residential uses including mixed uses shall be designed to be integrated into the existing neighborhoods created through the implementation of the RAC. Compatibility and appropriate transitional design elements will be reviewed at time of site plan review, consistent with these land development regulations. Such regulations in review shall ensure that existing industrial uses will not become incompatible with new development and that new development shall provide buffers and site design in light of exiting land uses. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.512), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-438.13. - Use of public right-of-way; required improvements and dedications. 
(A)  Intent and Character. The public right-of-way should be envisioned as a primary place of activity. Using and invigorating the right-of-way along the streets is the single most important element to redeveloping a pedestrian-friendly, multi-modal community. The right-of-way will incorporate vehicular, pedestrian, and bicycle improvements. The town and the private developer should work together to make sure there is a seamless relationship between building entrances, plazas, sidewalks, and crosswalks. A continuous, attractive, and enjoyable experience is the goal for the pedestrian. The public right-of-way will serve the community by offering places for activities such as sidewalk seating, people watching, waiting on transit, small gatherings, and street vendor opportunities. In order for a safe and comfortable pedestrian experience to be achieved, shelter from sun and rain is encouragedthrough continuous awnings, covered walks, landscape and umbrella coverage of the sidewalk. 
(B)  Principles. 
(1)  Pedestrian experience and amenities should be the priority when allocating funds for right-of-way improvements; no longer should right-of-way improvements be solely focused on the automobile. 
(2)  Building occupants are encouraged to add elements such as decorative pots, cafe seating and awnings in areas of the sidewalk approved by the town. 
(3)  Pervious pavers and extensive plant beds added to the public use areas are encouraged to reduce storm water runoff. 
(4)  Shade trees and light surfaces shall be utilized to increase the urban tree canopy and reduce heat. 
(5)  Utilizing continuous trenches for planting street trees and shrubs allows for a better root system that results in healthier longer living large trees. 
(6)  Transit stops should be integrated into the overall design of the street and the adjacent building. 
(7)  Street vendors are encouraged in areas where plaza or other gathering space is of adequate size. 
(8)  Where allowed, on-street parking with planter bulb-outs is encouraged. 
(9)  A pedestrian bridge over SR 84 should connect the east-west rapid transit station to the College Avenue corridor. 
(C)  Requirements. 
(1)  The developer of each development site shall be responsible for burying overhead power and utility lines along Transit-Oriented Streets and along all streets within the RAC-TC and RAC-RTW districts, and providing sidewalks, street lighting, street furniture and other improvements within the right-of-way adjacent to development site pursuant to the applicable street section(s) in section 12-438.28, "Street sections" and the specifications for same adopted by the town council. The town may permit payment in lieu of construction for improvements that the town will undertake on an areawide basis. 
(2)  Right-of-way shall be dedicated to fulfill the street section requirements in section 12-438.28. 
(3)  Greenway dedications shall be required pursuant to an open space and drainage master plan, when adopted. 
(4)  The several components that must be integrated into the design of rights-of-ways are transit shelters and bicycle lockers that are easily accessible to pedestrians, lighting, shade (from trees, awnings, arcades, and canopies), site furnishing, and directory signage. 
(5)  No structure or landscaping shall impede pedestrian or bike circulation within the right-of-way. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2010-021, § 5, 9-7-10; Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.513), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-438.14. - Massing and articulation. 
(A)  Intent. Massing refers to the bulk plane of a building. The perception of building mass is influenced by the building's distance from the street, its height relative to its width, whether height is reached in one (1) or multiple vertical and/or horizontal planes, and the spacing between buildings. Articulation refers to the treatment of a building's facade. A blank facade has no articulation. A facade with substantial fenestration, balconies, character lines, columns, etc. is highly articulated. Buildings are the face of the town. Their form, quality, interest, function, and style all serve to define the character of this place. 
(B)  Principles. 
(1)  Buildings are encouraged to vary in overall height and not be contained in a single volume of continuous height. 
(a)  All buildings that front Transit-Oriented streets and other collector and arterial streets are encouraged to display a uniform cornice height between twenty-five (25) and thirty-five (35) feet above finished grade. This cornice height should consist of a uniform alteration to the building massing for a minimum of four (4) feet perpendicular to the vertical surface. Buildings exceeding thirty-five (35) feet in height should maintain no more than three (3) stories without horizontal moderation in vertical surface plane. This moderation should consist of a minimum four (4) foot horizontal variation in surface plane such as brise soleil, balconies, building projections, etc. Repetitive moderations are discouraged. 
(b)  The first thirty-five (35) feet of the exterior facade vertical plane should enhance the pedestrian environment by incorporating appropriate architectural features. Such features include cornice, molding stringcourses, ornamentations, changes in material or color, and other sculpting of the architectural surface, which add special interest and are compatible with public sector site elements. 
(2)  Pedestrian bridges extending over public right-of-way may be permitted providing those connections have secured legitimate air rights over the public corridor and meet all applicable codes. The location of pedestrian bridges should be limited to building complexes where buildings share common needs/uses or when the interaction between users of the buildings is important for the success of the use. A connection over SR 84 to future east-west rapid transit is considered a necessity once the transit infrastructure is in place. All over street connections should be of exceptional design, which enhance the visual and functional quality of the streetscape and should be compatible with site elements. 
(3)  Where possible, rooftops should be designed to accommodate various forms of human activity such as sun decks, tennis courts, gardens, outdoor cafes, etc. Roof surfaces not allocated to human activity should be finished with a surface material that does not affect the quality of views from surrounding buildings or site lines from taller buildings should be directed way from unsightly rooftops. All rooftop mechanical equipment, stair, and elevator towers should be designed as an integral part of the building volume and/or adequately screened. Rooftops designed and used to hold topsoil and landscape plantings (green roofs) are encouraged. See also section 12-438.26, "Green building." 
(4)  Facades of buildings should be divided into individual storefronts or entries. 
(5)  Large expanses of glass should be subdivided into smaller units. 
(6)  Differentiation should be provided at the base and the top of windows (see Figure 514-1 for illustrations of this concept). 
  
Figure 514-1 
(7)  The ground-level floors should be visually separated from floors above through the use of architectural elements that could include galleries, awnings, canopies or lintels, or by recessing the ground-floor level from the floor above (arcade frontages). 
(8)  A visible and delineated roofline is encouraged, such as a cornice, pediment, or related visual trim. The upper termination of a building should be more strongly developed in a building with a flat or slightly sloping roof (see Figure 12-514-1 for illustrations of this concept). 
(9)  Store entrances should be recessed, not flush, with the edge of the building facade, to provide shelter for persons entering and exiting, to articulate the facade, and to provide maximum window display area at the entrance. 
(10)  Landscaping should provide additional texture at street level as well as increase pedestrian awareness of buildings, their entrances and the visual access. Decorative planters are encouraged as well as trees planted utilizing tree grates. 
(11)  Building design should encourage multi-tenant occupancy at the lower two (2) floors. 
(12)  Solid walls should not exceed twenty (20) feet in length without vertical articulation. 
(13)  Ornamental fountains, waterfalls, sculptures, arbors, trellises, planted beds, clock pedestals, awnings, and canopies are encouraged. 
(14)  False fronts or parapets that create an insubstantial appearance should be avoided. 
(15)  Stepping the building (see Figures 12-512-1 and 12-512-2) can also reduce the apparent scale of the building and establish a "base" and a "top." 
(16)  Changes in mass should relate to structural system(s) and the organization of interior space. 
(17)  New development, or the retrofitting of existing development, should address the public sidewalk. Design of the sidewalk-level facade should be incorporated into the design of the overall building. 
(18)  Street frontage facades should have entryways at reasonable intervals, typically no more than fifty (50) feet apart. 
(19)  Ground level facades that face the street should be designed with entrances, windows, display windows, or other display devices. 
(C)  Requirements. This subsection applies to buildings other than industrial buildings within the RAC-RTW and RAC-RTE districts that have no frontage on arterial or collector roads, or that are substantially screened from such roads. 
(1)  Facades shall be constructed in a manner to appear substantial, avoiding low-quality building materials and construction details that contribute to the perception of a facade as flimsy, or are inconsistent with the materials and architectural style. 
(2)  The building facade shall use architectural solutions (e.g. building materials, texture, offset building massing, repetition of columns, recess entries, windows, and awnings) to avoid the creation of impenetrable, un-articulated building facades. 
(3)  Landscape elements shall never impede pedestrian circulation. 
(4)  Single dominant building masses are prohibited. 
(5)  Substantial variations in massing shall include changes in height and horizontal plane. 
(6)  Horizontal mass shall not exceed a height to width ratio of one to three (1:3), without a substantial architectural element that either projects up or away from the building, such as a tower, bay, lattice, or other architectural feature. 
(7)  Building massing, architectural details, entry details or changes in materials shall be used to highlight the location of building entries. For example, greater height can be used to accentuate entries in the form of tower elements, tall voids, or a central mass at an entry plaza. 
(8)  Buildings that are part of an existing or future complex shall have a unity of character and design. The design character of buildings shall be such that it is aesthetically pleasing and without cluttered forms having no apparent system of organization. 
(9)  All building elevations shall receive architectural treatment, although the primary emphasis may be given to the main facade(s). 
(10)  All development must be designed to enhance ground-level architectural elements on a human scale. Entry conditions, building materials, awnings, windows, lighting, and well-designed signage can all contribute to conditions ideal for attracting pedestrians. 
(11)  All buildings shall have a minimum of two (2) planes of vertical separation. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2010-021, § 6, 9-7-10; Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.514), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-438.15. - Miscellaneous requirements. 
(A)  Screening required. 
(1)  Dumpsters, dumpster enclosures and loading zones shall not be located within twenty (20) feet of any street line or BTL. 
(2)  Dumpsters and their enclosures and loading zones shall be screened from view at the street frontage by a building or screenwall six (6) feet in height with a planter at the street-facing base of the screenwall, provided that the town may require additional screening if necessary to obscure same from street view. 
(3)  Utility boxes and machinery, including but not limited to backflow devices, electric meters, air conditioning units, and transformer boxes, shall not be visible from public rights-of-way, parks and other public spaces. 
(4)  Loading areas shall be screened from view from streets and properties with conforming residential uses. 
(B)  Reserved. 
(C)  Street furniture. Street furniture, including but not limited to, benches, transit shelters, waste bins, bike racks or lockers shall be of a uniform style within the district, as specified by the town. 
(D)  Measurement of street-side setbacks and build-to-lines shall be measured from the ultimate street right-of-way lines that include any dedication(s) required to achieve the adopted street sections within the RAC. 
(E)  Airport noise compatibility. In accordance with Broward County Ordinance # 2010-44, none of the three thousand one hundred seventy-four (3,174) dwelling units approved by way of Broward County Land Use Plan Amendment PCT 10-6 shall be located within the sixty (60) DNL noise contour of Runway 9R/27L, pursuant to Environmental Impact Statement, December 2008 2020 B1b. The town shall make the noise contour map available to the public in the same manner as zoning maps. The town shall be responsible for the monitoring of residential development activity within the RAC. 
(F)  Drive-through windows. 
(1)  Generally. Drive-through windows, such as for banks and fast food restaurants, are permitted as pursuant to this paragraph (F). 
(2)  Vehicle stacking. As determined by the town engineer, drive-through windows shall provide sufficient vehicle stacking to ensure that vehicles to do not back out onto public streets or neighboring properties and do not hinder pedestrian or vehicular access throughout the site. 
(3)  Food service uses. In the RAC-TC district, food service uses shall not include drive-through facilities. This is not intended to prohibit the continuation of food service drive-through facilities lawfully established prior to May 4, 2016. 
(4)  Other uses. In the RAC-TC district, drive-through facilities for uses other than food service are allowed provided that vehicular access to such drive-through facility is not by way of a transit-oriented street. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2011-28, § 2, 8-17-11; Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A), 12-5-12; Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.515), 12-5-12; Ord. No. 2016-014, § 2(Exh. A), 7-27-16; Ord. No. O2019-004, § 2(Exh. A), 1-23-19) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O2019-004, § 2(Exh. A), adopted January 23, 2019, renamed § 12-438.15 from "supplemental regulations" to "miscellaneous requirements." 
Sec. 12-438.16. - Nonconformities. 
(A)  Lawfully established lots within the Regional Activity Center Districts which do not meet the minimum lot area or lot dimension requirements of this division shall be governed by section 12-38. 
(B)  Except as set forth in paragraph (C) below, lawfully established uses within the Regional Activity Center Districts which do not comply with the standards of section 12-438.7 shall be governed by section 12-40. 
(C)  Nonconforming characteristics of use which are unique to this Division, such as but not limited to the intensity of use standards, site development standards, building frontage types and parking location standards, shall not be governed by section 12-39 but instead shall be governed by the following. 
(1)  Renovations. Interior renovations and renovations or modifications to the exterior of a nonconforming building are permitted without triggering compliance of said building with the standards of this Division provided that the building footprint is unchanged. 
(2)  Expansion of building. The expansion of a nonconforming building shall be permitted as long as the cumulative square-footage of such expansion within any five (5) year period does not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the gross floor area of a building, as it existed on February 6, 2008. In the event that the cumulative five (5) year threshold is met, compliance with these regulations shall be required if the town determines that substantial compliance with these regulations can be achieved without compromising the intended use of the expansion and logistics of the building and site layout. 
(D)  RAC-RTE and RAC-RTW districts. In the RAC-RTE and RAC-RTW districts, uses first allowed in the M-2 District which were lawfully established prior to February 06, 2008 shall be permitted to operate, expand and change to other M-2 uses without limitation, and shall not be subject to the limitations of section section 12-40 until after January 1, 2023, after which time, the provisions of section 12-40 shall apply, except that the threshold for a use to be considered "discontinued" or "abandoned" shall be one (1) year. The provisions of this paragraph are temporary and transitional in nature and shall not in any way be interpreted to confer any rights to the use of land or structure beyond what is temporarily permitted herein. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.516), 12-5-12; Ord. No. 2013-21, § 2(Exh. A), 9-18-13; Ord. No. 2014-2, § 2(Exh. A), 1-15-14; Ord. No. O2019-004, § 2(Exh. A), 1-23-19) 
Sec. 12-438.17. - Off-street parking requirements. 
(A)  Intent and applicability. This section is intended to minimize both the actual and perceived presence and dominance of parking facilities within designated corridors by prescribing the location of, and access to, parking facilities via the rear of properties, away from the street, and by minimizing the potential for "overparking", which occurs when there is an oversupply of parking spaces. It is also the intent of these regulations to encourage the provision of strategically centralized public parking with transit connections, and on-street parking that further reduces the amount of off-street parking that must be provided. 
    The parking paradigm used in this section reflects an urbanizing, but not yet urban area, where alternate modes of transportation and shared parking facilities begin to reduce demand for parking spaces. As strategically located centralized public parking is provided and multi-modal infrastructure and service improves over time, the parking space requirements should be adjusted to reflect the modal shift that is expected to occur. 
    Parking and loading requirements and vehicular use area design geometrics shall comply with Article VII except as provided in this section. 
(B)  Driveway Allowances. The Town of Davie seeks to have buildings fronting the entire width of their lots along Transit-Oriented Streets, as well as many other streets within the RAC districts. Wherever these regulations require buildings to occupy the entire width of a lot, off-street parking facilities must be provided in the rear yard, accessed by a side street or an alley, or contiguous rear parking areas with through-access that together function like an alley. If no such infrastructure exists, driveway access is permitted as follows. However, it is required that new development be designed in a way to create opportunity for these connections to be made when adjacent lots are redeveloped in the future. 
(1)  When vehicular access is necessary within the street frontage, it will be limited to a single curb cut for access in and out, provided two (2), one-way drives may be permitted if necessary for parking facility circulation. 
(2)  Additional driveways may be permitted for lots where sufficiently high trip generation requires extra driveways, as determined by the town engineer. 
(3)  Driveways should be located along side property lines within shared access easements to encourage connection from adjacent properties. Under such circumstances, the minimum separation requirement between driveways and property lines shall be waived. The town may require easements for future sharing of driveway access. 
(4)  Every rear parking facility shall be designed for connectivity to existing or future rear parking facilities on adjoining properties with the same street frontage. This shall include the recording of cross-access easements. 
(5)  As redevelopment occurs, connections shall be made between rear parking lots on neighboring lots. This connectivity will reduce the need for curb cuts along the street, and allow opportunity for those driveways to be redeveloped for building frontage, paseos, or outdoor building space. 
(6)  In order to encourage existing developed lots to connect their rear parking facilities to those of adjoining lots, up to five (5) percent of the required parking may be eliminated if logistically necessary to provide said connections. Parking facilities that are nonconforming as to required number of spaces by five (5) percent or more shall not qualify. 
(C)  Alleys. Few blocks in the RAC are bisected by alleys. The benefit of rear alleys are that they allow for a continuous building frontage and fewer vehicle-pedestrian conflicts. Alleys may be incorporated into rear parking lots as standard drive aisles. 
(D)  Through-Block Pathways (paseos). Through-block pathways refer to interior on-site pedestrian walkways that are not located within a public right of way (but may be located on public property). The alignment of these pathways, where required, shall take into account pedestrian connections shown in the comprehensive plan, proposed, and existing buildings and to the extent possible property lines to enhance the pedestrian environment and connections to adjacent property. Paseos shall be designed to enhance the surrounding buildings and to provide community amenities. 
(E)  Parking Placement and Design. The intent of parking placement regulations is to de-emphasize parking lots from the public streetscape and to provide an environment conducive to pedestrian activity by locating parking lots and their access away from street frontages, where the following provisions shall apply. Strategically located peripheral public parking facilities with transit, bicycle, and pedestrian connections are specifically encouraged. 
(1)  No surface parking shall be located within twenty-five (25) feet of any street line that forms the basis of a build-to-line, except as provided in (11), below. 
(2)  Parking spaces shall be screened from view at all frontage lines by a building or screenwall six (6) feet in height with a planter at the street-facing base of the screenwall, except as provided in eleven (11), below, and except for lots within the RAC-RTE district that do not front a Transit-Oriented Street. 
(3)  Parking structures shall be set back at least fifty (50) feet from all Transit-Oriented Streets and any street for which a build-to-line is established herein. The intent of this setback is to ensure that adequate space exists for a liner building, as encouraged below, even if the liner building is not constructed at the time the parking structure is built. Parking structures should be enclosed by a liner building built along all of said street frontages a minimum thirty (30) feet deep, and not less than two (2) floors and twenty-five (25) feet in height measured to the roof eave or parapet. The liner building may be attached or detached from the parking structure. 
(4)  If inadequate lot width precludes a parking structure with liner building along a street, the parking structure may be built to the BTL and architectural solutions shall be utilized, such as creation of a false facade, provided that one (1) of the permitted frontage types shall be utilized, and that the first floor shall be inhabitable and usable for one (1) or more permitted uses. 
(5)  Street level openings to parking structures may occur only on side streets (not primary or urban secondary) and shall be minimized to accommodate necessary vehicle entrances and pedestrian access only. 
(6)  Gates/ticket machines within any parking facility must allow for one (1) vehicle to stack exclusive of public right-of-way. 
(7)  Where corner access and rear access exists, access shall be from the rear except as provided in (11), below. 
(8)  Drive-thru service windows, including vehicular stacking lanes, are prohibited except in the rear yard, and shall not be permitted within one hundred (100) feet of a property line zoned, land use plan designated or occupied for single-family residential use, provided that no drive-thru window or stacking lane shall be visible from a public right-of-way. 
(9)  Single-family detached housing may provide parking in the side yard if neither on-street parking or rear alley access is available, however, front yard parking is prohibited. 
(10)  All other residential types shall provide only rear yard parking. 
(11)  Front or side yard parking for flex space developments that require extensive loading areas, and which have multiple-tenant offices facing street, may be authorized by a level one (1) adjustment. 
(12)  Where no on-street parking exists along Transit-Oriented Street frontages, the town may allow up to one (1) double loaded corridor in front of buildings designed for retail and entertainment uses if cross-access to other front-yard parking facilities exists or will be provided, such that the parking connections will allow for continuous circulation without utilizing the street. The required pedestrian zone and build-to-line shall be established at the back edge of the parking facility as if it were the frontage line. Intent: parking in front of a retail-type uses is a proven necessity for the success of such businesses. 
(13)  Off-site parking facilities are permitted within the RAC districts. If the off-site parking facility is more than one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) feet from the development site seeking to utilize the off-site spaces, transit service with a maximum fifteen (15) minute headway between the parking facility and development site must exist or be planned with committed funding within five (5) years of issuance of a building permit for the development site. The owner of the off-site parking facility shall enter into written arrangement with the town, whereby the land providing the parking area shall never be sold or disposed of except in conjunction with the sale of the building the parking area serves so long as the off-site parking facilities are required. Said agreement shall be recorded at the expense of the owner and shall run with the land to bind the heirs, successors and assigns of said owner. Said written agreement may be voided by the town administrator if other provisions are made for off-street parking facilities. 
(14)  The availability of on-street parking spaces shall reduce the off-street parking requirement of uses on an abutting lot. Each on-street parking space abutting a lot for at least fifty (50) percent of its length shall reduce the off-street parking requirement on such lot by one (1) space. 
(F)  Bicycle Parking Requirements. Secure and convenient off-street bicycle parking facilities shall be provided as follows at no cost to users. All bicycle parking facilities shall be provided on private property in a highly visible location to intended users, protected from sun and rain by a roof, canopy or other approved cover, and situated to maximize the Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) principle of natural surveillance. Bicycle racks and bicycle lockers are approved for use. 
(1)  Office and institutional: One (1) space per forty (40) required parking spaces (at maximum requirement, before reductions) or fraction thereof. 
(2)  Residential multi-family: One (1) space per three (3) units. 
(3)  Retail, service, entertainment: 
(a)  For the first four hundred fifty (450) required parking spaces, one (1) bicycle space per fifteen (15) required automobile parking spaces or fraction thereof. 
(b)  For all additional required parking spaces above four hundred fifty (450), one (1) bicycle space per fifty (50) required parking spaces or fraction thereof. 
(4)  Mixed-use: Add the requirements of the separate uses. 
(G)  Automobile Parking Requirements. 
(1)  Parking space dimensions. Every standard off-street parking space shall be at least nine (9) feet in width and eighteen (18) feet in length. Compact parking spaces are subject to the dimensional requirements and quantity limitations of Article VII. 
(2)  Fee for parking. Nothing herein shall require that all off-street parking be provided free of charge. 
(H)  Parking reductions. The standard parking requirement may be reduced by the amounts indicated in the following table. The table shows the cumulative parking reduction that is permissible with any combination of reductions.

(1)  Reduction for bicycle parking and lockers. Equal to one-half (0.5) of the ratio of required bicycle spaces provided with bike lockers divided by required auto parking spaces but not exceeding ten (10) percent of required parking. 
(2)  Reduction for bicycle parking, lockers, changing and shower facilities equal to the ratio of required bicycle spaces divided by required auto parking spaces, not exceeding ten (10) percent of required parking. Separate men's and women's facilities shall be provided in the amount of one (1) enclosed shower stall and thirty (30) square feet of changing area for every ten (10) required bicycle spaces. 
(3)  Reduction for Transit-Oriented Development of five (5) percent anticipated by modal split. 
(4)  Reduction for workforce housing units. A reduction shall be applied based upon data correlating car ownership with income level or housing cost. 
(5)  Reduction for provision of a greenway of five (5) percent allowed for provision of a greenway that connects all parts of a development twenty (20) acres or larger to a primary street cannot be combined with a T.O.D. reduction. Greenway's should feature at least one (1) pedestrian plaza with some combination of fountains, a gazebo, benches, landscaping, and/or other pedestrian draws. 
(6)  Reduction for "park-once synergy of uses." This is a grouping of like businesses that locate together to take advantage of the economies of scale, such as home furnishing, antiques and accessories stores that benefit from comparison shopping for specialized, often substantial items. Required parking for such uses shall be provided in the amount of the full parking requirement of the largest establishment of the grouping. No other reductions shall apply in unison with this parking formula. 
(7)  Substitution of motorcycle/scooter parking spaces. One (1) of every fifty (50) automobile parking spaces may be substituted with a designated motorcycle/scooter space clearly demarcated by striping and/or curbing and signage. For example; a development requiring one hundred (100) parking spaces could substitute two (2) automobile parking spaces for motorcycle/scooter spaces. A motorcycle space shall be no smaller than three (3) feet by seven (7) feet. 
(8)  Off-street parking along the street frontage of a lot shall count towards the parking requirement. 
(I)  Shared parking. 
(1)  Intent. The intent of shared parking is to permit a reduction in the total number of required parking spaces when a parcel is occupied by two (2) or more uses which typically do not experience peak parking demands. At the same time, providing the area where the sharing occurs is not heavily impacted by a parking shortage and provided that a shared parking agreement between property owners is recorded in the public records subsequent to town approval of the same. The developer or property owner is responsible for providing a copy of the recorded shared parking agreement to the town prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(2)  Shared parking calculations. The reductions for mixed-use developments are based upon shared parking calculations provided in Table 12-438.17(I), below. Instructions for use of the shared parking calculations follow this table.

* When a grouping of at least fifteen thousand (15,000) s.f. of restaurants is located proximate to at least fifty thousand (50,000) s.f. of entertainment use, the combined parking requirement for the uses shall be reduced by ten (10) percent. The restaurant uses shall be considered proximate to the entertainment uses if within a one-quarter mile walking distance via a continuous sidewalk. 
(3)  Procedure. When any land or building is used for two (2) or more uses, the minimum total number of required parking spaces shall be determined by multiplying the minimum required parking for each individual use, excluding spaces reserved for use by specified individuals or classes of individuals, by the appropriate percentage listed in the table for each of the designated time periods. Add the resulting sum for each of the five (5) vertical columns of the table. The minimum parking requirement is the highest sum resulting from the foregoing calculation. 
(4)  Maximum reduction. The maximum reduction under this provision shall be twenty-five (25) percent, excluding any reductions achieved through numbers one (1) through six (6), above.

Sec. 12-438.18. - General open space principles and requirements. 
(A)  Intent. Open space is not only a physical space but serves dually as functional linkages between neighborhoods/districts. It is recommended that open space is provided throughout the RAC within five (5) minute walking distances. Open space as part of all new developments is integral to livability within RAC districts. Open space encourages outdoor activity and life outside developments, which in turn creates a safer environment. Open space in conjunction with new developments should be located and designed to meet the needs of residents, businesses, and other users; to ensure a proper pedestrian scale; and in some cases to provide pervious area to serve the town in handling storm water drainage. 
(B)  Principles. To increase usable/attractive open space within the RAC that benefits both the public and private developers the following principals are suggested: 
(1)  Design public and private development projects to include usable, common open space consistent with one (1) or more open space typologies discussed in this section (i.e. plaza, paseo, courtyard, pocket park, etc.). This common space may assume a variety of different forms of site design solutions, but all common open space shall be integrated into the overall design of the new development and should easily connect to surrounding buildings and other pedestrian connection routes (and where possible, to adjacent open space networks). 
(2)  Reclaim all underutilized town-owned land within the RAC districts and create a plan for revitalizing these spaces so that they are no longer in deterioration. 
(3)  Encourage development of all open water sites with waterfront park features so that the area is dually serving the community in function and aesthetics. 
(4)  Encourage all new parks to be cutting edge public spaces that will spark community pride. 
(5)  Provide streetscape improvements (existing and future streets) that have a strong commitment to the pedestrian - comfortable walking, shaded seating, attractive pedestrian-scale features; ultimately serving the RAC as common open space connections. 
(C)  Open space and open space types defined. 
(1)  The following areas shall be considered as part of the required open space, both individually and in combination: landscaped areas; public sidewalks ten (10) feet in width or greater; plazas, courtyards, paseos and other open space types defined herein; outdoor dining and landscaping within any of the above; and, water features may count for up to twenty (20) percent of required open space. As an incentive, the percentage of water that may count towards required open space shall be increased to thirty-five (35) percent upon the provision of a waterfront park or promenade at least five hundred (500) feet in length and thirty (30) feet in width. 
(2)  Open spaces that do not conform to a defined open space type in section 12-438.19 (ex: required buffers, lawn areas, water bodies without a pedestrian promenade or other recreation component) shall not be considered common open space. 
(3)  This provisions shall control to the extent of conflict with open space requirements in Chapter 12. 
(4)  Characteristics of each open space type defined in section 12-438.19 below, that are not mandatory, shall qualify for the open space incentives of Table 12-438.9(F), "Schedule of incentives." 
(D)  Requirements. 
(1)  Open space shall be provided in the amount required in Table 12-438.9(E), subject to reduction through incentives for affordable housing, green buildings, etc. Provision of all or some of the required open space as common open space is also encouraged through incentives. 
(2)  Ensure existing parks and town common spaces are provided with adequate pedestrian connection to surrounding primary street corridors. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.518), 12-5-12)

Sec. 12-438.19. - Types of open spaces; principles and minimum standards. 
    Besides traditional "park space" it is important that other types of spaces be developed, for example: small urban plazas; the upgrade of alleys to pedestrian paseos; and dedicated sections of sidewalks for social and recreational uses. Table 12-438.9(F) includes an incentive bonus for projects that contribute to the overall system of common open spaces. Types of open spaces that should occur throughout the RAC, and allowable locations, are identified in this section.

(B)  Pedestrian Streets. Include streets that will focus on ground floor retail and large amount of pedestrian activity. Transit-Oriented Streets are very important pedestrian streets. Pedestrian streets should have the widest sidewalks, streetscape elements, and ground floor uses that result in a comfortable and interesting pedestrian experience. Pedestrian sidewalks do not qualify for incentive credit. 
(1)  Characteristics and requirements. 
(a)  Developers may install sidewalk elements, such as commemorative plaques or artwork, as approved by the town, at the main entrance to buildings. 
(b)  The sidewalk paving pattern and materials should be continuous and flush.

(C)  Pocket Parks. Pocket parks can occur nestled in downtown Davie, on a college campus or amongst the largely residential Downtown Davie neighborhood districts (RAC-ND2 and 4). Ranging usually in size from one-half acre to an acre, pocket parks can offer relief from the hardscape of downtown or can be utilized as a community yard if set on the center of a square of residential units. Pocket parks are most successful when found directly off the beating path of a successful pedestrian street or with residential units "watching" the park. 
(1)  Characteristics and requirements. 
(a)  Pocket parks should abut streets and be physically and visually accessible from the public sidewalks. Adjacent development should be designed with natural surveillance considerations including building orientation and access to the park, and fenestration, in order to encourage pocket park use and ensure security. 
(b)  The pocket parks shall be accessible to the public for at least the time of normal business hours. 
(c)  The pocket park shall not consist of any hiding places. Special features, and medium size vegetation shall be implemented with this in mind. 
(d)  Pocket parks shall provide at least one (1) sitting place for each two hundred (200) square feet of pocket park. 
(e)  An even mix of sun and shade coverage is encouraged. 
(f)  A pocket park shall be exclusive of any vehicular access, loading and parking areas. 
(g)  Provide adequate security lighting. 
(h)  Plastic playground equipment is discouraged. 
(i)  A special feature, including but not limited to those listed in section 12-438.25(B) is required for incentive credit. 
(D)  Plazas. Plazas are large outdoor rooms that extend the public realm from the street or sidewalk to the main entry of an adjacent building. They enhance the pedestrian environment and will invigorate adjacent developments/districts within which they are located. 
(1)  Characteristics and requirements. 
(a)  Plazas should abut public areas and be physically and visually accessible from the public sidewalks. Security fences, walls, and entry gates should not block the sidewalk edge of the plaza or views into the plaza. 
(b)  The plaza shall be accessible to the public for at least the time of normal business hours. 
(c)  Entries to the plaza, business and storefronts within the plaza shall be designed and lighted so they are safe and visible to plaza guest, avoiding hiding places. 
(d)  Ground level facades discussed in section 12-438.24 (facades and frontage) shall be applied to facades facing a plaza. 
(e)  Plazas shall provide at least one (1) sitting place for each one hundred (100) square feet of plaza in addition to any permitted outdoor dining provided. 
(f)  Plazas should have adequate mix of sun vs. shaded area. No more than forty (40) percent of the plaza shall be covered with a roof. 
(g)  At least ten (10) percent of the plaza's surface shall be landscaped to provide heat relief. 
(h)  Vehicular access, loading, or parking within the plaza is prohibited. Emergency access drives will be considered through plaza upon review of integration into plaza design. 
(i)  Plazas shall be a minimum of two thousand, five hundred (2,500) square feet in areas. 
(j)  A special feature, including but not limited to those listed in section 12-438.25(B) is required for incentive credit. 
(E)  Courtyards/Outdoor Space. Located within the confines of building walls, sometimes between multiple developments. Many times courtyards are not directly visible or open to the street. They are smaller than plazas. The following principals are suggested when designing a courtyard: 
(1)  Characteristics and requirements. 
(a)  The courtyard shall be accessible to the public for at least the time of normal business hours. 
(b)  Courtyards should be physically accessible from the public sidewalks. 
(c)  Entries to the courtyard, business and storefronts within the courtyard shall be designed and lighted so they are safe and visible to courtyard guest, avoiding hiding places. 
(d)  Courtyards shall provide at least one (1) sitting place for each seventy-five (75) square feet of courtyard in addition to any permitted outdoor dining provided. 
(e)  Courtyards should have adequate mix of sun vs. shaded area, no more than fifty (50) percent of the courtyard should be covered with a roof. 
(f)  No vehicular access, loading, or parking is permitted. 
(g)  At least ten (10) percent of the courtyard surface shall be landscaped. Shade trees and gardens are strongly encouraged. 
(h)  A special feature, including but not limited to those listed in section 12-438.25(B) is required for incentive credit. 
(F)  Linear Waterfront Parks/Promenades. Existing canals and large tract water bodies dominate the landscape in many areas of the RAC districts. Improvements to the surrounding green space would increase walkability and property values of adjacent businesses and residents. The surrounding green space of these existing water bodies as well as future water bodies should be utilized as linear parks or promenades. Linear parks and promenades can be found within urban areas or in more suburban scenarios, connecting multiple businesses via an attractive pedestrian promenade. In South Florida, promenades and linear parks are often adjacent to water bodies. An incentives is provided for waterfront promenades, pursuant to section 12-438.18. 
(1)  Characteristics and requirements. 
(a)  Linear parks and promenades shall be physically accessible and clearly visible from adjacent street corridors and adjacent business entries. 
(b)  At least fifty (50) percent of the linear park and twenty (20) percent of the promenade surface shall be landscaped. Shade trees are strongly encouraged in either scenario Linear parks and promenades shall provide at least one (1) sitting place per one hundred (100) linear feet of park/promenade length in addition to any permitted outdoor dining that may be provided. 
(c)  Landscape and site lighting within the park/promenade shall not impede the flow of the pedestrians. 
(d)  No vehicular access, loading, or parking is permitted within the promenade. Emergency access drives will be considered along linear park or promenade upon review of integration into park/promenade design. 
(e)  Parks and promenades must consist of adequate lighting, and directional signage that is pedestrian-scaled. 
(G)  Recreation and Ball Fields. Existing as well as proposed recreation parks and ball fields are important to the overall success of the RAC districts, providing a location for organized sports that support university and residential needs. Recreation/ball fields are green spaces specifically used for organized sporting events and usually consist of but are not limited to these elements, multi-use fields, tennis courts, basketball courts, and bleacher/refreshment facilities. 
(1)  Characteristics and requirements. 
(a)  Recreation and ball fields shall be physically accessible from public sidewalks. 
(b)  Recreation and ball fields shall provide signage clearly stating field hours of operation. 
(c)  Recreation and ball fields shall not spill light pollution on surrounding residential uses. 
(d)  Gray water use is recommended for irrigation of fields. 
(e)  Field lights shall utilize cutoff fixtures adjacent to residential and mixed-uses. 
(f)  Security fencing shall be at a minimum black or dark green vinyl coated chain-link. Decorative aluminum fencing (powder coated black) is encouraged. 
(g)  Fields must provide adequate and attractive seating, signage, and lighting. 
(G)  Landmark/Town Park. Vibrant towns have a signature park highlighting and physically representing the ideals/face of the town. The RAC districts would benefit from a signature park that could have an icon element, interactive water features, educational component, passive, active areas, and space for outdoor events. 
(1)  Characteristics and requirements. 
(a)  Town park design should be state of the art, reflections of the community's past and suggestions to its future should be evident. Educational components should play an important role as well as a schedule of events that will draw people to the park. 
(b)  High quality site features and materials (pavement, lighting, seating, signage, etc.) are encouraged. 
(c)  The town park should be physically accessible from all surrounding public sidewalks, to ensure pedestrian access. 
(d)  The town park should abut a main public thoroughfare. 
(e)  Parking counts should be kept to a minimum; alternate forms of transportation to the park are encouraged. 
(f)  The town park shall be at least three (3) acres preferably six (6) acres. 
(g)  The park must have an adequate mix of landscape vs. hardscape. 
(h)  Only porous parking surface is permitted, only a maximum of five (5) percent of the square feet of the park can be devoted to surface parking. 
(i)  Drought resistant plants or use of gray water for irrigation is encouraged. 
(H)  Common Open Space Connections. Open space connections consist of public and private sidewalks and paseos. These connections are the key to the ensuring walkabilty of the community and the success of common open spaces. 
(1)  Sidewalks consist of two (2) types: sidewalks as part of a pedestrian street experience and independent sidewalks that traverse a site and connect separated developments. Comfortable sidewalks with attractive paving, generous landscape, shade trees, and attractive/functional lighting create a memorable experience for pedestrians walking throughout the RAC districts. The following principles should be reviewed when designing sidewalks: 
(2)  Characteristics and requirements. 
(a)  Sidewalks shall be comfortable and attractive. When possible, alternative paving materials and patterns are encouraged. 
(b)  Adequate seating and lighting should be integrated into sidewalk design. 
(c)  All independent sidewalks not adjacent to a street or falling under the streetscape sections shall be a minimum of six (6) feet. 
(I)  Paseos are narrow pedestrian passages that serve as a break in larger blocks or mid block access. Former service alleys are encouraged to be redeveloped into paseos as buildings are transformed. Paseos small sizes are perfect for retail development. Paseos are useful in warmer climates where their enclosure and relative shade make them an attractive alternative to street retail. 
(1)  Characteristics and requirements. 
(a)  Building wall heights framing a paseo should not be more than three (3) times the height of the paseo's width. 
(b)  Overhead structures; such as trellises or roof structures should not dominate any more than fifty (50) percent of the paseo length. 
(c)  Building facades facing the paseo shall reflect that of the required street frontage. 
(d)  Additional shade besides that cast from the building shall be individual umbrellas or overhead awnings/architectural fabric. 
(e)  Paseos should have direct visual connection from the street to their destination points. 
(f)  Seating and visual interest (sculpture, landscape, water features, etc.) are encouraged to ensure safety and usability of the paseo. 
(g)  Paseos shall not be more than thirty (30) feet nor less than ten (10) feet wide. 
(h)  No vehicular access, loading or parking is permitted. Emergency access drives will be considered through paseos upon review of integration into paseo design. 
(i)  Paseos should be accessible to the public for at least the time of normal business hours. 
(j)  Entries to the paseo business and storefronts shall be designed and lighted so they are safe and visible to paseo guests, avoiding hiding places. 
(k)  Landscape and lighting shall not impeded pedestrians circulation. 
(l)  Landscape should cover a minimum of ten (10) percent of the surface of the paseo.

(B)  Principles. 
(1)  Generally. Planting areas should be layered and dense to therefore create a continuous "sense of green." These planting areas will contribute immeasurably to the districts' visual pleasure, especially in the enjoyment of natural outdoor amenities. In addition to these, a consideration to preserve the natural materials should be given, as well as attempt to utilize indigenous materials when adding to the planting. The following guidelines offer both functional as well as aesthetic information. 
(2)  Ground Plane Materials. Shrub materials, in their wide variety of forms, colors, and textures, provide the basis for visual interest and spatial definition below eye level. When properly used, masses of shrub material can become the unifying element in the landscape, bringing diverse landscape elements into overall harmony. Through contrasting variations in form and texture, seasonal color displays, ground plane materials also contribute much to the variety and interest of the landscape. 
(3)  Upper Story Materials. Upper story materials will provide aesthetic and functional value to the district. These plant materials will provide canopies, soften or enhance architectural elements.

(4)  Vines and Groundcovers. Vining plants are often used to climb walls, providing both textural relief and shade for the surface. Trained on trellises, they give supplemental shade and color interest. Groundcover plants form low, spreading mats, which require little maintenance and effectively stabilized banks and slopes from wind or water erosion.

(5)  Accent Materials. Plants, which singly or in small groups provide a distinctive display because of their outstanding flowering, seasonal color, interesting form, or habit of branching, should be used as specimens or accents in the landscape. Careful placement of accent plants will provide strong points of focal interest within the overall planting scheme.

(6)  Shading and Cooling. A critical need of all public sites will be the provision of shade and relief from the summer heat especially in open areas of high pedestrian usage. Maximum impact of the sun will usually occur to the west and southwest of tall structures. Tree materials are excellent shade producing elements, but different tree types are useful in different circumstances. 
Trees with large leaves and a dense canopy produce heavy shade under their crown. 
Single trees will provide 'islands' of shade, while groups of trees, spaced either formally or informally at intervals, can form a "bosque" effect which can make large areas useful for daytime activities. 
Since consistent shade may hinder growth of other plants beneath such trees, it is recommended that bosques only occur in predominately paved areas, or else care is taken to under plant with shade tolerant species. 
While shrubs and ground cover do not produce shade directly useful to humans, they are highly beneficial in reducing ground temperatures and evaporation from the soil, and in moderating reflection and glare. 
In the design of areas for maximum daily use, the dynamics of solar movement must be understood so that trees may be located for maximum shade advantage. Sun angles and altitudes determine the best location for trees in relation to use areas. 
Whenever public spaces adjoin private development, the shade provided by buildings should be utilized. Beyond the building shadow, however, canopy trees can effectively extend the total amount of comfortable surface area available. Smaller, less formal areas, such as tot lots, may require only intermediate sized trees due to the reduced scale of the space. Small, intimate spaces such as unit terraces may be successfully shaded with a single small tree.

(7)  Screening. A second consideration in the use of plant materials relates to their adaptability in the screening of use areas and to protect and enhance project elements. Dense planting along streets and drives can soften vehicle noise as well as aid in the filtration of dust from the air. All levels of planting contribute to the screening of streets and parking areas. Proper placement of under story plant materials can eliminate headlight glare from approaching vehicles. 
Planting can be introduced to take advantage of cooling breezes as well as to mitigate the effects of major winds considered undesirable project elements. Proper species selection and plant placement can funnel breezes to desired areas. Plant materials are highly useful in the visual screening of unsightly views such as exposed utilities, storage areas, loading areas, or parking lots. Efforts should be made to identify areas, which are potentially distractive to the visual environment, and employ screening with plant materials. 
Through deliberate placement, plant materials (especially trees) can direct a person's view to an important area. In the same way, planting can enclose a view. When planting along public streets, consider the door swing of vehicle, stopped at the curb. Avoid situations where plant materials will interfere with easy door opening or ingress/egress of the driver. If there is a conflict, the plant materials will eventually become damaged. 
SCREENING Coccooloba uvifera Sea Grape Eugenia foetida Spanish Stopper Ficus rubiginosa Rusty Fig Podocarpus macrophyllus Podocarpus  
Treatment of the area below a tree should consider the variety and the amount of area surrounding the tree. Heavily used areas should use a tree grate. Softer materials can be used in less intense situations. 
Nearly every vehicle has an overhang. It is necessary to remember this when landscaping around streets, parking lots, etc. The overhang can occur at either end of the vehicle. Often, oil can drip from the vehicles. This can damage plant materials placed to close to the vehicles. 
(8)  Design Simplicity. A natural plant association may contain thousands of plants, and these may have many diverse forms and space relations. Nevertheless, there exists even in nature the strict unity of one (1) governing element that links the parts. In any plant composition there should be a predominance of material, color, or texture to give needed unity. Accent material should then be introduced to play against the dominant material creating the needed contrast. A complicated planting scheme, except in unique situations, is seldom as successful as simple masses, with a predominant species to provide unity and a few individual accent plants. 
These principles apply to all scales of development, with masses and accents occurring in greater size and number, but retaining the same proportional philosophical approach. Simplicity and strength should describe the RAC development district planting. Plant material should be clustered to create a feeling of mass. At the same time, there needs to be enough variety of plant material to suggest richness. 
Equal attention needs to be paid to the ground plane. Ground cover plants need to be selected with as much care as trees and shrubs. Careful selection of groundcovers can add exciting colors and textures to the ground plane. Whenever possible, use ground covers in lieu of grass. Once established, ground covers will require less constant maintenance. 
(9)  Color. The use of blooming plants will be a major objective of all areas of the RAC development district. It should be an aesthetic goal of all public sector development to utilize flowering material throughout RAC development district. The use of perennial plants to anchor planting massing and annual blooming plants should provide a rotation of seasonal color. 
Permanently planted materials should occur in large bold masses of unified color, with consideration given to their textural scale and compatibility with adjacent materials during periods when they are not in bloom. The use of temporary, blooming plants can be accomplished through both in ground and container grown plant material. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2010-020, § 2(Exh. A), 9-7-10; Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.521), 12-5-12; Ord. No. 2014-12, § 2(Exh. A), 12-2-14) 
Sec. 12-438.22. - Site plan procedures. 
    Applications for site plans shall be governed by the requirements of Article XII. 
(A)  Prospective applicants for site plan approval are encouraged to submit for conceptual approval prior to finalizing and submitting a formal site plan application. Conceptual approval offers the developer an immediate opportunity to obtain feedback from the town's planning professionals and town council as to the project design, architecture, application for incentive bonuses, and if necessary, design variations (see 12-438.23 below). The conceptual approval process, submittal requirements, application fee, and schedules shall be established administratively. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.522), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-438.23. - Variations in design; administrative relief. 
(A)  Intent and purpose. The RAC districts differ from many other zoning districts within the town because of its emphasis on design principles, and because it seeks to combine different use types within buildings and development sites rather than separate them, and to encourage an urban intensity of development and form. 
    In order to accomplish this, several areas of the RAC districts have specific, prescribed development standards rather than minimums and maximums, to define the urban form of future development. Given this level of specificity throughout an area as large in breadth as the RAC districts, requests for variation from the standards and requirements can occasionally be expected in order to account for the variation in conditions within the RAC districts, and the difficulty of accounting for them in a design-specific regulation. Requests for variation can also be expected to facilitate design interpretations and alternatives that work as well, or better, than the prescribed standard. Finally, some aspects of site development and design have not been prescribed or because the sheer size and variation of conditions and objectives within the RAC districts made this prohibitive. In some such cases, the intent of the regulations may be executed with slight variation based on the specifics of the site, adjacent street and uses, and development proposal. 
    For all of these reasons, the variance process of section 12-309 has been supplanted by a design-based variation process that shifts the focus of review from hardship to design and logistics issues. However, variances still apply to code provisions not specific to the RAC districts, and to the intensity standards of the RAC districts. 
(B)  Procedure. 
(1)  The town council is authorized to approve variations to the standards and requirements of this Division, provided that variations from the intensity standards of this Division are subject to the variance process. 
(2)  Design variations associated with site plan and site plan modifications shall be considered as part of such site plan or modification applications. 
(3)  Submittal requirements shall be established administratively. 
(4)  The town council shall evaluate each request for design variation based upon the criteria set forth in this section, and may approve, approve with conditions, or deny such request after conducting an advertised, quasi-judicial public hearing pursuant to the requirements applicable to site plan approval. 
(C)  Standard of review for design variations. The town use the following criteria to base decisions to approve, approve with conditions, or deny requests for design variation: 
(1)  Whether the request is for a reasonable accommodation of design flexibility that results in overall superior development and design consistent with the intent and principles of this Division that govern the standard for which variation is requested; or, 
(2)  Whether the variation is appropriate to accommodate site conditions not anticipated in these regulations, or to reconcile conflicting requirements, provided the request is generally consistent with the intent and principles of the this Division that govern the standard for which variation is requested. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.523), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-438.24. - Building design guidelines. 
    For areas designated Western Theme Overlay District, this section shall be superseded by the Western Theme Development Manual. 
(A)  Architectural Articulation. Architectural articulation describes the treatment of facades and building massing that ultimately form a significant part of the individual buildings "expression" and by extension the quality of the built environment overall. 
(1)  Principles. 
(a)  Increased articulation at ground level and at levels where people interact directly with the building promotes a more "human scale". 
(b)  Increased articulation at primary facades (those on major thoroughfares) is appropriate to provide a sense of hierarchy in the visual environment. 
(c)  Individual buildings can have varied approaches to architectural articulation with respect to each other but should have a consistent approach within a single building in terms of proportion, limited material mix, etc. 
(d)  Articulation should generally be arranged so to emphasize the vertical over the horizontal in proportion. 
(B)  Architectural Landmarks. Architectural landmarks are significant buildings that help anchor important public spaces. They help create hierarchy within the built environment with respect to the open spaces that they define and create common points of focus and reference within the built environment. 
(1)  Principles. 
(a)  Architectural landmarks should be located in prominent locations and at the end of important vistas as they become reference points and anchors. 
(b)  Architectural landmarks should have a building program that speaks to the community as a whole and is used by the broader public. 
(c)  Architectural landmarks should have programs with frequent use and large numbers of people; they naturally become focuses of energy within a city. 
(d)  Traditionally, architectural landmarks have been city halls, post offices, religious facilities, theaters, and museums. 
(e)  Private buildings can be considered for architectural landmark status based on the nature and quantity of use, a significant campus building for instance would be an appropriate example. 
(f)  An approved landmark building is encouraged to create a unique architectural expression to help it stand out within the built context. 
(g)  The landscape and/or plaza space in front and around an architectural landmark should also be of higher quality, unique and take into consideration the larger space or sequence of spaces that it is anchoring. 
(h)  Architectural landmarks typically are articulated with more monumental or larger scale architectural elements, designed again to give prominence. 
(i)  Architectural landmark buildings are encouraged to be in use for during as many different parts of the day and night as possible, gathering and activity are recommended. 
(2)  Requirements. 
(a)  A building program must be reviewed for confirmation of architectural landmark status by virtue of proposed position in Master Plan, use and quality of proposed building. 
(b)  An approved landmark building should be given special consideration with respect to the zoning requirement that apply to typical buildings. Such allowances would be as follows: 
1.  Additional height (if warranted, not typical of landmarks) 
2.  Additional density 
3.  Reduced setbacks 
4.  Increased design flexibility (styles and materials that might otherwise be considered based on the quality of design) 
(C)  Fenestration. Fenestration refers to the building openings, windows, etc. that provide natural light to the interior of the built environment and also form a significant part of a buildings architectural expression. The treatment of the fenestration is critical in both defining visually the built form of buildings, managing and providing natural light to the interior of spaces and effecting energy use as a product of heat gain by the sun. 
(1)  Principles. 
(a)  There should be an orderly relationship among windows, doors, porches, and roof forms. 
(b)  Windows and openings should tend to be vertical in proportion. 
(c)  Areas with large glazed surfaces should have additional articulation to both provide sufficient architectural detail to create a "human scale" and to provide shading on the heat gain intensive sides of buildings. 
(d)  Clear glazing with Low E coatings (for heat gain) are strongly preferred to reflective surfaces. The life of the inside of the building should be visible from the exterior wherever possible. 
(e)  Fenestration/louvers at parking structures where exposed to side streets should be proportioned similar to the rest of the structure and be attractively treated. 
(f)  Articulation around windows/openings should be consistent and proportionate to the building expression as a whole so as to integrate the fenestration into the facade as a whole. 
(2)  Requirements. 
(a)  Windows will be required to be vertical in proportion and curtain wall areas will be required to affect a vertical proportion with the hierarchy of their members. 
(b)  Storefronts will require vertical members at no greater than eight (8) feet to zero (0) inch intervals to create sufficient articulation at ground level. 
(c)  Mirrored glazing or very dark shading glazing is prohibited along street frontages other than local street frontages within the RAC-RTW and RAC-RTE districts. 
(D)  Architectural Lighting. The treatment of architectural lighting is an important visual enhancement to the built environment, it also is part of the overall illumination system which relates to safety at night. 
(1)  Principles. 
(a)  Lighting can either be concealed and indirect or can be provided by well designed, quality fixtures that create enhancement to the architecture that they are attached to. 
(b)  Step lights and bollards at a walking level enhance safety and provide attractive lighting that does not create visual glare. 
(c)  Street lighting should be of an attractive and long lasting design that fits well into the overall design context and should have light apertures that focus the lighting on the street and away from buildings so as not to disrupt the residences. 
(d)  Minimum light levels must be met from a safety point of view but excessive lighting and energy waste must also be avoided. 
(e)  Natural light colors are preferred; high pressure sodium (orange) lighting is discouraged. 
(f)  Ballast noise/maintenance is also an important consideration. 
(2)  Requirements. 
(a)  All exterior steps and significant grade transitions must have light levels for safety per accepted industry standards. 
(b)  Exterior exit ways, parking lots and public areas around buildings must have sufficient light levels for safety per accepted industry standards. 
(c)  Lighting designs will be reviewed by the town from the standpoint of energy efficiency, color, quality, and aperture/spread. 
(d)  High pressure sodium lighting will be limited to service areas and areas with limited public impact only. 
(e)  All outdoor lighting fixtures shall be consistent with the night sky regulations found in section 12-262. 
(E)  Architectural Materials. Architectural materials are the visually exposed portions of the built environment. The long term quality and integrity of the materials and expression defines in the long term the built environment. 
(1)  Principles. 
(a)  Materials should be natural and authentic wherever possible where there is a high level of human contact with the building (notably at the ground level). 
(b)  Materials should be long lasting and consistent in their expression with limited maintenance, particular attention to durability is essential at the ground level due to high traffic/use. 
(c)  A range of materials and expressions are encouraged in the overall built environment, materials such as wood, stone, stucco, metal, etc. 
(d)  It is expected that the materials used are consistent with the building expression. 
(e)  In order to create an authentic mixed use environment as a whole, emphasis at the ground level is on the time honored materials and building traditions thus further promoting the "human scale". 
(f)  Simulated materials are acceptable if used in locations where they are not in direct contact with people and have qualities that do not make them stand out as obviously "fake". 
(g)  Where simulated materials are used (e.g. vinyl siding to simulate wood siding), materials with simpler details that look most convincing will be preferred. 
(h)  Brick and stone veneers will be judged by both their finishes and the treatment at the corners, full corner pieces should be used to conceal thin-ness of veneer treatment. Veneers over massed volumes vs. single surfaces will also be preferred. 
(Ord. of 2-6-08, § 1(Exh. A); Ord. No. 2009-6, § 4, 2-4-09; Ord. No. 2010-021, § 8, 9-7-10; Ord. No. 2012-28, § 2(Exh. A)(§ 12-32.524), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 12-438.25. - Additional design guidelines. 
(A)  Site furnishings. Site furnishings play an important role in the overall visual quality and identity throughout the RAC districts. Careful consideration must be given to the selection of the site furnishings such as benches, trash receptacles, drinking fountains, bicycle racks, etc. Site furnishings should be accessible and usable by the handicap whenever possible. Furnishing should be compatible with their surroundings, and should maintain unity throughout the RAC districts. 
    Materials for site furnishings should be chosen for maximum strength, durability, and should require as little maintenance as possible. Surface finishes should weather and age gracefully. Accents in the form of hardware, etc. may require additional maintenance beyond the recommended minimum. Recommended materials include: 
 Cultural and/or artistic metals 
 Aluminum/cast aluminum 
 Stainless steel 
 Concrete 
 Granite 
 Keystone 
 Specialty hardwoods 
 Cast iron, finished with an epoxy based paint capable of resisting the elements of South Florida. 
(1)  Bike Racks. Bike racks will provide a safe and secure place for residents and visitors to lock bicycles and participate in civic activities. The placement of bicycle racks will also invite residents and visitors to interact within the district recreationally. A variety of bicycle rack designs is encouraged. Such racks may be architecturally treated as significant items or minimized relative to their visual impact. Bike racks may be integrated with light standards or with other site elements to reduce their visual impact. 
(2)  Bollards. Bollards should be designed and implemented to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. They should be used to discourage vehicular intrusion into a pedestrian area. 
Bollard design should relate to adjacent architectural or streetscape elements. The design of the bollards should reflect or enhance the theming of the district. All bollards should be harmonious with the other site furnishings. The incorporation of lighting into the bollard design is encouraged in special applications for emphasis and where vandalism is not considered a problem. 
(3)  Flagpoles/Banners. Flagpoles and banners present opportunities for the inclusion of color, pattern, and movement in the district. They can be used both as temporary signage and as a seasonal display. Banners may include many items of various shapes such as windsocks and flags. They can be hung from walls, light fixtures, or any other structural element of sufficient strength. 
(4)  Seating. Seating is used for social interaction; people watching, waiting, and resting. Seating should occur in heavily used public areas and along main pedestrian corridors. Benches should be located in shaded areas as well as in open areas where a high volume of people could congregate. In locations where longer stays are anticipated, benches with backs should be used. Backless benches should be provided for shorter stays. Special care should be taken to locate and select benches that discourage overnight sleeping by vagrants. 
Special measures should be taken to ensure that the selection of benches will be ones that are comfortable year round and are not affected by the exposure to intense sun. It should be noted, that seat walls provide other opportunities for seating. Seat walls could be implemented at grade changes, separate spaces, and be decorative in nature. 
(5)  Tree Grates. Tree grates are used to expand the walkable surface of the pedestrian corridor, while adding canopy tree shade to the pedestrian environment. The tree grates need to have barrier free access for wheelchairs and carriages to carefully travel over them. Tree grates should be compatible with the character of the surrounding area. 
(6)  Planters. As special site elements, planters and flowerpots can visually enhance a space and provide areas for landscape relief, as well as reduce or accent an architectural mass. Planters should be designed very carefully in consideration of the plants to be used. Pots can be used singly or in a mass to accentuate a space with color and visual interest. 
(7)  Trash Receptacles. Trash receptacles shall be incorporated within a consistent system of color, materials, and style. They shall compliment other furnishings and help unify the image of the RAC university mixed-use district. The major consideration when providing trash receptacles is their location. Receptacles are to be sited only where they will be both accessible and used. They should be placed along major pedestrian corridors, but shall not impede on pedestrian traffic. They should also be located at portals, pedestrian nodes, intersections, and seating areas. 
Trash receptacles shall be sited carefully to not obstruct views and to not transmit unpleasant odors. Trash receptacles must be waterproof and should contain a lid. Each receptacle shall have a sturdy removable liner for easy maintenance and be sized to accept standard trash bags. Maintenance vehicles shall have reasonable access on the promenade to the trash receptacles. 
(B)  Special Features. 
(1)  Fountains. Fountains can be utilized as major elements in enhancing the image of the RAC districts. Water in the fountains may be used in a variety of ways. The movement of water can create excitement and life in the environment. Its sound can be used to drown out undesirable noises. The design of fountains should take in to consideration the safety of plaza participants, especially if the fountain is interactive. The type of fountain spray should respond to the amount of wind action through the plaza area. Wind regulators should be used to minimize water spray on users and adjacent paving. Fountains should be designed using state of the art, cost efficient equipment and finishes, which will require minimal maintenance. The color and materials used in and around fountains should be compatible with other streetscape and plaza elements. Fountains can be used as focal points in major plazas or as entry features. Table 12-438.9(F) provides incentive credit for enhanced open space features such as fountains, in conjunction with the open space standards of section 12-438.19, "Types of open spaces; principles and minimum standards." 
(2)  Public Art. Art in the urban landscape is perhaps the most intense form of design. Beyond visual and hopefully, spiritual inspiration, it reflects the attitude and character of the community towards culture. There are several notable programs to bring art into the city beyond individual homes or businesses. They include Chicago Public Art Program, Kansas City, and Broward County "Art in Public Places". 
A public fine arts collection is encouraged throughout the newly developed areas. The idea of creating a space and featuring areas for public art differentiate this District as a community dedicated to the enjoyment of fine art. As mentioned before these types of programs have been established across the country in more that two hundred (200) states, counties, and municipalities. The object of these programs is to present fine art, as opposed to contextual art, for public places. It may include sculpture, mosaics, frescoes, etc. Its location may be permanent or temporary/mobile. In the display of fine art in public spaces, the area exhibits its ability to appreciate new ways of seeing life, its cultural pride, and its unique image. 
(C)  Public Sector Signage and Graphics. 
(1)  Intent and Purpose. Signage and graphics will affect the overall character of the RAC districts. In addition to serving the functional purpose of informing and directing pedestrian/vehicular traffic, well-designed signs establish a visual identity for an area. To be truly effective, all signs must contribute to the cohesiveness of a project. With this in mind, it is imperative that the design quality of public sector signs be in the highest of quality. The visual appearance of public signs will set the standard for private developers to follow. Before considering the design of public sector signs, it is necessary to fully understand who will be needing signs and why. The RAC districts will be serving a broad spectrum of people ranging from tourists, visitors, and shoppers, to residents. Some will be walking or riding a bicycle, while others driving vehicles. Public and private sign design must relate to all of these various users. 
In light of the broad range of public users, the design of signs and graphics needs to be flexible. It is essential that the sign design have the ability to expand and serve new areas within the public sector. The development of the RAC development district will undoubtedly require several years. The graphic design of the signs must be a high quality, must be timeless, and must tie into the theme of the RAC districts. 
Design and selection of materials for the sign idea and sign standard must be readily available over a period of several years. Requests for additional public signs will be made even after the completion of the final project phase. Signs must be reproducible without undue costs. The ease of replacing damaged signs must also be considered. 
The size of signs should vary depending on how they are viewed, i.e., their size should be considerably larger if they are seen from a moving auto as opposed to a pedestrian on foot. The introduction of a larger than necessary sign within the context of a pedestrian area can, negate its original purpose. Within pedestrian areas, signs, which are located at an excessive height, will be relatively ineffective. 
Many styles of standards can be selected for freestanding public signs. Each standard has a slightly different visual appearance. Standards can be complicated or simple. The final selection of a standard design should in part be determined by its adaptability to the various types of signs needed in the project. 
(2)  Applicability. 
(a)  Directional. To emphasize the character of the RAC districts and the cohesiveness of its various components, a series of signs directing vehicles and pedestrians throughout the area is recommended. Since a directional sign usually includes a list of nearby functions and businesses it serves as a directory of what can be found. The hierarchy of information on directional signs should be as follows: 
 Major public action nodes 
 Major public attractions 
 Major commercial attractions 
 Individual businesses 
There are two (2) types of directional signs; motor vehicles and pedestrians/cyclists. In many cases, messages for both groups will be combined. Only in areas where the pedestrians are far removed from vehicular traffic are separate signs necessary. 
(b)  Informational. This type of signage will provide important information, within the RAC districts, to identify focal areas including, but are not limited to; transit stops, public plaza entrances, and other focal areas. Informational kiosks should be located near busy site elements and may display a variety of temporary civic local information for the resident or visitor. Informational signage could also include street identification signs, therefore having a consistent street identification standard. 
(c)  Regulatory. Regulatory signage within the RAC districts will be used to define emergency access, service vehicle areas, bicycle only paths, handicapped areas, etc. It is meant to define specific points that are limited to overall use. 
(d)  Entry/gateway. Entry/gateway statement pertains to vehicular traffic and involves large-scale elements. Their purpose is to designate the point of transition from one (1) area to another which, in this case, is to designate The RAC districts from the outside and to announce major destinations within the districts. Elements that should be incorporated into the entry statement include: 
 Special paving 
 Masses of plant material 
 Focal elements 
 Special lighting 
 Banners 
 Signage 
 Water Features 
(D)  Lighting. A well-coordinated lighting system is an effective means of establishing a sense of security and unity throughout the RAC districts. Although the primary function of site lighting is to provide nighttime orientation and security, light fixtures become a very visible site element and are essential elements in creating the image of the RAC districts. Therefore, careful consideration should be taken not only to technically efficient systems but also to visually acceptable fixtures and standards. Lighting should only be directed at the selected element, over flow of light must not exist. All outdoor lighting fixtures shall be consistent with the night sky regulations found in section 12-262. 
(1)  Scale, Proportion, and Hierarchy. Consideration should be taken to the proper relation between the scale of a fixture and the scale of the area in which it will be implemented. In general, the larger the scale of the use, the higher the mounting light. The size of the fixture should also be in proportion to the height of its pole to avoid awkward proportions. Different uses require varying types of lighting. This section deals with the different types and scale of fixtures as well as light levels (footcandles) and light sources acceptable for each anticipated use. (See section 12-437.15 for all lighting requirements.) 
(2)  Light Levels. The following minimum average maintained footcandle levels shall be provided for the RAC districts: 
Approach roadways 1.0 FC Side streets 0.8 FC Parking Lots 1.0 FC Promenades 1.0 FC Sidewalks 0.6 FC Landscape lighting (varies)  
(3)  Light Source. Several different light sources are available for site lighting, with characteristic advantages and disadvantages to each. The following general guidelines are included for selection of an appropriate light source. 
(a)  High Pressure Sodium. Because of high efficiency and long lamp life, high-pressure sodium should be the predominant light source throughout the RAC districts. It should be used on all streets and parking lots. Because of its somewhat poor color rendition qualities, however, it should be avoided or supplemented in areas of high pedestrian use. 
(b)  Metal Hallide. Although not as efficient as high-pressure sodium, metal halide is much more pleasant in high pedestrian areas because it illuminates with very true colors. It should be considered for larger scale "people gathering spaces" such as plazas and along people streets. 
(c)  Color Corrected Mercury Vapor. Mercury vapor is also a pleasant light source for pedestrian areas but it is less efficient than metal halide. It should be used only in low voltage situations where efficiency is not critical, or to accent landscape material because of its ability to emphasize green foliage. 
(d)  Incandescent. Incandescent light, while pleasant for people environments, is very inefficient and has a short lamp life. It should only be used in low-level pedestrian scale fixtures where special effects are necessary and where regular maintenance is possible such as building entries, small courtyards, etc. 
(4)  Light Location. Streetscape lighting (arterial and collector roads). Wherever possible, existing fixtures and poles illuminating the RAC districts should be retained, repaired, and or replaced to maintain the consistency and efficiency of the current street light system. As necessary, individual poles should be relocated to resolve conflicts with proposed streetscape elements and pedestrian flow. Where supplemental or future street lights are proposed they shall match the existing fixtures/poles. 
All poles shall be located a minimum of four (4) feet to zero (0) inches (4'-0") from the curb face and maintained plumb and secure. The placement of poles should not create undesirable obstructions in pedestrian ways. Light poles in high pedestrian traffic areas can be outfitted for specialty banners. 
(5)  Local Street (a.k.a. Side Street) Lighting. Wherever possible, existing fixtures and concrete poles illuminating side streets should be retained, repaired and replaced to maintain consistency with the current street lighting system. As necessary, individual concrete poles should be relocated to resolve conflicts with proposed streetscape elements and pedestrian flow. 
Fixtures along side streets shall be located approximately one hundred (100) feet on centers. All poles shall be located a minimum of four (4) feet to zero (0) inches (4'-0") from the curb face and maintained plumb and secure. The placement of poles should not create undesirable obstructions in pedestrian ways. Light poles on designated "people streets" shall be outfitted for specialty banners. 
(6)  Parking Lot Lighting. Lighting in off-street parking lots should be designed to allow safe and secure night use of these facilities. Wherever possible, existing poles illuminating parking lots should be retained and repaired with new fixtures added to provide a more efficient and consistent lighting system. 
Parking lot lights located interior to larger parking lots shall have a Type V (square) distribution to ensure maximum coverage and to be spaced approximately one hundred and twenty (+120) feet on centers. Parking lot lights located along the perimeter of parking lots shall have a Type III distribution to throw light towards the lot interior and minimize glare on adjacent facilities. These fixture/poles shall be spaced one hundred (+100) feet on centers. 
Lighting within parking areas must be closely coordinated with parking lot design. Poles should be located out of the way of vehicular and pedestrian circulation aisles and parking stalls. They should be located at regular spacing within the landscaped area of center or side islands and protected by curbs or wheel stops. 
(7)  Pedestrian Lighting. Pedestrian lighting of the RAC districts must serve a variety of functions. This lighting must establish a safe and secure atmosphere for nighttime use and provide a distinct ambiance, which differentiates pedestrian facilities from adjacent vehicular zones. The fixtures, poles and bollards must have a human scale and offer a visual appearance, which complements the other streetscape elements in creating a unique image for the area. 
(8)  Landscape Lighting. In many instances, appropriate light levels and pleasant accent effects may be achieved through the use of landscape lighting. Accent spotlight fixtures, directed upwards into tree or palm foliage, provide low intensity but often-dramatic illumination of nearby pedestrian areas. 
Whereas up lighting provides a more selective result, down lighting (with fixtures attached to free standing poles or neighboring buildings) is advantageous when more tha one (1) tree is to be lit or when a less concentrated effect is desired. Lighting trees is as much art as it is science. For this reason, it is impossible to give definitive guidelines regarding the quantity of illumination or exact placement of fixtures. However, desired effects usually require between one-half (0.5) and one (1) ambient footcandles, depending on design objectives, color of foliage, surrounding light levels, etc. 
When used, landscape accent lights should be unobtrusive in appearance and/or hidden from view. All landscape lighting should be placed where beams are directed away from pedestrians' viewpoint. Lights mounted directly in trees should be discouraged unless means of attaching the fixture and conduit are sensitively handled to protect the plant's health and assure a pleasing appearance. 
(9)  Materials. Light fixtures are available in many materials. Of these materials, cast aluminum or cast bronze provides maintenance, long life, and pleasing aesthetics. Fixture fittings of cast aluminum fixtures should be stainless steel. Poles and bollards for lighting should be aluminum, fiberglass, decorative concrete, or cast iron. These poles provide a thin profile and require little maintenance. Depending on location and thematic considerations, decorative poles may be chosen. Light poles in main public areas should aim to enhance the overall theme of the RAC districts as a unique cultural hub. 
(10)  Color and Finish. During daylight hours, lighting fixtures should blend into the landscape and coordinate with other site furnishings. The right color and finish of the lighting material will enhance the theme during daylight hours, therefore making it a 24-hour site detail. Finish should be baked-on powdered coatings that minimize maintenance.

Intent. These are issues that developers will need to consider in becoming LEED certified, but are also strongly encouraged to be considered without certification. These particular issues are addressed because they highlight the major issues that the town wishes to encourage through the use of incentives. 
(1)  Building Requirements. 
(a)  All Buildings in the RAC seeking LEED certification will be required to meet the prerequisites listed below. Incentives will be offered through the incorporation of Green Building Principals as developed by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC), Florida Green Building Council (FGBC) & Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). 
(b)  Green Building Incentive Program-Seven (7) main prerequisites: 
1.  Erosion and Sedimentation control. 
2.  Fundamental Building Systems Commissioning. 
3.  Minimum Energy Performance. 
4.  CFC (Chlorofluorocarbons a.k.a. "Freon") Reduction in HVAC & R (Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning & Refrigerant) Equipment. 
5.  Storage and Collection of Recyclables. 
6.  Minimum Indoor Air Quality Performance. 
7.  Environmental Tobacco Smoke Control. 
(c)  Amendments to the FGBC (Florida Green Building Council) and LEED requirements will be enforced at the time of site plan review. 
(2)  Reducing Urban Heat Islands (LEED Sustainable Site Credit 7). 
(a)  An urban heat island (UHI) is a metropolitan area which is significantly warmer than its surroundings. As population centers grow in size from village to town to city, they tend to have a corresponding increase in average temperature. Traditional dark non-reflective surfaces for parking lots, roofs, walkways and other surfaces absorb solar radiation and radiate it back to surrounding areas. The Environmental Protection Agency says: "On hot summer days, urban air can be between two (2) and ten (10) degrees Fahrenheit. 2-10°F [2-6°C] hotter than the surrounding countryside." This increases local HVAC equipment cooling energy consumption. This effect can be mitigated through the use of shading and the use of light colored materials that reflect the solar radiation. 
(b)  To achieve credit for reducing the Urban Heat Island: 
1.  Use Energy Star compliant roofing (highly reflective). 
2.  Use roofing with high emittance rating. 
3.  Install a "green" roof (vegetated) for at least fifty (50) percent of the roof area. 
(3)  Light Pollution (LEED Sustainable Site Credit 8). 
(a)  Light Pollution is light that has "escaped" the area intended for its use and instead lights an area that is better left undisturbed. Light pollution causes problems in reducing the visual access to the night sky, disturbing the nocturnal environments, and it causes substantial energy costs over the lifetime of a building that could be avoided. The town has the right to over-ride this for any needs of their own: wayfinding, signage, safety, security, etc. 
(b)  To achieve credit for reducing light pollution: 
1.  Eliminate all unshielded fixtures. 
2.  Minimize up lighting. 
3.  Utilize down lighting. 
4.  Employ a lighting professional to assess the projects lighting needs. 
5.  Light only areas that require it. 
(4)  Storm Water Management. 
(a)  The Davie RAC is part of a larger water management system called CBWCD (Central Broward Water Control District). Many property owners within the RAC live on property that is either adjacent to a community lake or one (1) of the district's secondary canals. While these lakes and canals can lend a pleasant appearance to neighboring property, it is important to remember that, first and foremost, they exist for the purposes of storm water storage and drainage. 
(b)  The goal of the Town of Davie is that new development will not disrupt any of the natural water flows but will increase on-site filtration and eliminate contaminants. To achieve this objective the town new developments to utilize the benefits of: 
1.  Pervious materials as a substitute to concrete and asphalt; pervious paving vs. impervious paving (LEED sustainable Site credit 6) 
 Pervious materials are able to absorb surface water rather than shedding the water. 
 Pervious materials are cooler for the reducing surface heat radiation. 
 Pervious materials reduce the need for curbs and gutters as drainage structures. 
2.  Aquascaping areas of water run-off 
 Serves to catch, trap, and filter pollutants within water runoff. 
 Aides in controlling erosion of water body banks and filter pollutants within water runoff areas. 
(5)  Potable Water Conservation. 
Importance of water...a community that can conserve water will be a positioned for adapting to the future. 
Water efficient landscapes 
Native plantings 
Buildings should employ the use of innovative wastewater technologies such as low flow fixtures and waterless fixtures where possible. Current codes do not allow for the use of greywater or blackwater systems. Lower water usage will result in lower water connection fees. 
(6)  Reduced Site Disturbance (LEED Sustainable Site Credit 5). 
The intent of this regulation is to conserve existing natural areas and restore damaged areas to provide habitat and promote biodiversity. 
The requirements for this regulation involve reducing the development footprint (defined as entire building footprint, access roads and parking) to exceed the local zoning's open space requirement for the site by twenty-five (25) percent. For areas with no local zoning requirements like the university campuses, designate open space area adjacent to the building that is equal to the development footprint. 
(7)  Alternative Energy. 
(8)  Alternative Transportation (LEED Sustainable Site Credit 4). 
A critical part of this plans long term success will be determined by how well new developments provide opportunity for people to use alternative modes of transportation. Proposed bus routes have been proposed in the RAC master Plan study. These routes are encouraged to create a park once philosophy for those visiting the RAC. We also to encourage pedestrian links to bus routes and bicycle racks to allow persons to utilize as many modes of transportation as possible.

Sec. 12-509. - Development standards-New antenna supporting structures. 
(A)  These standards shall apply to new antenna supporting structures: 
(1)  Approval criteria for new antenna-supporting structures: 
a.  Setbacks. 
1.  Any new antenna-supporting structures, equipment enclosures and ancillary structures shall meet the minimum setback requirements for the zoning district where they are located, except that where the minimum setback distance for an antenna supporting structure from any property line or public right-of-way is less than the height of the proposed antenna-supporting structure, the minimum setback distance shall be increased to equal the height of the proposed antenna supporting structure, unless the antenna-supporting structure has been constructed using "breakpoint" design technology, in which case the minimum setback distance shall be equal to one hundred ten (110) percent of the distance from the top of the structure to the "breakpoint" level of the structure, plus the minimum setback distance. For example, on a one hundred (100) foot tall monopole with a "breakpoint" at eighty (80) feet, the minimum setback distance would be twenty-two (22) feet (one hundred ten (110) percent) of twenty (20) feet, the distance from the top of the monopole to the "breakpoint", plus the minimum setback for that zoning district. However, in all instances, the minimum setback distance from the setback line of any residentially zoned property, with an inhabited residence or proposed residences, shall be at least two hundred (200) percent of the height of the entire proposed structure. Certification by a professional engineer licensed by the State of Florida of the "breakpoint" design and the design's fall radius must be provided together with the other information required herein from an applicant. 
2.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the structure is located in the FB or BP zoning district, the minimum setback shall be thirty-five (35) feet from the adjacent property line or public right-of-way, unless the adjacent use is residential in which case the provisions above shall apply. 
b.  Height. The overall height of any antenna-supporting structure shall not be greater than one hundred twenty (120) feet, or two hundred (200) feet for public antenna-supporting structures on town-owned property. Height for all purposes in this section shall mean the linear distance from the ground to the highest physical point on the wireless telecommunications facility (including any attached antennas). 
c.  Construction. New antenna-supporting structures, except for public antenna supporting structures on Town Owned property shall have a monopole type construction only, and shall not be guyed or have a lattice type construction. 
d.  Structural integrity. 
1.  The entire antenna-supporting structure and all appurtenances shall be designed pursuant to the wind speed design requirements of ASCE 7-95, including any subsequent modification to those specifications; and 
2.  The new antenna-supporting structure shall be designed to accommodate the maximum amount of wireless telecommunications equipment, including that of other wireless telecommunication service providers. The exact amount of potential additional equipment and/or collocated facilities to be accommodated shall be agreed upon during a pre-application conference and recorded in the letter of understanding resulting from the conference. In all cases, the minimum number of collocated facilities on a new antenna-supporting structure between eighty (80) and one hundred twenty (120) feet in height shall be three (3), and the minimum number of collocated facilities on a new antenna supporting structure between forty (40) and eighty (80) feet in height shall be two (2). 
e.  Lighting. New antenna-supporting structures shall be illuminated in accordance with FAA requirements to provide aircraft obstruction lighting, where required. Any lighting required by the FAA must be of the minimum intensity and number of flashes per minute (i.e. the longest duration between flashes) allowable by the FAA. No other structure lighting shall be permitted except that required by the FAA. 
f.  Collocation feasibility. 
1.  No antenna-supporting structure shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates that no existing wireless telecommunications facility can accommodate the applicant's proposed facility; or that use of such existing facilities would prohibit personal wireless services in the area of the town to be served by the proposed antenna-supporting structure. 
2.  Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing wireless telecommunications facility could accommodate the applicant's proposed facility may consist of any of the following: 
(i)  No existing wireless telecommunication facilities located within the geographic area meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
(ii)  Existing wireless telecommunication facilities are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements, and cannot be increased in height. 
(iii)  Existing wireless telecommunication facilities do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed wireless telecommunication facilities and related equipment, and the existing facility cannot be structurally improved. 
(iv)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing wireless telecommunication facilities unsuitable. 
g.  Color. New antenna-supporting structures shall maintain a galvanized gray finish or other contextually appropriate color as determined by the town administrator or designee, except as may otherwise be required by federal rules or regulations. 
h.  Radio frequency emissions. The radio frequency emissions shall comply with FCC standards for such emissions on an individual and cumulative basis with any adjacent facilities. The applicant shall certify that the proposed facility shall cause no harmful interference to the existing Town of Davie Public Safety Communications equipment. 
i.  Intensity requirements. 
1.  For the purposes of impact fee calculation, the floor area for a wireless telecommunications facility shall be considered as only the total square footage of all equipment enclosures, i.e. the entire fenced-in area. 
2.  The following shall be considered as development area and shall be required to meet the setbacks and open space ratio requirements for the zoning district and/or habitat where they are located: 
(i)  The area beneath all equipment enclosures. 
(ii)  The area of the antenna-supporting structure foundation at or above grade. 
(iii)  The area beneath ancillary structures. 
(iv)  The area inside the antenna-supporting structure framework. 
j.  Security. Applicants shall provide for a fence around the proposed facility that meets the requirements of Section 12-113 of these Codes.

(7)  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
(8)  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(9)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
(G)  Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
(1)  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this article or the required elevation standards; 
(2)  Determination by the town council of the Town of Davie that: 
(a)  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
(b)  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
(c)  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as twenty-rive dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

(1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on property values, urban blight, pornographic litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
(2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other certain uses, such as other sexually oriented businesses, and establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent a concentration of sexually oriented businesses and such uses. 
(3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the town has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. 
(4)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(5)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
(6)  Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. 
(7)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(8)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. 
(9)  The findings noted in paragraphs number (1) through (8) raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(10)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns and each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the town has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. 
(11)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the town. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(12)  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(13)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(14)  The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article. 
(15)  The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the town will be promoted by the enactment of this article.

All costs incurred in disconnecting the alarm system or audible alarm shall be the responsibility of the alarm user and must be paid within ten (10) days of notice of an invoice for the same from the appropriate town agency or its billing/collection contractor. 
(f)  Presumed fire-response false alarms. There is a presumption of a false alarm created when an alarm signal is investigated by any enforcement officer and there is no sign of a fire emergency, or there is no sign of a medical emergency. For the first presumed false alarm, the contractor shall give notice to the residential or commercial alarm user of the conditions and requirements of this section. This notice shall advise the alarm user that the alarm system has had a presumed false alarm and that the second false alarm in any twelve-month period for a commercial alarm user will result in the imposition of a fine; however, a residential alarm user shall be permitted a second false alarm within a twelve-month period without imposition of a fine; additionally, and upon said second occurrence, each alarm user shall be informed that any subsequent false alarm in any twelve-month period will result in an additional fine.

(h)  Presumed police-response false alarms. There is a presumption of a false alarm created when an alarm signal is investigated by an enforcement officer and there is no sign of an unauthorized attempted entry or crime in progress evident to the officer, or there is no sign of a medical emergency. For the first presumed false alarm, the contractor shall give notice to the alarm user of the condition and requirements of this section without being assessed a fine for either commercial or residential police-response alarm registrations.

(4)  To operate an alarm system without an appropriate building permit or alarm system registration as required. 
In the event that evidence of operation of an alarm system without a registration is an alarm signal, a violation of this section shall be presumed, and the enforcement officer need not present any additional evidence for the code enforcement special magistrate or other jurisdiction to conclude by the greater weight of evidence that a violation of the article occurred. In the event evidence of unauthorized alarm operation is a fact other than an alarm signal, the enforcement officer shall cite such fact and request the alleged violator to prove that the alarm system is disconnected. Absent proof of disconnection by the requested date, a violation of the article shall be presumed and the enforcement officer need not present any additional evidence of unauthorized alarm operation for the code enforcement special magistrate or other jurisdiction to find by the greater weight of evidence that a violation has occurred. 
(5)  Nonpayment of any penalty imposed herein for false alarms. In the event the code enforcement special magistrate or other jurisdiction determines that a false alarm was clearly the fault of an alarm business, such finding shall preclude a finding that the alarm user violated this section for such false alarm. 
(6)  For any alarm system not to meet the operating standards established in subsection (e) of this section, and for any alarm user not to pay the costs when due. 
(7)  To install, maintain, operate or use any telephone alarm device regulated or programmed to make connection with any telephone installed in any facility of any law enforcement or fire prevention office.

(k)  Enforcement of violations. Any violation of this section may be prosecuted before a code enforcement special magistrate or other appropriate court of competent jurisdiction. The enforcement officer may prosecute a series of alleged false alarm violations in one (1) notice of violation, provided each alleged false alarm is identified. The code enforcement special magistrate or other appropriate court of competent jurisdiction may impose a separate fine for each determined separate violation even though they were prosecuted simultaneously. If the code enforcement special magistrate or other appropriate court of competent jurisdiction determines that any of the alleged false alarm violations in the notice of violation were violations of the [fire prevention] code, the special magistrate or other appropriate court of competent jurisdiction may treat the first fire-response false alarm violation as having a maximum fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), and treat each subsequently determined separate false alarm violation in such group as a repeat violation, each of which will be subject to a maximum fine of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) notwithstanding what is written in this section. 
(l)  The police department and/or fire department may adopt a contract or enter into an agreement to oversee false alarm billing and collection services. The contractor's powers and duties under the contract or agreement may be adopted as a code section upon its approval. 
(1)  The police department and/or fire department by executing an agreement with their contractor do hereby invest in the contractor the regulatory authority to perform all duties identified in the scope of services of that certain agreement, including false alarm billing and collection services. 
(2)  Any contract or agreement between the police department and/or fire department and a billing/collection contractor may be adopted into the town code of ordinances in its entirety upon its execution by the party or parties, as approved, and as may be amended from time to time. 
(m)  Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this Code and section is, for any reason, held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion of this Code and section.

(3)  New, high-tech devices, commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes, or electronic vaporizers, have recently been made available to consumers. These devices closely resemble and purposefully mimic the art of smoking by having users inhale nicotine, or other potentially harmful chemical substances, created by heat through an electronic ignition system. Electronic cigarettes are created to look similar to a traditional cigarette, cigar or pipe. After inhaling, the user then blows out the heated vapors producing a "cloud" that is a nuisance to other people, similar to traditional cigarettes, cigars and pipes. 
(4)  The residents in the Town of Davie have the right to protect themselves against the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. 
(b)  Purpose. This section is enacted for the purpose of protecting the public health, safety, comfort and general welfare of the residents of the Town of Davie.

The term "electronic vaporizer" includes devices that are manufactured, distributed, marketed, or sold as an electronic cigarette, electronic cigar, electronic cigarillo, electronic pipe, electronic hookah, electronic vape, or any other product name or description. The term "electronic vaporizer" does not include any product specifically approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in the mitigation, treatment, or prevention of diseases. 
    Smoking includes the use of an electronic vaporizer which creates an aerosol or vapor, in any manner or in any form. 
(d)  Declaration of establishments and restaurants as smoke free. Smoking is prohibited inside of restaurants within the Town of Davie. A manager, operator, owner, or other person in control of any establishment or restaurant may permit smoking in a designated outdoor smoking area. This designated outdoor smoking area must not be within ten (10) feet of the establishment's entrance. 
(e)  Exemptions. Residences, retail tobacco shops, bars, research programs, and rooms listed under Florida Statute § 386.2045 are not affected by this Ordinance. 
(f)  Penalty. Any person who violates a provision of this section may be subject to a civil fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for the first violation and two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for subsequent violations. 
(g)  Appeals. Any appeals shall be filed with the special magistrate for the Town of Davie and be governed by the rules set forth in the special magistrate.

FIRST NOTICE OF VIOLATION 
DATE OF MAILING: 
TO: 
ADDRESS: 
PROPERTY NO.: 
As the Owner of the above-described property, you are hereby notified that a nuisance exists upon such property, contrary to the Town of Davie Graffiti Prevention and Removal Ordinance. The nuisance consists of graffiti as marked on the above-described property. You are hereby ordered to abate the nuisance by removing the graffiti within three (3) days of receipt of this Notice. Upon your failure to abate this nuisance within the time provided, Town employees, servants, agents or contractors will enter upon your property and abate the nuisance. The cost of such abatement will be levied as an assessment against your property. Thereafter, the Town Administrator shall prepare an assessment bill for the entire cost of abatement. The Town may record a lien against your property for the cost of abatement. 
If you wish to contest this Notice of Violation, you may appeal to the Town Administrator. Requests for appeal must be made in writing and should be directed to the Town Administrator within three (3) days of receipt of this Notice. The matter shall then be set for hearing by Special Magistrate. 
In the event of non-compliance with this notice, the Town shall provide a second notice containing an invoice detailing the costs incurred by the Town to abate the nuisance on your property along with a request for payment of these costs within fifteen (15) days of the date of the notice. In the event this invoice is not paid in full within fifteen (15) days, an assessment lien will be placed against your property. The assessment is created by a resolution signed by the Mayor and includes the cost to abate the nuisance and associated administrative costs. Under the resolution, the Town will be entitled to collect interest on the unpaid balance of the assessment at the rate of 12% per year for the life of the lien. Upon execution of the resolution, the Town Administrator will cause a certified copy of the resolution to be recorded in the official public records of Broward County, Florida. You should understand that once this resolution is recorded it constitutes a special assessment lien against your property that will remain until it is paid. This means that any subsequent transfer, sale or other disposition of the property will be affected or otherwise be encumbered by this lien. Further, you should also be aware that the Town has the power to enforce any assessment, together with this accumulated interest thereon, by civil action, including but not limited to, foreclosure of the lien. 
All questions and requests for appeals shall be directed to: 
Town Administrator

Within three (3) days of receipt of the first notice of violation by mail, hand-delivery or posting, the owner of the property may make a written request to the town administrator for a hearing to demonstrate that the condition alleged in the notice does not exist or that such a condition does not constitute a nuisance. All decisions of the town administrator shall be final. After expiration of the three (3) day abatement period, the town administrator shall re-inspect the property to ascertain whether the nuisance has been abated. Should the town administrator determine that the condition of the property remains a nuisance as defined in this article, the town administrator is authorized to enter upon the property and take such steps as are reasonably necessary to effect abatement. The town administrator is also authorized to abate the nuisance if reasonable attempts to notify the owner have failed. After abatement by the town, the town administrator shall prepare an assessment bill which includes the name of the owner, a description of the affected parcel, and a brief description of services rendered including administrative and operating expenses incurred in abating the nuisance. The town administrator shall send this information by regular mail to the owner. The notice shall demand payment of the assessment within fifteen (15) days of mailing; and shall provide that, if the assessment bill is not paid as directed, the town will place a lien against the property. Interest on said lien shall accrue at a rate of twelve (12) percent per annum on the unpaid balance of the assessment. The notice shall state that at the time and place mentioned (not less than thirty (30) days from the date of mailing of said notice), the council shall adopt a resolution that shall levy a special assessment lien in the full amount of such costs listed against the assessed property. Such resolution shall describe the property and show the cost of abatement. After the assessment resolution has been adopted, a certified copy of the resolution shall be recorded in the Official Records of Broward County. The special assessment lien shall become effective and due and payable to the town on the date the resolution is recorded in the official records of Broward County, and such recordation shall serve as constructive notice of the existence of said lien. Until payment is complete, such assessment shall be a legal, valid and binding obligation on the property. The form of the second notice shall be substantially as follows:

As the Owner of Record of the above-described property, you were notified on (date) that a nuisance existed on your property contrary to Town of Davie Graffiti Prevention and Removal Ordinance. At that time, you were ordered to abate the nuisance within three (3) days of receipt of notice, or risk the imposition of an assessment lien against the property for the full cost of abatement to the Town. Since the violation was not abated in a timely fashion, the Town Administrator took steps necessary to abate the nuisance. At the present time, there is an impending assessment lien which shall accrue interest at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum on any unpaid balance if not paid within fifteen (15) days from the date this notice was mailed. If the Town has not received full payment, the Town Council will adopt a resolution that shall levy a special assessment lien against the property. The assessment lien will be a legal, valid and binding obligation. Once recorded, the assessment lien shall run with the land and must be satisfied upon sale, transfer or any other disposition of the property. This assessment together with interest thereon, may be enforced by civil action in a Broward County Court of appropriate jurisdiction. It is hereby requested that you immediately pay such assessment to the Town of Davie.

ARTICLE VII. - SYNTHETIC CANNABINOIDS AND SYNTHETIC STIMULANTS 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 16-114. - Short title. 
    This article shall be known as and may be cited as the "Town of Davie Synthetic Drugs Prohibition Ordinance". 
(Ord. No. 2012-16, § 1, 8-1-12) 
Sec. 16-115. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The Town of Davie Mayor and Town Council members find and declare that synthetic substances described hereunder are commonly used as alternatives to cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy and other illegal drugs. The town council further finds that these synthetic substances are particularly appealing to youth, and that these synthetic substances are potentially dangerous to users in the short term and the long term effects are not yet known. The town council finds that the products which contain these synthetic substances often use a disclaimer that the product is "not for human consumption" to avoid regulations that require the manufacturer to list the product's active ingredients. The town council finds that drug designers and chemists can quickly create new synthetic drugs once federal or state law makes a particular synthetic drug illegal. As such, the town council finds there is a need to declare illegal the sale, offer for sale, purchase with intent to sell and public display for sale of synthetic substances that mimic illegal controlled substances, even though such synthetic substances have not yet themselves been categorized as illegal controlled substances under federal or state law. The town council further finds that it is proper and necessary for the town council to exercise its authority to safeguard and protect the public health, safety and welfare by taking this action. 
(b)  Application. This section shall be applicable throughout the incorporated municipal areas of the Town of Davie to the fullest extent allowed by law. 
(Ord. No. 2012-16, § 1, 8-1-12) 
Sec. 16-116. - Definitions.

Packaging that indicates, suggests or implies that a product mimics the pharmacological effects of cathinone, methcathinone, amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, ecstasy, or any other substance listed in Chapter 893, Florida Statutes, and the controlled substance schedules list, shall create a presumption that the product mimics the effects of the substance. "Synthetic stimulant" shall not include any substance currently listed in the controlled substance schedules in chapter 893, Florida Statutes, as may be amended from time to time, or otherwise prohibited by federal or state law.

(b)  It is the finding of the town council that many other alternative channels of communication (other than right-of-way canvassing and solicitation on the prohibited roadways) exist for persons who seek to exercise their First Amendment freedoms, such as, but by no means limited to, solicitation of funds or distribution of literature through the mail or at alternate locations (such as houses of worship, shopping areas and special events); the sale and/or distribution of newspapers through home or office delivery, vending machines and retail stores; and the sale of goods and services at retail stores, through the internet and from vending machines;

(d)  It is the intention of the town council to use the least restrictive means to advance the significant governmental interests of traffic safety and public safety and, consequently, the town's professional staff has analyzed each of the major roads within the town and determined that the roads listed in section 17-12.1 below present an increased and significant danger for use by distracted drivers, pedestrians and right-of-way canvassers and solicitors and pose the greatest threat to traffic and public safety in reference to activities and use by right-of-way canvassers and solicitors; 
(e)  Roads are primarily designed for vehicular traffic and are not suited to safely accommodate canvasser, right-of-way, salesperson, and sign solicitors; 
(f)  The presence of canvassers, right-of-way, salesperson, and sign solicitors interferes with the safe movement of normal vehicular traffic; 
(g)  The town council finds that it is in the best interests of the residents of the town to adopt this section.

ARTICLE II. - IMPACT FEES FOR POLICE, FIRE, PARKS AND RECREATION, AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATION SERVICES 

Sec. 18-21. - Authorization. 
    This article is enacted pursuant to the general police power, the authority granted to municipal corporations by Florida Constitution and Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2009-21, § 2, 8-19-09) 
Sec. 18-22. - Purpose and intent. 
    This article is for the purpose of requiring that new development pays for its fair share of public facilities through the imposition of impact fees which will be used to finance, defray or reimburse the town for all or a portion of the costs of public facilities which serve such development. The amount of each impact fee shall be calculated based upon the gross square footage of non-residential development, number of residential dwelling units, or other appropriate methodology which insures that the fee is roughly proportional to the impacts of new development on public facilities. 
(Ord. No. 2009-21, § 3, 8-19-09) 
Sec. 18-23. - Findings. 
    The town council hereby finds that impact fees collected pursuant to this article shall not be used to cure existing deficiencies in level of service. New residential and non-residential development imposes increased and excessive demands upon town public facilities. Planning, economic and demographic studies project that new development will continue and will place ever-increasing demands on the town to provide public facilities to serve the new development. To the extent that new development places demands upon public facilities, those demands should be satisfied by shifting the responsibility for financing the provision of such public facilities from the public to the development creating the demands. The town council, after careful consideration of the Burton & Associates, Inc. - Impact Fee Study results and the experience of other similarly situated towns and cities, finds that the imposition of impact fees to finance specified public facilities, the demand for which is created by new development, is in the best interests of the general welfare of the town and its residents, is equitable, and does not impose an unfair burden on new development.

ARTICLE VII. - RECLAIMED WATER AGREEMENT 

Sec. 25-68. - Reclaimed water agreement. 
    The Town of Davie Town Administrator, or his designee, is authorized to negotiate and enter into reclaimed water agreements on behalf of the town. Approval of said reclaimed water agreements shall be consistent with the terms of the rate study and reclaimed water agreement template approved by town council on July 18, 2012 (Resolution R-2012-165) 
(1)  Approval. The town administrator, or designee, shall approve a reclaimed water agreement after a full and thorough review consistent with the documents identified above and consistent with any other existing reuse commitments entered into by town council. Upon approval, a copy shall be kept in the official records of the Town of Davie. 
(2)  Delivery to property line. The town shall deliver reuse water to the property line of each user at between 40-65 psi. The end user shall be responsible for any onsite modifications, as may be necessary, unless otherwise agreed to. 
(3)  Terms. The terms of the reclaimed water agreement shall not exceed ten (10) years, unless otherwise agreed to. 
(4)  Cost of reuse water. The cost of reuse shall be adjusted annually by an amount equal to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase for all urban consumers for Miami-Fort Lauderdale, with a maximum annual increase of no more than three (3) percent, unless otherwise agreed to. The cost of reuse shall not be required to off-set actual costs of providing said water in recognition of the additional environmental and potable water costs that reuse is offset against. However, rates may be tiered based upon reuse consumption or the end use for said reuse in recognition of the costs savings provided through the provision of reuse through the reclaimed water agreement.

ARTICLE VIIA. - BACKFLOW AND CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL PROGRAM FOR THE RECLAIMED WATER NETWORK 

Sec. 25-70. - Intent and purpose. 
    The reclaimed water cross connection control outlined in this program shall be applied to the areas of the town that are served by the Town of Davie reclaimed water system. The policies and procedures provided in this document are in addition to other plumbing and cross connection control procedures and policies contained in other town ordinances. 
    The primary purpose of this program is to set rules for cross connection control that will be required for any actual or potential contamination as a result of cross connection with the town's reclaimed water system. Backflow may occur through an unprotected cross connection of the reclaimed water into a potable or supplemental water supply system. In addition to the public water system, expected use of supplemental (auxiliary) water supplies including groundwater and surface water by the town's reclaimed water users requires cross connection control as well. Proposed types of reclaimed water uses include irrigation, chilling, and industrial use and toilet flushing. Tank trucks may also be used for irrigation and other non-potable uses in the future, as needed. This program will help to control and prevent contamination due to actual and/or potential cross connection of the town's reclaimed water distribution system with potable water system and/or supplemental water systems. 
(Ord. No. 2013-5, § 2(Att. A), 2-20-13)

(Ord. No. 2013-5, § 2(Att. A), 2-20-13) 
Sec. 25-72. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Air gap separation: Unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the flood level rim of such vessel. An "approved air gap separation" shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above the top of the rim of the vessel. In no case shall it be less than one (1) inch. 
    Approved: Accepted by the town utilities or building departments as meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in this article, and is suitable for the proposed use. 
    Atmospheric vacuum breaker: A backflow prevention device which is operated by atmospheric pressure in combination with the force of gravity. The unit is designed to work on a vertical plane only. The one moving part consists of a poppet valve which must be carefully sized to slide in a guided chamber and effectively shut off the reverse flow of water when a negative pressure exists. 
    Backflow: The undesirable reversal of flow of non-potable water or other liquids, mixtures or substances under pressure into the water system from any source or sources other than its intended source. Backflow may take place through a cross connection and into the piping of a public water system or consumer's potable water system. There are two types of backflow: backpressure and backsiphonage. 
    Backpressure: Backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e.. downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains. 
    Backsiphonage: Backflow caused by a negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. The effect is similar to drinking water through a straw. Backsiphonage can occur when there is a stoppage of water supply due to nearby firefighting, a break in a water main, or any other situation that causes a significant loss in water system pressure. 
    Backflow prevention device: Any assembly, device or other means designed to prevent flow reversal through pipes or valves. 
    Building official: The principal enforcing officer of the Florida Building Code within a particular jurisdiction. In the town, it shall be the building official. 
    Certified backflow tester/technician: A person certified through one (1) of the following agencies as being competent to test, repair, overhaul, certify the operation, and make reports on backflow prevention devices: 
A.W.W.A. (American Water Works Association); 
F.W.P.C.O.A. (Florida Water Pollution Control Operator's Association); 
A.S.S.E (American Society of Sanitary Engineers); 
N.E.T.T.I (National Environmental Technology Training Institute); 
F.C.C.C.H.R. (Foundation for Cross Connection Control and Hydraulic Research); 
T.R.E.E.O- (Training Research and Education for Environmental Occupations); 
I.C.C.C. (Institution for Cross Connection Control); or 
By the device manufacturer's representative. 
    Contamination: An impairment of the potable water supply by the introduction or admission of any foreign substance that degrades the quality and causes a health hazard. 
    Cross connection: any physical connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures between two (2) otherwise separate pining systems, one of which contains potable water and the other non-potable water or industrial fluids through which, or because of which, backflow or backsiphonage may occur into the potable water system. 
    Cross connection control: A connection between a reclaimed water system and a supplemental water supply with an approved backflow prevention device properly installed that will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
    Customer: The person, firm, corporation or other legal entity whose name or names appear on billing for a water service connection from the town. 
    Degree of hazard: The term derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system. 
    Double check valve assembly: A device composed of two (2) single, independently acting check valves, including tightly closing shut-off valves located at each end of the device, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of each check valve. A check valve is a valve that is drip-tight in the normal direction of flow when the inlet pressure is one PSI (pound per square inch) and the outlet pressure is zero. The check valve shall permit no leakage in a direction reverse to the normal flow. The closure element (e.g.. clapper) shall be internally weighted or otherwise internally loaded to promote rapid and positive closure. 
    Health hazard: Any condition, device, or practice in the potable water supply system and its operation which could create or, in the judgment of the utilities director, may create a danger to the health and well-being of the potable water consumer. An example of a health hazard is a structural defect including cross connection, in a potable water supply system. 
    Owner: The person, firm, corporation or other legal entity that holds title to a property or premises. 
    Plumbing hazard: A plumbing-type cross connection in a consumer's potable water system that has not been properly protected by a vacuum breaker, air gap separation, or backflow prevention device. 
    Pollution hazard: An actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the potable water system or to the potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system which could constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or its appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to health. 
    Potable water: Any water which, according to recognized standards, is safe for human consumption. 
    Potable water service connection: The terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system. Service connection shall also include connections from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency connections from the utility system. 
    Pressure vacuum breaker: A pressure vacuum breaker is similar to an atmospheric vacuum breaker except that the checking unit "poppet valve" is activated by a spring. This type of vacuum breaker does not require a negative pressure to react and can be used on the pressure side of a valve.

(b)  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found under Rule 62-625.410, FAC including 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated. 
(1)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the control authority may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c), 62-625.410 (4)(A) FAC. 
(2)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, control authority shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e), 62-625.410 (6) FAC. 
(3)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, 62-625.700 FAC that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(4)  A CIU user may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this section. (See 40 CFR 403.15, 62-625.820 FAC). 
a.  Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in accordance with this section. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the town. Upon request of the industrial user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the requirements of paragraph b. of this subsection are met. 
b.  Criteria. 
1.  Either (i) The applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis; or (ii) The industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standard would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standard in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters. 
2.  Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere. 
3.  Credit shall be grant only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards(s), up to a maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this section. 
4.  Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the WWF discharge. The town may waive this requirement, after a written request and approval from FDEP, if it finds that no environmental degradation will result. 
(c)  State pretreatment standards. User must comply with state pretreatment standards located at Florida Administrative Code Volume 19, Chapter 62-625. 
(d)  Local limits. 
(1)  The control authority is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c), 62-625.400(3)(a). 
(2)  No person shall discharge wastewater containing pollutants in excess of the local limits for those pollutants which have been established for the town's WWFs using standard procedures, calculations and methods acceptable to FDEP to protect against pass through, interference, protection of WWF employees, and adverse affects on wastewater residuals disposal. No IU shall discharge process waste streams, unregulated waste streams, or dilute waste streams in excess of the concentrations set forth by the director. Local limits shall be included as permit conditions and attached to each SIU individual wastewater permit issued. 
The established local limits are subject to change and shall be modified as needed based on regulatory requirements and standards, WWF operation, performance and processes, the industrial user base, potable water quality and domestic wastewater characteristics. Modifications to the established local limits must be reviewed and approved by FDEP prior to implementation. Implementation shall be effective thirty (30) days from notice of acceptance of the modified limits by FDEP. Permitted SIUs shall also be issued an addendum to their wastewater discharge permit containing the new local limits. 
The established local limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the WWF. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. At his or her discretion, the utilities director, or his or her designee, may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration-based limitations. 
A copy of the approved local limits is available upon request at the following location.

Hollywood, Florida 33024 
(e)  Town of Davie, Florida, right of revision. The town reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the WWF consistent with the purpose of this article. 
(f)  Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The control authority may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 2012-26, § 1(Exh. A, § 25-51), 12-5-12)

The notice will indicate a location where the draft permit may be reviewed and an address where written comments may be submitted. 
(2)  Permit appeals. The control authority shall provide public notice of the issuance of a individual wastewater discharge permit. Any person, including the user, may petition the control authority to reconsider the terms of a wastewater discharge permit within thirty (30) days of notice of its issuance. 
a.  Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal. 
b.  In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the individual wastewater discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the wastewater discharge permit. 
c.  The effectiveness of the individual wastewater discharge permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal. 
d.  If the control authority fails to act within thirty (30) days, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not to reconsider an individual wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a individual wastewater discharge permit, or not to modify a individual wastewater discharge permit shall be considered final administrative actions for purposes of judicial review. 
e.  Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative individual wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a complaint with the circuit court in and for Broward County, Florida, within thirty (30) days from the final administrative action being appealed. 
(d)  Wastewater discharge permit modification. 
(1)  The control authority may modify an individual wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
a.  To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements; 
b.  To address significant alterations or additions to the user's operation, processes, or wastewater volume or character since the time of wastewater discharge permit issuance; 
c.  A change in the WWF that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge; 
d.  Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the town's WWF, personnel, or the receiving waters; 
e.  Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater discharge permit; 
f.  Misrepresentations or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application or in any required reporting; 
g.  Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical pretreatment standards pursuant to 40 CFR 403.13; 62-625.700, FAC. 
h.  To correct typographical or other errors in the wastewater discharge permit; or 
i.  To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or operation to a new owner operator. 
(e)  Individual wastewater discharge permit transfer. Individual wastewater discharge permits may be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee gives at least thirty (30) days advance notice to the control authority and the control authority approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice to the control authority must include a written certification by the new owner or operator which: 
(1)  States that the new owner and/or operator have no immediate intent to change the facility's operations and processes; 
(2)  Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and 
(3)  Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing wastewater discharge permit. 
    Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater discharge permit void as of the date of facility transfer. 
(f)  Individual wastewater discharge permit revocation. The control authority may revoke an individual wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
(1)  Failure to notify the control authority of significant changes to the wastewater prior to the changed discharge; 
(2)  Failure to provide prior notification to the control authority of changed conditions pursuant to subsection 25-86(e); 
(3)  Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application; 
(4)  Falsifying self-monitoring reports and certification statements; 
(5)  Tampering with monitoring equipment; 
(6)  Refusing to allow the control authority timely access to the facility premises and records;

(Ord. No. 2012-26, § 1(Exh. A, § 25-54), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 25-86. - Reporting requirements. 
(a)  Baseline monitoring reports. 
(1)  Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), 62-625.410(1)(d) FAC, whichever is later, existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the WWF shall submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraph (2), below. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraph (2), below. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. 
(2)  Users described above shall submit the information set forth below. 
a.  All information required in subsection 25-84(e)(1)a.1., subsection 25-84(e)(1)b., subsection 25-84(e)(1)c.1., and subsection 25-84(e)(1)f. See 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1)-(7), 62-625.600 
(1)-(7) FAC. 
b.  Measurement of pollutants. 
1.  The user shall provide the information required in subsections 25-84(e)(1)g.1. through 4. 
2.  The user shall take a minimum of one (1) representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
3.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from the pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) or 62-625.410(6) FAC to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) or 62-625.410(6) FAC, this adjusted limit, along with supporting data, shall be submitted to the control authority. 
4.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with subsection (j) herein. 
5.  The control authority may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. 
6.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date, and place of sampling and methods of analysis and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the WWF. 
c.  Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative as defined in subsection 25-81(d)(3) and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
d.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M is required. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in subsection (b) below. 
e.  Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be certified in accordance with subsection (n)(1) of this section and signed by an authorized representative as defined in subsection 25-81(d)(3). 
(b)  Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection (a)(2)d. hereinabove: 
(1)  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
(2)  No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months; 
(3)  The user shall submit a progress report to the control authority no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
(4)  In no event shall more than nine (9) months lapse between such progress reports to the control authority. 
(c)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the WWF, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the control authority a report containing the information described in subsection 25-84(e)(1)f. and g. and (a)(2)b of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in subsection 25-82(b), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the users actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (n)(1). All sampling will be done in accordance with subsection (k). 
(d)  Periodic compliance reports. 
(1)  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the control authority, submit no less than twice per year (in June and December) reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards, and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the control authority or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
(2)  All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (n)(1). 
(3)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the users discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(4)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the control authority, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (k), the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(e)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the control authority of any planned significant changes to the users' operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the change. 
(1)  The control authority may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under subsection 25-84(e). 
(2)  The control authority may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit under subsection 25-85(g) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under subsection 25-85(d) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, slug discharge or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the WWF, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the control authority of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the control authority, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the WWF, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (1) above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(4)  Significant industrial users are required to notify the control authority immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
(g)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the control authority as the control authority may require. 
(h)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the control authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. 
(i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)  Discharge of hazardous waste, as listed in 40 CFR Part 261 or 62-730 FAC, to the WWF is prohibited. 
(j)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in Rule 62-625.600(1)(e)6, FAC, Rule 62-160, FAC, and the Department of Environmental Protection Standard Operating Procedures for Field Activities, DEP-SOP-001/01 (DEP-SOP-001, FS 2400, Wastewater Sampling), in addition to 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard. If Rule 62-625.600(1)(e)6, FAC, Rule 62-160, FAC, and the Department of Environmental Protection Standard Operating Procedures for Field Activities, DEP-SOP-001/01 (DEP-SOP-001, FS 2400, Wastewater Sampling), or 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the FDEP determines that the Rule 62-625.600(1)(e)6, FAC, Rule 62-160, FAC, and the Department of Environmental Protection Standard Operating Procedures for Field Activities, DEP-SOP-001/01 (DEP- SOP-001, FS 2400, Wastewater Sampling), or CFR Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical techniques methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the control authority or other parties approved by the EPA or FDEP. 
(k)  Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsections (2) and (3) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the town, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136, 62-160 FAC, 62-600(6) (d) FAC and appropriate EPA or FDEP guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA or FDEP methodologies may be authorized by the town, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show with instantaneous limits. 
(2)  Samples for temperature, oil and grease, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, dissolved oxygen, chlorine residual, un-ionized ammonia, microbiology, specific conductance, dissolve constituents and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(3)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in subsections (a) and (c) of this section {40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)}, 62-625.600(1) and (3) F.A.C, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the control authority may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs Section 6.4 (40CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), (62-625.600 (4)(A) and (7)(A) the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to asses and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(l)  Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(m)  Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements and documentation associated with best management practices established under subsection 25-82(d)(3). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the control authority, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the control authority. 
(n)  Certification statements. 
(1)  Certification of permit applications, user reports and initial monitoring waiver. The following certification statement is required to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit applications in accordance with subsection 25-84(g); users submitting baseline monitoring reports under subsection (a)(2)e. of this section; users submitting reports on compliance with the categorical pretreatment standard deadlines under subsection (c); users submitting periodic compliance reports required by subsection (d)(1) through (4), and users submitting an initial request to forego sampling of a pollutant on the basis of subsection (d)(2)d. The following certification statement must be signed by an authorized representative as defined in subsection 25-81(d)(3): 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
(Ord. No. 2012-26, § 1(Exh. A, § 25-55), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 25-87. - Compliance monitoring. 
(a)  Right of entry; inspection and sampling. The control authority shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the control authority ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the control authority will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(2)  The control authority shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(3)  The control authority may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy. 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of control authority and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the control authority access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article. 
(b)  Search warrants. If the control authority has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the town designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the control authority may seek issuance of a court order requiring compliance with this article from the circuit court in and for Broward County, Florida. 
(Ord. No. 2012-26, § 1(Exh. A, § 25-56), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 25-88. - Confidential information. 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the control authority inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the control authority, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law and that said information is not a public record under Chapter 119 of the Florida Statutes. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. No. 2012-26, § 1(Exh. A, § 25-57), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 25-89. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
    The control authority shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the WWF is located, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all significant industrial users (or any other industrial user that violates paragraphs (c), (d), or (h) of this section) and shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined in section 25-82; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by section 25-82 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, COD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by section 25-82 (Daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limits, or narrative standard) that the control authority determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of WWF personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of pollutants that have caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or have resulted in the control authority exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within forty-five (45) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation(s) which may include a violation of best management practice, which the control authority determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 2012-26, § 1(Exh. A, § 25-58), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 25-90. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within sixty (60) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the control authority. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the control authority to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The control authority may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The control authority may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the utilities director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least five (5) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user as defined in subsection 25-81(d)(3) and required by subsection 25-84(g)(1). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(d)  Compliance orders. When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the control authority may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Administrative fines. 
(1)  When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority may fine such user in an amount not to exceed the maximum fine allowed pursuant to the laws of the State of Florida. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(2)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of fifty (50) percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of five (5) percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
(3)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the control authority to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, [the superintendent] may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The control authority may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
(4)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. The control authority may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The control authority may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the WWF, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the control authority may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the WWF, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The control authority may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the control authority that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (h) are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the control authority prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsections (c) and (h). 
    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this [sub]section. 
(h)  Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in subsection 25-85(f), any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of individual wastewater discharge permits conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 25-82. 
    Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (c) why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the control authority shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 2012-26, § 1(Exh. A, § 25-59), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 25-91. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority may petition the circuit court in and for Broward County, Florida, for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The control authority may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(b)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the town for a maximum civil penalty in an amount not to exceed the maximum allowed under the laws of the State of Florida, however, not less than the amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(2)  The control authority may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the town. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(c)  Criminal prosecution. 
(1)  A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day and not more than the maximum fine allowed under the laws of the State of Florida, per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both. 
(2)  A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the WWF which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or be subject to imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(3)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of at least one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both. 
(4)  In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of not more than the maximum fine allowable under state law per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both. 
(d)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The control authority may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with town's enforcement response plan. However, the control authority may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the control authority is empowered to take more than one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. No. 2012-26, § 1(Exh. A, § 25-60), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 25-92. - Supplemental enforcement action. 
(a)  Penalties for late reports. A penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be assessed to any user for each day that a report required by this section, a permit or order issued hereunder is late, beginning five (5) days after the date the report is due [higher penalties may also be assessed where reports are more than thirty (30) to forty-five (45) days late]. Actions taken by the control authority to collect late reporting penalties shall not limit the control authority's authority to initiate other enforcement actions that may include penalties for late reporting. 
(b)  Performance bonds. The control authority may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the town in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the control authority to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
(c)  Liability insurance. The control authority may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the WWF caused by its discharge. 
(d)  Payment of outstanding fees and penalties. The control authority may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to pay outstanding fees, fines or penalties incurred as a result of any provision of this article, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. 
(e)  Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
(f)  Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the control authority.

(Ord. No. 2012-26, § 1(Exh. A, § 25-61), 12-5-12) 
Sec. 25-93. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (3), below, are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the control authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days: 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 25-82(a)(1) or the specific prohibitions in subsection 25-82(a)(2)c. through r. if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or Interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the town was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
b.  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection. 
(3)  Bypass notifications. 
a.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the control authority at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
b.  A user shall submit oral notice to the control authority of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its' cause, the duration of the bypass (including exact dates and times), and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The control authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(4)  Bypass. 
a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless 
1.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
3.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (3) of this subsection. 
b.  The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the control authority determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph (4)a. of this section.

In addition there is a one-time seven-hundred-fifty-dollar administrative fee for new permittees to establish compliance histories. A permittee may apply for a multi-year permit, not to exceed five (5) years, if permittee meets the criteria and guidelines established by the EPA. Industrial users whose permits lapse will be treated as new applicants, subject to seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) administrative fee, in order to reapply; 
(2)  Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing an industrial user's discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users. Analytical fees will be based on cost of analysis to the control authority and may be adjusted annually. 
(3)  Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
(4)  Fees for filing appeals; and 
(5)  Fees to recover administrative and legal cost (not included in subsection (a)(2) associated with the enforcement activity taken by the control authority to address industrial user noncompliance; and

(Ord. No. O2018-018, § 2(Exh. A), 6-13-18) 
ARTICLE IV. - ROADWAY DEBRIS REMOVAL 

Sec. 28-9. - Debris removal from private streets, roads, roadways and private property. 
(a)  After declaration of local state of emergency in accordance with this chapter, the primary mission of the town will be to protect lives and property, restore governmental services and clear public streets. Depending on the magnitude of the disaster and after accomplishment of the primary mission, resources may be available to the town that may not be available to a private property owner. The intent and purpose of this section is to establish a process by which the town may evaluate and, if necessary, remove disaster-generated debris from along privately owned streets, roads, roadways, and other private property in the event of an immediate threat to life, public health and safety after a significant disaster. While the town recognizes that, as a general proposition, the removal of disaster-generated debris from private property is the responsibility of the property owner, there are occasions when, because of the magnitude of the disaster and the threat posed to life, health, and safety, there may be a compelling need to remove disaster-generated debris from private streets, roads, and roadways and other private property as described herein. 
(b)  The town may remove debris from private roadways when such debris is determined to pose an immediate threat to the health, safety and welfare of the community. The town administrator, or designee, shall determine whether there is an immediate threat to the public health, safety, and welfare sufficient to warrant removal of debris in accordance with any one (1) of the following standards: 
(1)  There is a significant likelihood that emergency vehicles will be significantly hindered from rendering emergency services to residential and commercial property should the debris be allowed to remain in place absent town removal. 
(2)  The type of debris is such that it may reasonably cause disease, illness, or sickness which could injure or adversely affect the health, safety, or general welfare of those residing and working in the area if it is allowed to remain. 
(3)  The clearing is necessary to effectuate orderly and expeditious restoration of town-wide utility services including, but not limited to, power, water, sewer, and communication. 
(4)  The debris is determined by the town administrator, or designee, to be dangerous or hazardous. 
(5)  The debris prevents garbage collection thereby creating a public health hazard. 
(6)  The debris contains contaminants which have a reasonable likelihood of leeching into the soil and/or aquifer. 
(7)  The debris has a substantial negative impact in preventing or adversely affecting emergency repairs to buildings and/or property. 
(8)  The debris presents a reasonable danger of being transported by wind and/or water into the surrounding areas of the town and thereby increasing the cost of recovery and removal. 
(9)  The debris poses a significant likelihood of, if left over time, producing mold which would be injurious to public health. 
(10)  The presence of the debris significantly adversely impacts the town's recovery efforts. 
(11)  The debris significantly interferes with drainage or water runoff, so as to be a significant hazard in the event of significant rainfall. 
(12)  The sheer volume of the debris is such that it is impractical and unreasonable to remove in an orderly and efficient manner absent action by the town. 
(13)  The type, extent and nature of the debris is such that it would cause much greater damage if the debris was not removed immediately. 
(14)  Debris removal in commercial or other specific areas will be cleared if, in the opinion of the town administrator or designee, the clearance will aid the town's recovery operations or aid the health, safety, or welfare of the residents. 
(c)  Indemnification and hold harmless. Prior to removal of debris by the town as contemplated herein on private roadways and private property, or clearance by the town of private property as provided herein, the private property owner shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the federal, state, and local government and all employees, officers and agents of the federal, state, and local government connected with the rendering of such service. 
(d)  Emergency roadway clearance. Nothing herein shall preclude a first response by the town to clear and push debris from all roadways (both public and private) including access to properties when deemed necessary for emergency vehicles. 
(Ord. No. O2018-018, § 2(Exh. A), 6-13-18) 
ARTICLE V. - EMERGENCY OPERATIONS 

Sec. 28-10. - Emergency field operations center. 
(a)  The town will maintain a hardened emergency field operations center (herein "FOC") to provide standard local coordination and control of emergency, special event, or disaster response and relief operations. The FOC will be equipped with the necessary information technology, redundant communications, plans and procedures and will be supported by appropriate town personnel. The FOC will be managed by the emergency manager, or designee, in accordance with the National Incident Management System. The FOC will be staffed during each activation with senior officials and support organization representatives as needed. FOC personnel will serve as the town's coordination center for town administration and leadership and provide for the following: 
(1)  Coordinate with Broward County, State of Florida, federal agencies, and private organizations on emergency response and recovery operations. 
(2)  Provide coordination and support to the disaster field operations. 
(3)  Arrange for and deploy logistical resources that exceed the capabilities of the town. 
(4)  Coordinate and release disaster related public information. 
(5)  Perform and exercise such other functions, powers, and duties as may be deemed necessary to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population, including individuals with household pets and service animals prior to, during, and following a major disaster or emergency. 
(6)  Coordinate safety and wellness checks of special needs residents in group homes, assisted living facilities and those town residents enrolled in the Broward County vulnerable population registry (VPR).
