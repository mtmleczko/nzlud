PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Zion, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1969 Code, as supplemented, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1969 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. 
CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Berle Swartz, City Attorney, and Ms. Judy Smith, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2-45. - Electronic attendance at meetings rules. 
(a)  Rules statement. It is the policy of the City of Zion that any members of the city council may attend any open or closed meeting of the city council via electronic means (such as by telephone, video or internet connection) provided that such attendance is in compliance with these rules and any applicable laws. For purposes of the City Code, "meeting" shall be as defined in 5 ILCS 120/1.02 of the Open Meetings Act (as may be amended from time to time) and shall mean any gathering, whether in person or by video or audio conference, telephone call, electronic means (such as, without limitation, electronic mail, electronic chat and instant messaging), or other means of contemporaneous interactive communication, of a majority of a quorum of the members of a public body held for the purpose of discussing public business. 
(b)  Prerequisites. A member of the city council may attend a meeting electronically if the member meets the following conditions: 
(1)  The member should notify the city clerk at least 48 hours before the meeting, unless impractical, so that necessary communications equipment can be arranged. Such notice shall be in writing, if possible. Inability to make the necessary technical arrangements will result in denial of a request for remote attendance. 
(2)  The member must assert one of the following three reasons why he or she is unable to physically attend the meeting. 
a.  The member cannot attend because of personal illness or disability; or 
b.  The member cannot attend because of employment purposes or the business of the city; or 
c.  The member cannot attend because of a family or other emergency. 
(c)  Authorization to participate. 
(1)  The clerk or his or her designee, after receiving the electronic attendance request, shall inform the city council of the request for electronic attendance. 
(2)  After establishing that there is a quorum physically present at a meeting where a member of the city council desires to attend electronically, the presiding officer shall state that (i) a notice was received by a member of the city council in accordance with these rules, and (ii) the member will be deemed authorized to attend the meeting electronically unless a motion objecting to the member's electronic attendance is made, seconded, and approved by two-thirds of the members of the city council physically present at the meeting. If no such motion is made and seconded or if any such motion fails to achieve the required vote by the members of the city council, physically present at the meeting, then the request by the member to attend the meeting electronically shall be deemed approved by the city council and the presiding officer shall declare the requesting member present. After such declaration by the presiding officer, the question of a member's electronic attendance may not be reconsidered. 
(d)  Adequate equipment required. The member participating electronically and other members of the city council must be able to communicate effectively, and members of the audience must be able to hear all communications at the meeting site. Before allowing electronic attendance at any meeting, the city council shall provide equipment adequate to accomplish this objective at the meeting site. 
(e)  Minutes. Any member attending electronically shall be considered an off-site attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting if the member is allowed to attend. The meeting minutes shall also reflect and state specifically whether each member is physically present or present by electronic means. 
(f)  Rights of remote member. A member permitted to attend electronically will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting and participate in the same capacity as those members physically present, subject to all general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and adhered to. The member attending electronically shall be heard, considered, and counted as to any vote taken. Accordingly, the name of any member attending electronically shall be called during any vote taken, and his or her vote counted and recorded by the clerk and placed in the minutes for the corresponding meeting. A member attending electronically may leave a meeting and return as in the case of any member, provided the member attending electronically shall announce his or her leaving and returning. 
(g)  Committees, boards and commissions. These rules shall apply to all committees, boards and commissions established by authority of the city council.

(4)  The legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held; 
(5)  The penalties for a failure to appear at the hearing; including, with respect to code violations related to the standing, parking or condition of a vehicle a statement to the effect that vehicle immobilization and driver's license suspension may be imposed if fines and penalties are not paid in full; and 
(6)  Any witnesses or complainants who may be called to testify for the city but who are not employees or officers of the city. 
(d)  Administrative adjudication hearings shall be scheduled and docketed by the code administrator no less than 30 and no more than 40 days after the notice of hearing is served on the Defendant. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-34, § 1, 9-21-04; Ord. No. 17-O-65, § II, 11-21-17) 
Sec. 3-9. - Hearing procedures. 
(a)  [ Generally. ] Parties shall be provided with an opportunity for a hearing before or during which they may exercise any or all of the following rights: 
(1)  The right to be represented by counsel, at the party's own expense. This section does not afford a defendant the right to counsel appointed by the city or the code administrator. 
(2)  Present and cross-examine witnesses; 
(3)  Introduce relevant documentary evidence; 
(4)  Request the hearing officer to issue subpoenas to direct the attendance and testimony of relevant witnesses or the production of relevant tangible evidence. 
(b)  Rules of evidence shall not govern. The formal and technical rules of evidence shall not apply in an administrative adjudication hearing authorized under this chapter. Hearsay evidence, however, may be admitted only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. 
(c)  Standard of proof. Administrative adjudication hearings are civil in nature. The city shall bear the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation of the Code exists or has occurred. A sworn, written pleading, complaint or citation shall constitute prima facie evidence of the violation. 
(d)  Defenses. It shall be a defense to a code violation charged under this chapter if the owner, his attorney, or any other agent or representative proves by a preponderance of the evidence that: 
(1)  The code violation alleged in the notice did not in fact exist at the time of the citation, pleading or complaint; 
(2)  The code violation alleged in the notice occurred before the owner became owner of the real or personal property in question. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (d)(2) of this section, however, any existing order or judgment ordering the correction of a code violation and/or sanctions imposed by the hearing officer as a result of a finding of a code violation under this chapter shall attach to the property as well as to the owner of the property, so that a finding of a code violation against one owner cannot be avoided by conveying or transferring the property to another owner. Any subsequent transferee or owner of the property takes the same subject to any order or judgment issued by a hearing officer under this chapter. 
It shall not be a defense to a Code violation charged under this chapter if the Code violation alleged in the notice was committed by a tenant or non-owner occupant of the property. The owner remains at all times responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable provisions of the Code. 
(e)  Continuances. Continuances are not to be granted liberally. A continuance of an administrative adjudication hearing may be granted by the hearing officer, but only in a case in which a continuance is absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the defendant or owner. If granted, a continuance may not exceed 30 days except in extraordinary and compelling circumstances. 
(f)  Judicial review. 
(1)  A decision and order or order or default determining that a Code violation has or has not occurred, together with any fine or other penalty or sanction imposed, shall be subject to review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law. Any person filing for administrative review under the Administrative Law shall be subject to the assessment of costs for the preparation and certification of the record of proceedings before the hearing officer. 
(2)  A judgment entered by the hearing officer shall be subject to appeal in accordance with Illinois Supreme Court Rules by the same means and in the same manner as an appeal from a judgment from a circuit court. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-34, § 1, 9-21-04; Ord. No. 17-O-65, § II, 11-21-17) 
Sec. 3-10. - Enforcement of judgment. 
(a)  Any fine, other sanction or costs (including attorneys' fees) imposed, or part of any fine, other sanction or cost imposed, remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of or the failure to exhaust judicial review procedures under section 3-8, subsection (f) of this chapter or as otherwise provided by law are a debt due and owing the City of Zion and may be collected in accordance with applicable law. 
(b)  Upon being recorded in the manner required by Article XII of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure or by the Uniform Commercial Code, a lien shall be imposed on the real estate or personal estate, or both, of the defendant in the amount of any debt due and owing to the city under this chapter. The lien may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien recorded pursuant to the judgment order of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(c)  If any judgment entered under this chapter is set aside by the hearing officer or a court of competent jurisdiction, the hearing officer shall have the authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien which has been recorded for the debt due and owing to the city under subsection (b) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-34, § 1, 9-21-04; Ord. No. 14-O-14, § II, 3-4-14; Ord. No. 17-O-65, § II, 11-21-17) 
Sec. 3-11. - Enforcement of motor vehicle violations; citations. 
(a)  Whenever any vehicle is parked in violation of any provision of the Code prohibiting or restricting vehicular parking, stopping or standing, the owner shall be prima facie responsible for the violation and subject to the penalty therefor. 
(b)  Whenever any vehicle is parked in violation of any provision of the Code prohibiting or restricting vehicular parking, stopping or standing, any police officer, traffic control aide, other designated member of the police department, parking enforcement aide or other person designated by the code administrator or the chief of police who observes such violation may issue a parking violation notice, and serve the owner of the vehicle by handing it to the operator of the vehicle, if he or she is present, or by affixing it to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. The issuer of the notice shall specify on the notice his identification number, the particular parking regulation allegedly violated, the make and state registration number of the cited vehicle, and the place, date, time and nature of the alleged violation and he or she shall certify the correctness of the specified information by signing his name as provided in Section 11-208.3 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/11-208.3, as amended. The foregoing shall not relieve the code administrator from the duties set forth in sections 3-6 and 3-8 above, with respect to scheduling a hearing on such alleged violation and providing notice thereof. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful for any person, other than the owner of the vehicle or his designee, to remove from a vehicle a parking violation notice affixed pursuant to this chapter. 
(d)  The code administrator shall distribute parking violation notices to parking enforcement aides, other persons authorized to issue parking violating notices, and the department of police for issuance pursuant to these provisions. The chief of police shall be responsible for the distribution of the notice forms within the department of police, shall maintain a record of each set of notices issued to individual members of the department and shall retain a receipt for every set so issued. 
(e)  The code administrator shall compile and maintain complete and accurate records relating to all parking violation notices issued and the dispositions thereof, whether by payment of the fine or by final determination of the hearing officer. In addition, the code administrator shall make certified reports to the Secretary of State pursuant to Section 6-306.5 of the Illinois Vehicle Code. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-34, § 1, 9-21-04; Ord. No. 17-O-65, § II, 11-21-17) 
Sec. 3-12. - Determination of liability; motor vehicle citations. 
(a)  Whenever a Defendant either fails to pay the indicated fine prior to the hearing and also fails to appear at a hearing, an order of default containing a determination of vehicular parking or compliance code violation liability shall be entered in the amount of the fine indicated on the notice of violation. Failure to pay the fine within 21 days of a final determination of vehicular parking and compliance code violation liability, whether by order of default or decision and order will result in the imposition of a late payment penalty pursuant to subsection (b) herein. Upon the occurrence of a determination of vehicular parking and compliance code violation liability, and after expiration of the period in which judicial review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law may be sought any unpaid fine or penalty will constitute a debt due and owing the city. 
(b)  Failure by any defendant to pay or mail payment of the fine for a vehicular parking and compliance code violation within 21 days of the issuance of the final determination of liability will automatically subject the defendant to a penalty for late payment. The penalty for late payment shall be the amount set forth in the table described in Exhibit "A" attached hereto and incorporated by reference. Failure to pay or mail payment of the fine after an additional 60-day period will result in the fine being referred to a collection agency and will automatically subject the defendant to an additional administrative fee plus collection agency fees. 
(c)  Defenses. A person charged with a parking violation may contest the charge through an administrative adjudication hearing limited to one or more of the following grounds, with appropriate evidence to support: 
(1)  That the defendant was not the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle at the time of the violation; 
(2)  That the cited vehicle or its state registration plates were stolen at the time the violation occurred; 
(3)  That the relevant signs prohibiting or restricting parking, as applicable, were missing or obscured; 
(4)  That the relevant parking meter was inoperable or malfunctioned through no fault of the defendant; 
(5)  That the facts alleged in the parking violation notice are inconsistent or do not support a finding that the specified regulation was violated. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-34, § 1, 9-21-04; Ord. No. 14-O-14, § II, 3-4-14; Ord. No. 17-O-65, § II, 11-21-17) 
Editor's note- Exhibit "A" is set out following this chapter. 
Sec. 3-13. - Lessor of vehicle-Liability. 
    In accordance with Section 11-1306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, no person who is the lessor of a vehicle pursuant to a written lease agreement shall be liable for a violation of any standing or parking regulation of this chapter involving such vehicle during the period of the lease if upon receipt of a notice of violation he shall, within 60 days thereafter, provide to the code administrator the name and address of the lessee. Upon receipt of a lessor's notification of the name and address of his lessee, pursuant to Section 11-1305 or 11-1306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, upon receipt of the lessor's notification of the name and address of the lessee, the code administrator shall cause a notice of violation to be sent to the lessee as provided herein. If the lessor fails to provide the code administrator with the name and address of the lessee within 60 days of receiving notice, the lessor shall be liable for the full amount of the violation and late penalties, and a final determination will be issued. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-34, § 1, 9-21-04; Ord. No. 17-O-65, § II, 11-21-17) 
Sec. 3-14. - Immobilization program. 
(a)  The code administrator is hereby authorized to direct and supervise a program of vehicle immobilization or towing and impounding for the purpose of enforcing vehicular parking, or compliance violations of the code. The program of vehicle immobilization or towing and impounding shall provide for immobilizing or towing and impounding any eligible vehicle, as defined in subsection (b), below, by placement of a restraint (immobilization device known as a vehicle boot) in such a manner as to prevent operation of the vehicle or the immediate towing and impounding of such vehicle. 
    If the eligible vehicle is parked within the City of Zion, or lawfully stopped in violation of any provision of the traffic code. The code administrator, chief of police, or his designee may cause the eligible vehicle immediately to be immobilized or towed to a vehicle pound. 
(b)  When the registered owner of a vehicle has accumulated three or more final determinations of vehicular parking or compliance code violations for which the fines and penalties, if applicable, have not been paid in full, the code administrator shall cause a notice of impending vehicle immobilization or towing or impounding to be sent as prescribed in this chapter. 
    The notice of impending vehicle immobilization or towing and impounding shall state the name and address of the registered owner, the state registration number of the vehicle or vehicles registered to such owner, the listing of violations for which the person has been determined to be liable of vehicular parking, or compliance code violations, the date of issuance, and the total amount of fines and penalties assessed. Failure to pay the fines and penalties owed within 21 days from the date of the notice shall result in the inclusion of the state registration number of the vehicle(s) of such owner on an immobilization and/or immediate towing and impounding list. 
    A person may challenge the validity of the notice of impending vehicle immobilization or towing and impounding by requesting a hearing and appearing in person to submit evidence which would conclusively disprove eligibility. Such hearing shall not be a forum to re-adjudicate the findings of fact and law issued by the hearing officer. Upon a request for a hearing, the code administrator shall schedule the hearing for the next available hearing date. 
    Documentary evidence, which would conclusively disprove liability, may be based on the following grounds: 
(1)  That all fines and penalties for the vehicular parking, or compliance violations cited in the notice have been paid in full; or 
(2)  That the registered owner has not accumulated three or more final determinations of vehicular parking, or compliance code violations liability which were unpaid at the time the notice of impending vehicle immobilization or tow and impound notice was issued. 
(c)  Upon immobilization of an eligible vehicle, a notice shall be affixed to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. Such notice shall warn that the vehicle is immobilized and that any attempt to move the vehicle may result in its damage. The notice shall also state that the unauthorized removal of or damage to the immobilizing restraint is a violation of Sections 16-1 and 21-1 of the Illinois Criminal Code. The notice shall also provide information specifying how release of the immobilizing restraint may be had, and how the registered owner may obtain an immobilization hearing. If the restraint has not been released within 48 hours of its placement, the restraint shall be released and the vehicle towed and impounded. 
(d)  The owner of an immobilized or towed and impounded vehicle or other authorized person may secure the release of the vehicle by paying the immobilization installation and removal fees, towing and storage fees provided in subsection (g) herein, collection costs due, and all fines and penalties remaining due on each final determination of parking, or compliance code violation liability issued to such person. 
(e)  The owner of an immobilized or towed and impounded vehicle shall have the right to a hearing to determine whether the immobilization or any subsequent towing and impoundment was erroneous, provided that the owner files a written request for a hearing with the code administrator within 14 days after immobilization or towing and impounding or 14 days of the date of the notice sent pursuant to subsection (g) herein, whichever is later. Such hearing shall not be a forum to re-adjudicate the findings of fact and law issued by the hearing officer. The determination of the hearing officer regarding the validity of the immobilization or towing and impounding shall become final upon issuance for the purpose of administrative review under the Administrative Review Law. The owner shall be limited to the same defenses prescribed in paragraph 2 above. 
(f)  Within ten days after a vehicle has been impounded, a notice of impoundment shall be sent by first class mail, to the address of the registered owner as listed with the Secretary of State. The notice shall state that the owner has the right to request a post-immobilization and post-towing hearing as provided in subsection (e), above, and that if the vehicle is not claimed within 60 days from the date of the notice, the vehicle may be sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with Section 4-208 of the Illinois Vehicle Code. 
(g)  The fee for immobilization shall be $50.00. In addition, a fee for towing subsequent to the immobilization and a storage fee for every 24-hour period the vehicle is retained shall be assessed. No fees shall be assessed for any immobilization or towing which has been determined to be erroneous. 
(h)  It shall be unlawful to relocate or tow any vehicle restrained by an immobilization device without the approval of the code administrator, chief of police or his designee. The registered owner of the immobilized vehicle and any person who relocates an immobilized vehicle in violation of this subsection shall each be subject to a penalty of $750.00 for each such violation. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-34, § 1, 9-21-04; Ord. No. 14-O-14, § II, 3-4-14; Ord. No. 17-O-65, § II, 11-21-17) 
Sec. 3-15. - Driver's license suspension. 
(a)  When a person has failed to pay any fine or penalty due and owing pursuant to this chapter with respect to ten or more parking violations, the code administrator shall cause a notice of impending driver's license suspension to be sent in the form as required by the Secretary of State. The notice shall state that failure to pay the amount owing within 45 days of the date of the notice will result in the city's notifying the Secretary of State that the person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings pursuant to Section 6-306.5 of the Illinois Vehicle Code. 
(b)  If a person sent a notice pursuant to subsection (a) fails to pay the amount owing within the time stated on the notice, the code administrator may file with the Secretary of State, a certified report, in accordance with Section 6-306.5(c) of the Illinois Vehicle Code, that the person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings. The code administrator shall assess a $20.00 filing fee against the person named in the certified report to reimburse the city for the expense of preparing and filing the certified report with the Secretary of State. 
(c)  A person named in a certified report filed pursuant to subsection (b) may, within 21 days of the date of the notice sent by the Secretary of State pursuant to Section 6-306.5(b) of the Illinois Vehicle Code; file with the code administrator a written statement and supporting documentation to challenge the report; provided, however, the grounds for such challenge shall be limited to the following contentions: (1) that the person was not the owner or lessee of the vehicle or vehicles receiving ten or more parking violations notices on the date or dates such notices were issued; (2) that the person has already paid the fine and penalty for the ten or more violations indicated on the report; and/or (3) that the person has not accumulated ten or more final determinations of parking violation liability. The code administrator shall send notice of the decision on the challenge to the report after receipt thereof. 
(d)  If a person named in a certified report has paid the previously reported fine or penalty or if the report is determined by the code administrator to be in error, the code administrator shall notify the Secretary of State in accordance with Section 6-306.5(d) of the Illinois Vehicle Code. A certified copy of such notification shall be given, upon request and at no charge, to the person named therein. 
(e)  An administrative hearing to contest a suspension or impending suspension or suspension may be had upon filing a written request with the Secretary of State. Such hearing shall not be a forum to re-adjudicate the findings of fact and law issued by the hearing officer. The filing fee for this hearing shall be $20.00, to be paid at the time the request is made. The city shall reimburse the Secretary of State for all reasonable costs incurred by the secretary as a result of filing a certified report, including but not limited to the costs of providing the required notice and the costs incurred by the secretary in any hearing conducted with respect to the report and any appeal from such a hearing. In the event the owner is found eligible for suspension such owner shall reimburse the city for all of the foregoing costs.

(a)  It shall be the duty of the owner of any dog or other animal to prevent such dog or other animal from biting or attacking any person in the city, and if a person is bitten by a dog or other animal he shall report the incident to the police department immediately. Any unprovoked dog or other animal which may bite or attack any person in the city is hereby declared to be a nuisance, and such dog or other animal may be apprehended and impounded at any time by any police officer, animal warden or other person charged with the enforcement of this chapter. If such dog or other animal is impounded, the owner shall have no right to redeem the dog or other animal if it has unprovokedly attacked or bitten any person in the city on two or more separate occasions within any 24-month period, unless he shall remove such dog or other animal from the city immediately upon redemption and shall not thereafter keep, or otherwise maintain such dog or other animal in the city at any time.

Applications for such permits shall be made in writing to the building department, upon blank forms to be supplied by such building department, and shall be accompanied by plans and specifications for the work contemplated and the estimate of the cost. 
(2)  No building permit shall be issued for erecting, remodeling, removing, or altering of a single-family structure or for a multi-family, industrial, or commercial structure, without the stamp and signature of an architect or structural engineer, licensed by the State of Illinois, on the plans and drawings. The building official is authorized to waive the submission of construction documents prepared by a design professional if it is found that the nature of the work applied for is such that reviewing of construction documents is not necessary to obtain compliance with the Code. 
(3)  No building permit for new construction shall be issued unless and until a grading plan has been submitted to and approved by the director of engineering. Said grading plan shall be completed by a professional engineer or surveyor licensed in the State of Illinois with his/her seal and signature affixed thereto. 
(b)  No excavation shall be started or work done on any structure unless the permit is conspicuously posted on the property. It shall be unlawful for any builder or contractor to start any such excavation or work unless such permit is so posted. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful to construct or alter any building or structure in the city, except upon compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(d)  All work shall be inspected, to insure strict compliance with all building requirements adopted by the city, before such work is concealed or covered; providing, however, concealed work may be approved by the building inspector when such compliance is certified by a reliable, independent and unbiased third party. For the purposes of this subsection a third party shall mean a party or firm duly bonded and fully knowledgeable with all construction components relative to each unit. 
(e)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Code to the contrary, the city council may approve, by resolution duly adopted, the issuance of a unified demolition and site restoration permit for the demolition of multiple buildings and structures on, and the restoration of, any parcel or parcels under single ownership, control or leasehold interest and located in the G-1 General Industrial Zoning District of the city.

Upon issuance of a unified demolition and site restoration permit, the permittee shall not be required to obtain any other permits or approvals otherwise required pursuant to this Code for such demolition or site restoration. The fee for the unified demolition and site restoration permit shall be established in an amount which is based upon a good faith and reasonable estimate of the costs and expenses that the city will incur for all services provided by the city in connection with, and over the term of, the unified demolition and site restoration permit. The fee amount, the schedule for payment of the fee, the extent of the approved demolition and site restoration activities, and any conditions of approval shall be set forth in a written agreement to be executed by the city and the permittee as a condition of the issuance of the permit. Such a permit shall be applicable to demolition and site restoration work relative to projects which are regulated by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Structures that the City of Zion has boarded-up will automatically be registered and a lien placed on the property to recover the registration fee and cost of board-up service.

Footnotes:

Cross reference- Similar provisions, § 102-311 et seq. 

Sec. 14-740. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  Title. This article shall be known as and may be cited as the Zion Sexually Oriented Business Licensing Ordinance, and is also referred to herein as this article. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the municipality in order to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the municipality. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content any communicative materials or communication, including sexually oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented entertainment protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is obscene. 
(c)  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses presented to the municipality from findings incorporated in the cases of City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 120 S.Ct. 1382 (2000); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. , 501 U.S. 560 (1991), City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc. , 475 U.S. 41 (1986) Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), Berg v. Health and Hospital Corporation, 865 F.2d 797 (7th Cir 1989); Ellwest Stereo Theaters v. Wenner, 681 F.2d 1243 (9th Cir. 1982); Bamon Corp v. City of Dayton , 730 F.Supp 80 (S.D. Ohio, 1990) and EWAP Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 97 Cal. App 3d 179, 158 Cal. Rptr. (1979), and on studies in other cities including the Report of the Attorney Genera's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (Minnesota, 1989); Memorandum re: Adult Entertainment Ordinance , of the Assistant Chief of Police of the Tucson, Arizona (May 1, 1990); Hecht, Peter R., Ph.D., Report to the American Center for Law and Justice on the Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses (March 31, 1996); Adult Entertainment Businesses in Indianapolis, An Analysis (1984) and McCleary, Richard, Ph.D. and Meeker, James W., Ph.D., Final Report to the City of Garden Grove: The Relationship Between Crime and Adult Business Operations on Garden Grove Boulevard , (Garden Grove, CA, October 23, 1991), this Legislative body finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities. 
(2)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral sex and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually oriented entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
(3)  Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions. 
(4)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate those activities and maintain their facilities. 
(5)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented films concealed from public view. 
(6)  The findings noted in section 14-740(c)(1) through (5) raise compelling and substantial governmental concerns. 
(7)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those compelling and substantial governmental concerns. 
(8)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the municipality. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(9)  The regulation of nudity, semi-nudity, and physical contact between employees and patrons in sexually oriented businesses will further the compelling and substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and other sex-related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(10)  Requiring open sight lines in sexually oriented businesses and requiring sufficient lighting will advance the compelling and substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually oriented businesses and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this article and other federal, state and local laws, thereby furthering the compelling and substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(11)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented businesses, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this article and other federal, state and local laws, and will thereby further the compelling and substantial government interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(12)  A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually oriented business. 
(13)  Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

ARTICLE VI. - SANITARY SEWER 

Sec. 26-176. - System generally. 
(a)  Generally. It is the intent of this article to provide for the safe and efficient disposal of sanitary sewerage. It is the intent of this article that the public health be protected from the negative aspects of sanitary sewage by the proper separation of sanitary sewage from the environment until such time that it is rendered harmless. All developments shall include a sanitary sewerage system meeting the approval of the director of public works, the superintendent of water and sewer, and the North Shore Sanitary District. Sanitary sewer systems shall be constructed in accordance with Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois unless otherwise modified in this section. 
(b)  Service area. All sanitary sewers shall be designed to accommodate an ultimate service area as identified by the director of public works and the superintendent of water and sewer in consultation with the North Shore Sanitary District. If extending the ultimate service area beyond the limits of the proposed development results in additional construction costs within the development, the city may provide an agreement for the recapture by the developer or owner of the additional cost when future system extensions are made. Recapture payments will be made to the developer or owner only after those benefiting from the extended service area have made payment to the city. The North Shore Sanitary District shall not take part in any recapture arrangements. 
(c)  Extensions. The location of proposed extensions to the existing sanitary sewerage system shall be approved by the director of public works and the superintendent of water and sewer. 
(d)  Design standards. 
(1)  Design flows for residential developments, single and multiple shall be based upon full development of the service area with the population served. Design flow assumptions shall be subject to the approval of the director of public works and the superintendent of water and sewer. 
(2)  The formula to be used for residential developments to determine the maximum daily per capita design flow is as follows: 
Q(max.) 18 + ? ;mb=2q; P Q(avg.)  4 + ? ;mb=2q; P  
Where: 
Q = Design flow, gpcpd 
P = Population served in thousands 
(3)  Design flows for nonresidential developments shall be based on full development of the service area with the daily average design flow calculated as follows: 
Q = (0.10)(A f ) 
Where: 
Q = Design flow, gpd 
A f =Floor area in square feet 
or 
Q = (1500)(A;sub§\sub;) 
Where 
Q = Design flow, gpd

(a)  The developer or owner shall have a qualified person approved by the director of public works and the superintendent of water and sewer in charge and on site at all times that construction of the water distribution system is underway. The developer or owner shall be fully responsible for the quality of the materials and methods of the construction work and shall bear full responsibility for ensuring that the water distribution system shall meet the requirements of the city in every way. 
(b)  The director of public works and the superintendent of water and sewer shall inspect the water distribution system under construction, during construction, as they deem necessary. The director of public works and the superintendent of water and sewer shall not be responsible to direct the work of the contractor but shall be responsible only to assess the acceptability of the improvement as constructed. In no case shall the director of public works nor the superintendent of water and sewer be responsible for day-to-day quality control at the site of construction. 
(c)  The completed water mains and appurtenances of the water distribution system improvement shall be tested to the satisfaction of the director of public works and the superintendent of water and sewer. All newly laid water main shall be subjected to a hydrostatic pressure of 150 psi maintained for not less than one hour. Each valved section of pipe shall be filled with water, and the specified test pressure shall be applied by means of a pump connected to the pipe. Before applying the specified test pressure, all air shall be expelled from the pipe. All leaks shall be repaired until tight. Any cracked or defective pipes, fittings, valves or hydrants discovered shall be replaced and the test repeated until satisfactory results are obtained. 
(d)  Suitable means shall be provided for determining the amount of water lost to leakage under the specified test pressure. Allowable leakage shall not exceed that computed as follows: 
;mb=6q 
mb=0; ;mb=6q;=;mb=0; (N)(D) ? ;mb=2q; P 7400  
L = Allowable leakage in gallons per hour 
N = Number of joints in test section 
D = Nominal diameter of pipe in inches 
P = Average pressure at lowest point in the line under test corrected to the gauge elevation 
"Leakage" is defined as the quantity of water required to be supplied to the newly laid pipe per hour to maintain the test pressure. Water shall be added each time pressure in the main drops to 140 pounds to bring line pressure back up to 150 pounds. Gauge readings shall take into account any differences in elevation between gauge and water main under test.

Sec. 26-207. - Disinfection. 
(a)  All water mains shall be disinfected and tested according to the requirements of the Standards for Disinfecting Water Mains, AWWA C651, and as required in this section. All disinfection shall be performed by an independent firm with experience in the methods and techniques of this operation. The choice of firm shall be subject to the approval of the superintendent of water and sewer. 
(b)  The chlorinating agent shall be introduced at the beginning of the pipeline extension or any valved section of it through a corporation stop in the top of the newly laid pipe. The water injector for delivering the chlorine gas into the pipe shall be supplied from a tap on the pressure side of the gate valve controlling the flow of water into the pipeline extension. 
(c)  Water from the existing distribution system or other source of supply shall be controlled so it flows slowly into the newly laid pipe during the application of the chlorine gas. The rate of water entering the pipe that the chlorine dose applied to the water entering the newly laid pipe shall be at least 50 ppm or enough to meet the requirements during the retention period. This may require as much as 100 ppm of chlorine in the water in the line at the time of chlorination. 
(d)  The valves shall be adjusted so that the chlorine solution in the line being treated will not flow back into the line supplying the water. 
(e)  Treated water shall remain in the pipe for at least 24 hours. The chlorine residual at the pipe extremities and at other representative points shall then be measured to be 25 ppm or more. If the amount of residual chlorine is too low, the pipeline extension shall be re-chlorinated. 
(f)  All valves or other appurtenances in the newly laid pipe shall be operated while the pipe is full of chlorinating agent. 
(g)  After chlorination, the pipeline extension shall be thoroughly flushed until the replacement water is approved as safe by the superintendent of water and sewer. The water shall be tested through the use of one day samples. Test samples shall be drawn by the contractor under the supervision of the public works department. Chlorination and testing shall continue until satisfactory results are obtained. 
(h)  The cost of flushing, disinfection, sampling and testing shall be borne by the owner or developer.

Names of new streets and avenues shall not duplicate existing or platted street or avenue names unless a new street or avenue is a continuation of or in alignment with existing or platted streets or avenues; in which event, they shall bear the same name of the existing or platted street or avenue. The names of all new streets or avenues shall be subject to the prior approval of the building department. 
(e)  Where un-subdivided land adjoins the proposed subdivision, provision shall be made where practicable for the extension of streets into such un-subdivided area. Such provision may include leaving vacant land which would be required to extend such streets to this area; or, where the subdivision of such area can be foreseen in the near future, this provision may include street construction to the boundary of such area. 
(f)  Half streets are prohibited except where the plan commission finds that the land adjoining a half street is unsubdivided and that it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half of such street at such time as the adjoining land is subdivided. Where a half street is approved by the plan commission, both halves of such street shall be platted on the plat of the proposed subdivision. 
(g)  Where a tract is subdivided into parcels larger than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow the opening of future streets and further re-subdivision in a logical and orderly manner. 
(h)  Where a proposed subdivision abuts on or contains an existing primary or major street or expressway, or other comparable techniques may be required by the plan commission where necessary to separate through traffic from local traffic and to protect residential properties. 
(i)  Where a proposed subdivision contains a railroad right-of-way, public utility right-of-way or limited-access highway right-of-way, the plan commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way or where the proposed subdivision abuts such right-of-way, on that side of such right-of-way. Such parallel street shall be located at a distance permitting the appropriate use of intervening land for park purposes in residential districts or for commercial, business or industrial purposes in commercial, business or industrial districts as the case may be.

(1)  Every notice of participation must be filed with the city clerk before the adjournment of the first day of public hearing. In the case of counsel of record for any participant, said counsel shall, on or before the 80th day from the date of filing, serve a letter upon the city clerk and upon counsel for the applicant entering his or her appearance for the participant. 
(2)  Every notice of participation shall provide the following information: the name, address daytime phone number and, if available, facsimile number of the participant or counsel; whether the participant will be participating on his/her own behalf or as a representative/spokesperson of another person or entity (and if on behalf of another person or entity, identify the name of that person or entity); whether the person (or the entity or association he/she represents) will be represented by an attorney during the public hearings; and whether the person intends on providing oral testimony or comment during the public hearing. All members of the public who desire to present sworn testimony, unsworn comment, or submit written questions to the hearing officer must file a notice of participation. 
(3)  No person may become a participant after the first day of the hearing except for good cause shown. The hearing officer shall liberally interpret this limitation if the additional participation shall not delay the process or unfairly prejudice a prior participant. No late participant shall be entitled to re-call a witness who has previously testified. 
(d)  Participant rights. Participants have the right to present sworn testimony and witnesses.

i.  Allow the introduction of late-filed evidence, be it written or testimonial, on behalf of any participant, provided good cause is shown for the late-filing, the evidence is offered in and is relevant to the rebuttal portion of the applicant's or participant's case, and evidence was filed with the city clerk at least one day before the public hearing at which it is offered, and fundamental fairness to all parties will be preserved. 
j.  The hearing officer shall be an attorney, licensed to practice in Illinois. The hearing officer shall confer with the city council concerning the petition, between the date of filing of the petition and the council's decision on the petition. Given the hearing officer's role of communicating with the city council, the hearing officer may not confer with the participants (members of the public, applicant and city included) concerning the petition, unless such conference takes place during the public hearing, is through correspondence which is filed with the city clerk (and, thus, available for everyone to view), or concerns location, time or other similar scheduling aspects of the public meeting or public hearing, or the notices for same. The only additional exception from this restriction is that the hearing officer may confer with the city clerk about the upkeep or status of the public record, make a request to review or copy the public record, or confer with the city clerk regarding the scheduling or location of the public meeting or hearing, or arrangements for the notices of the public meeting and hearing. 
k.  At the conclusion of the public hearing and after consideration of all timely-filed written comments, the hearing officer shall submit draft written findings (of law or fact) to the city council and file a copy of such findings with the city clerk.

Upon the close of all such testimony, the city may present sworn testimony, including witnesses and evidence it may wish to present. The hearing officer, in the exercise of his or her discretion, may then permit rebuttal testimony and sur-rebuttal testimony. 
k.  All witnesses shall testify under oath and be subject to reasonable questioning as follows: direct examination by counsel; cross-examination by counsel for other participants or the city staff, the city council and/or the hearing officer (including the use of written questions submitted by the public to the hearing officer); redirect examination; re-cross examination. 
l.  Following the testimony outlined in subparagraph (j) above, any participant not represented by counsel that wishes to provide sworn testimony subject to cross-examination by others may proceed.

Likewise, the applicant, city staff, the city attorney and/or any participant may file draft proposed findings of fact within the same time limitation. 
b.  The city clerk, on behalf of the city council, shall receive written comment or draft findings of fact and the clerk shall date stamp same, shall serve copies of the same on counsel for the applicant and counsel for the city, city staff and counsel of record for all participants; and shall file written comment and the postmarked envelope in which comment is received. 
c.  Copies of such written comments shall be made available for public inspection in the offices of the city clerk, and members of the public shall be allowed to obtain a copy of any written comment upon payment of actual cost of reproduction. 
d.  Any written comment received by the city clerk or postmarked not later than 30 days after the date of the last public hearing shall be made part of the record at the public hearing as hereinafter described and the city council shall consider any such timely written comments in making its final determination concerning said petition.

(6)  Storage of materials; or 
(7)  Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface waters. 
"Development" does not include maintenance of existing buildings and facilities such as reroofing; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not involve filling, grading, or construction of levees. 
    Flood means a general and temporary condition of inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Floodway means that portion of the SFHA required to store and convey the base flood. The floodway for the SFHA Kellogg Creek shall be as delineated on the flood boundary and floodway map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated January 16, 1981. The floodway for each of the remaining SFHAs of the city shall be according to the best data available to the state water survey floodplain information repository. 
    FPE or flood protection elevation means the elevation of the base flood plus one foot at any given location in the SFHA. 
    Riverine SFHA means any SFHA subject to flooding from a river, creek, intermittent stream, ditch, or any other identified channel. This term does not include areas subject to flooding from lakes (except public bodies of water), ponding areas, areas of sheet flow, or other areas not subject to overbank flooding. 
    SFHA or special flood hazard area means those lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are subject to inundation by the base flood. The SFHAs of the city are generally identified as such on the flood insurance rate map of the city prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated January 16, 1981. The SFHAs of the unincorporated parts of the county that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city or that may be annexed into the city are generally identified as such on the flood insurance rate map prepared for the county by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated November 3, 1982.

(c)  The city attorney shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended. 
(d)  Nothing in this section shall prevent the city from taking any other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the persons responsible.

Additionally, a copy of the notice shall be served on the occupants of the structure if that person is different than the owner. In the event that notice is not possible as set further above, a copy of the notice shall be posted at the property if ten days have elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice to the owner and no response or reply has been received by the city from the owner or person in charge. 
(2)  The failure of any person in charge to receive notice that the property is a chronic nuisance property shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the proceedings under this subsection.

(2)  In an action pursuant to this subsection, the city shall have the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is a chronic nuisance property. 
(3)  It is an affirmative defense to an action seeking the closure of chronic nuisance property that the owner of the property, at the time in question, could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the property had become a public nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, control the nuisance activity leading to the findings that the property is a chronic nuisance property. 
(g)  Injunctive relief and remedies. 
(1)  In the event that the chief of police or director of building and/or director's designee determines that the property is an immediate threat to the public safety and welfare of the residents of the city, the city may apply to the court for such interim relief. In such an event, the city need not comply with the notification process set forth in subsection (c) of this section; however, the city shall make a diligent effort to notify the person in charge prior to any emergency court hearing. 
(2)  In the event the court finds the property constitutes a "chronic nuisance property" as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, the court may order the remedy set forth in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. Additionally, the court may assess a civil fine, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, in the event it finds that the person in charge had knowledge of the nuisance activities at the subject property and permitted the nuisance activities to occur and/or continue. 
(3)  The court may authorize the city to physically secure the property against use or occupancy, in the event the owner fails to do so within the time specified by the court. In the event the city is authorized to secure the property, all costs incurred by the city to affect a closure shall be assessed as a lien against the property. If used herein, "costs" means those expenses actually incurred by the city for physically securing the property. 
(4)  The city shall prepare a statement of the cost and shall thereafter submit said statement to the court for its review. If no objection to the statement, the court may order that a lien in said amount may be recorded against the property.

    Electronic signs may be otherwise known as a digital sign, electronic message center (EMC), electronic message display signs (EMD), animated sign, changeable sign and LED sign. It is the intent of this section to include all types of electronic/digital signs regardless of the name of the sign. Types of electronic/digital signs for the purpose of this section are identified as follows:  Static Display (Message Changed with no Transition)  Static Display (Fade/Dissolve Transitions)  Static Display (Travel/Scroll Transitions and Animations)  Full Animation, Flashing, Video 
(1)  Definitions. 
(a)  Animated sign. A sign employing actual motion, the illusion of motion, or light and/or color changes achieved through mechanical, electrical, or electronic means. 
    Electrically activated. Animated signs producing the illusion of movement by means of electronic, electrical, or electromechanical input and/or illumination capable of simulating movement through employment of the characteristics of one or both of the classifications noted below: 
1.  Flashing. Animated signs or animated portions of signs whose illumination is characterized by a repetitive cycle in which the period of illumination is either the same as or less than the period of non-illumination. For the purposes of this section, flashing will not be defined as occurring if the cyclical period between on-off phases of illumination exceeds four seconds. 
2.  Patterned illusionary movement. Animated signs or animated portions of signs whose illumination is characterized by simulated movement through alternate or sequential activation of various illuminated elements for the purpose of producing repetitive light patterns designed to appear in some form of constant motion. 
(b)  Changeable sign. A sign with the capability of content change by means of remote input, includes the following types: 
    Electrically activated. Changeable sign whose message copy or content can be changed by means of remote electrically energized on-off switching combinations of alphabetic or pictographic components arranged on a display surface. Illumination may be integral to the components, such as characterized by lamps or other light-emitting devices; or it may be from an external light source designed to reflect off the changeable component display. See also electronic message center . 
(c)  Electronic message display. A sign capable of displaying words, symbols, figures or images that can be electronically or mechanically changed by remote or automatic means, including animated graphics and video. 
(d)  Dissolve. A mode of message transition on an electronic message display accomplished by varying the light intensity or pattern, where the first message gradually appears to dissipate and lose legibility simultaneously with the gradual appearance and legibility of the second message. 
(e)  Display time. The amount of time a message and/or graphic is displayed on an electronic message sign. 
(f)  Dynamic frame effect. An electronic message sign frame effect in which the illusion of motion and/or animation is used. 
(g)  Electronic message center or sign (EMC). An electrically activated changeable sign whose variable message and/or graphic presentation capability can be electronically programmed by computer from a remote location. Also known as an EMC. EMCs typically use light emitting diodes (LEDs) as a lighting source. (See also following terms principally associated with electronic message centers: display time, dissolve, dynamic frame effect, fade, frame, frame effect, scroll, transition, travel ). 
(h)  Fade. A mode of message transition on an electronic message display accomplished by varying the light intensity, where the first message gradually reduces intensity to the point of not being legible and the subsequent message gradually increases intensity to the point of legibility. 
(i)  Font. A set of letters, numerals, symbols, or shapes conforming to a specific set of design criteria. 
(j)  Foot candle. An English unit of measurement of the amount of light falling upon a surface (illuminance). One foot candle is equal to one lumen per square foot. Can be measured by means of an illuminance meter. 
(k)  Foot lambert. An English unit of measurement of the amount of light emitted by or reflecting off a surface (luminance) equivalent to 3.4262591 candelas per square meter. 
(l)  Frame. A complete, static display screen on an electronic message sign. 
(m)  Frame effect A visual effect on an electronic message display applied to a single frame to attract the attention of viewers. 
(n)  Scroll. A mode of message transition on an electronic message display where the message appears to move vertically across the display surface. 
(o)  Transition. A visual effect used on an electronic message display to change from one message to another. 
(p)  Travel. A mode of message transition on an electronic message display where the message appears to move horizontally across the display surface. 
(2)  Zoning/location/placement/requirements. 
    Electronic/digital signs may be permitted [with the approval of a special use permit] in all zoning districts other than residential subject to the following requirements: 
(a)  Operational limitations. Such displays shall contain static messages only, and shall not have movement, or the appearance or optical illusion of movement, of any part of the sign structure, design, or pictorial segment of the sign, including the movement or appearance of movement of any illumination or the flashing, scintillating or varying of light intensity. 
(b)  Minimum display time. Each message on the sign must be displayed for a minimum of 8 seconds. 
(c)  Message change sequence. A minimum of 0.3 seconds of time with no message displayed shall be provided between each message displayed on the sign. Fading in or out is not permitted. 
(d)  All EMC signs shall have automatic dimming controls, either by photocell (hardwired) or via software settings. From 1/2 hour before sunset to sunrise, EMC signs shall not exceed a maximum luminance level of 500 nits. During daylight hours maximum luminance shall not exceed 5,000 nits. 
(e)  If a sign malfunctions, it must "go dark" until the issue is resolved. 
(f)  Flashing is never allowed. 
(g)  All other functions as listed under "Definitions" must be approved during the special use permit hearing and will include timing, speeds, etc. Approval or denial will be based upon, but not be limited to, the following: location, sign placement, sign size, possible traffic distraction, and quality of life for adjoining residential properties.

Cross reference- Comprehensive plan, § 66-76 et seq. 
Sec. 82-78. - Land subject to flooding. 
(a)  No land subject to periodic flooding or which lacks drainage adequate for maintaining clear streets shall be subdivided for residential use or any other use incompatible with such flooding or drainage characteristics. 
(b)  Where the owner or subdivider of land which is subject to periodic flooding or such inadequate drainage agrees to install at his own expense improvements meeting the standards and requirements of the city and the North Shore Sanitary District, designed so as to render such land safe for residential or other intended occupancy, then and only in that event the provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not bar the approval of such subdivision for such intended use.

Cross reference- Floods, ch. 38. 
Sec. 82-79. - Street layout and design. 
(a)  Comprehensive plan, official map, etc. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the comprehensive plan and official map of the city and shall be considered in relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and to their relation to proposed uses of the land served by such streets. Where the comprehensive plan or official map are not relevant to streets of the proposed subdivision, the arrangement and design standards of such streets shall conform to all applicable provisions of any other ordinances of the city. 
(b)  Existing streets. Street arrangements in new and proposed subdivisions shall make provision for the extension of existing streets into the area proposed to be subdivided, where practicable. 
(c)  Adjoining unsubdivided land. Where unsubdivided land adjoins the proposed subdivision, provision shall be made, where practicable, for the extension of streets into such unsubdivided area. Such provision may include leaving vacant land which would be required to extend such streets to this area; or, where the subdivision of such area can be foreseen in the near future, this provision may include street construction to the boundary of such area. 
(d)  Half streets. Half streets are prohibited except where the plan commission finds that the land adjoining such half street is unsubdivided and that it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half of such street at such time as the adjoining land is subdivided. Where a half street is approved by the plan commission, both halves of such street shall be platted on the plat of the proposed subdivision. 
(e)  Large parcels. Where a tract is subdivided into parcels larger than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow the opening of future streets and further resubdivision in a logical and orderly manner. 
(f)  Marginal access streets. Where a proposed subdivision abuts on or contains an existing primary or major street or expressway, marginal access streets or other comparable techniques may be required by the plan commission where necessary to separate through traffic from local traffic and to protect residential properties. 
(g)  Parallel streets. Where a proposed subdivision contains a railroad right-of-way, public utility right-of-way, or limited-access highway right-of-way, the plan commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, or where the proposed subdivision abuts such right-of-way, on that side of such right-of-way. Such parallel street shall be located at a distance permitting the appropriate use of intervening land for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial, business or industrial purposes in commercial, business or industrial districts, as the case may be. This distance shall also be sufficient to provide for suitable approach grades and future grade separations with respect to such street and such right-of-way. Where such right-of-way is under the jurisdiction of the division of highways of the state, or the county department of highways, respecting maintenance and upkeep thereof, entrances to such right-of-way from such parallel street shall not be approved by the plan commission unless the subdivider has submitted to the director of engineering and the plan commission a written permit issued by such division or department approving the construction of such entrances. 
(h)  Access by property owners. No strip or area of land in a proposed subdivision shall be reserved along any portion of a street, half street or alley where the effect thereof prevents access to such street, half street or alley by adjacent property owners.

Permanent dead-end streets shall not be longer than 660 feet and shall be provided at the closed end thereof with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least 70 feet and a right-of-way diameter of at least 100 feet. Where a dead-end street is of a temporary nature, awaiting its extension into adjoining land, a similar turnaround shall be provided, except that all land in excess of that needed for such street when extended shall be subject to a temporary easement allowing such turnaround, but terminating when such extension is made. 
(j)  Minor streets. Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by traffic will be discouraged. 
(k)  Widths. Minimum widths for street rights-of-way shall conform to the following schedule: 
(1) Major or primary streets ..... 80' to 100' (located in accordance with comprehensive plan) (2) Secondary or collector streets ..... 66' to 80' (located in accordance with comprehensive plan) (3) Marginal access streets ..... 40' (4) Minor streets ..... 66' (5) Cul-de-sac streets ..... 60'  
(6)  Where streets adjoin areas zoned for commercial, business or industrial use, or where a petition for a change in zoning is contemplated to permit commercial, business or industrial use, the above street widths shall be increased by the amount necessary to provide for the free flow of through traffic without interference from parked or parking vehicles and to provide for safe parking space for such commercial, business and industrial uses. 
(l)  Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be avoided. 
(m)  Intersections generally. The intersection of more than two streets at one point shall be avoided except where otherwise impractical to secure a proper street system. Streets shall intersect one another at an angle as near to a right angle as possible and in no event shall such intersection be at angles of less than 60 degrees. Street intersections shall be rounded with a minimum radius of 20 feet measured at the back of the curbs where such intersections are right angle intersections. If an intersection occurs at other than a right angle, it shall be rounded with a curve of a radius acceptable to the plan commission. 
(n)  Sight distance. When connecting streets deflect from each other at any point by more than 30 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 200 feet, and of such greater radii as the plan commission shall determine for special cases. The location and profile of such streets shall give a clear sight distance of at least 300 feet for all primary streets, and 200 feet for all other streets. 
(o)  Names. The several streets and avenues in the city shall be known and designated by the names adopted by the ordinances in force, as shown on the official map, together with all amendments and revisions thereof.

Prior to inclusion of said Ord. No. 2003-O-21, Art. VI pertained to similar subject matter. Subsequently, Ord. No. 04-O-32, § 2, adopted Sept. 21, 2004, amended Art. VI, in its entirety, to read as herein set out in §§ 82-156-82-162, Exhs. A-C. See also the Code Comparative Table. 

Sec. 82-156. - Dedication of school and park sites required. 
    As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a final plat of a planned unit development, land for park and recreational purposes and land for school sites, or cash contributions in lieu of land, or a combination of both, at the option of the city, shall be provided to serve those needs specifically and uniquely attributable to the residents of the subdivision or planned unit development. 
    This land or cash or combination thereof shall be provided in accordance with the following criteria and formula: 
(a)  Criteria for park and recreational land requirements. 
(1)  Land requirement and population ratio. The amount of land required for dedication for park and recreational purposes shall be a direct function of the ultimate population density of a proposed development. The maximum requirement shall be ten acres of land per 1,000 persons of ultimate population computed in accordance with the Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit, which is attached hereto as Exhibit A. 
(2)  Location. The location and configuration of the site to be dedicated shall be determined by the city council upon recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and in consultation with the Zion Park District, which shall take into account the comprehensive plan of the city, the suitability of the site for park purposes or development, its relationship to population concentrations and its proximity to other park or recreational lands. Donated land should be reasonably accessible to all residential lots within the impacted area. 
(3)  Minimum size, topography, soils, improvements and landscaping. 
a.  Minimum size. The minimum size of land to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes shall be no less than five acres, one dimension of which cannot be less than 100 feet. However, the planning and zoning commission may recommend and the city council may approve, after consultation with the Zion Park District, dedications of smaller sizes, when required by the specific plans of the development and when the usefulness of the smaller area for park and recreational purposes is demonstrated. 
b.  Topography and soils. 
1.  The site must be graded to meet topography and to meet existing drainage patterns. 
2.  At least 80 percent of the donated land for park and recreational purposes shall be suitable in topography and soil types for recreational facilities. 
3.  The soil shall allow construction of recreational facilities and have a soil bearing capacity to support recreational facilities. Recreational facilities are defined as: 
Buildings and other physical features set aside in a park site that are used by participants of the community. Examples of recreational facilities include, but are not limited to, a swimming pool complex, playground picnic shelter, picnic sites, baseball/softball field, football/soccer field, various games activity courts, tennis court, basketball court, volleyball court, restroom/storage building, community center and waterfront area. 
c.  Improvements and landscaping. 
1.  Each park site shall have sanitary and storm sewer, water, electricity, and gas available at the property lines of the dedicated site when these utilities are required in the subdivision. 
2.  A designated paved parking area with curbing not to exceed nine spaces and one handicapped space for a total of ten spaces, and located in close proximity to a dedicated street shall be provided in park sites over one acre. 
3.  Landscaping. The park site shall be seeded. All seeding shall be of an acceptable strand of grass suitable for recreational uses to meet Zion Park District specifications. A determination shall be made by the Zion Park District on the type of seed to be planted and said determination shall be reached prior to final plat approval. A minimum of six trees per acre, at least two and one-half inches in caliper measured at breast height, shall be planted. A determination by the Zion Park District of tree numbers shall be made prior to final plat approval. Under no condition shall trees prohibited by the subdivision or zoning ordinance be permitted. 
(4)  Use of wetlands and detention areas for dedications and environmental quality. Wetlands and detention areas for storm water control shall not normally qualify as land for park and recreational purposes, but may be approved if an acceptable recreational use can be demonstrated or the area offers an exceptional amenity or the chance to protect a significant natural resource. Wetlands and detention areas shall not be approved without the prior written consent of the Zion Park District. 
No site that has been part of an unlicensed landfill or a toxic waste dump shall be acceptable for park and recreational purposes. 
(5)  Private open spaces and recreational areas. Land for park and recreational purposes shall not be privately owned and maintained unless specifically approved by the city council. The city council or staff shall approve the detailed plans for all improvements for such park and recreational land which is privately owned and maintained. Guarantees of the permanency of the use, maintenance and public access of such privately owned and maintained park and recreational open space, satisfactory to the city staff, shall be entered into by the subdivider. The guarantees may include covenants and/or express provisions in the declaration of condominium and by-laws or declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions and/or by-laws of a homeowner's association. 
(6)  Criteria for a fully developed park. A fully developed park, including appropriate lighting, grading, landscaping, and recreational equipment, may be required when the availability of land for park land is limited and where the recreational needs of the residents of the subdivision can be satisfied with a smaller but fully developed park with a more intensive activity level. The expense for the dedication and improvement of a fully developed park shall not exceed the contributions in lieu thereof required as set forth below. 
(b)  Criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of park sites. Where the development is small and the resulting land dedication is too small to be practical, or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes, as determined by the city council, the subdivider shall pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land required. 
(1)  Cash contribution in lieu of park and recreational land dedication. The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreational land dedications shall be solely for use in the acquisition of park and recreational land. The cash contributions shall be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of any existing local park and recreational land which already serves such needs. 
(2)  Fair market value. The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on the "fair market value" of the acres of land in the area that otherwise would have been dedicated as a park and recreational site. The fair market value, on a per acre basis, shall assume that the land is zoned residential, subdivided, stubbed with city sewer and water, has all appropriate utilities available, is improved and is otherwise property capable of being used for residential development. Based upon a study of real estate transactions in Lake County for the past three years, it has been determined that the present fair market value of such improved land in and surrounding the city as of the effective date of this article is $50,000.00 per acre. This figure shall be reviewed annually by the city council based on real estate transactions and any other indicators as to value. The fair market value, as defined above, shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land contribution herein unless timely objected to as provided in this article. Objections to the fair market value, as defined above, shall be made in accordance with the requirements of this article. Failure to timely object to the fair market value, as defined above, in accordance with the provisions of this article shall constitute a waiver of any right to raise an objection at a later time. The value per acre for park land has been set less than the value per acre for school sites as the city council finds that park land is often not situated in as desirable of a location as school sites and that the topography and condition may be such that it is not considered in as prime of a condition for construction as would be necessary for school sites. 
(3)  Refund of cash contributions. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and recreational land dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth herein 20 years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the subdivider who made such contributions. 
(4)  Criteria for requiring dedication and contribution in lieu of park land. A combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land shall be required, when: 
a.  The subdivision or development does not have sufficient or adequate land to meet the dedication requirements hereunder. That portion of the land within the subdivision or development which is adequate or sufficient for the park location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated; or 
b.  A major part of the local park or recreational site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision or development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required. 
(5)  Requirement and population ratio for cash contribution in lieu of land. The ultimate number of residents to be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly on the amount of land required to be dedicated for park sites. The determination of the number of residents to be generated from a particular development or lot shall be based on data published in the Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit, attached hereto as Exhibit A. 
A bedroom, as used in this article, shall include any den, study, or extra room located on any floor in a dwelling unit which is not clearly identified for some other specific purpose, other than a kitchen (one per unit), dining room (one per unit), living room (one per unit), bathroom, and family room (one per unit). 
In the event a subdivider files a written objection to Exhibit A, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development. Exhibit A shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land contribution herein, unless objected to as provided in this article. Failure to object to Exhibit A in accordance with the provisions of this article shall thereafter constitute a waiver of any right to raise an objection at a later time. 
(6)  Calculation of cash in lieu of land requirement. In order to calculate the cash in lieu of land requirement the estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit shall be multiplied by the land requirement and population ratio, as stated in section (a)(1) above, which shall be multiplied by the fair market value per acre as stated in (b)(2) above. The resulting product shall be the required cash contribution. 
(c)  Criteria for dedication of school sites or payment of fees in lieu thereof. The amount of land required for dedication for school purposes, a cash contribution in lieu of a land dedication, or a combination of both shall be a direct function of the ultimate population density of a proposed development. Whether a land donation, cash donation or combination of both is required shall be determined by the city with the concurrence of the affected school district. The donation shall be made in accordance with the following criteria: 
(1)  Criteria for requiring school site dedication. 
a.  Requirement and population ratio. The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly on the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The determination of the number of students to be generated from a particular development or lot shall be based on data published in the Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit, attached hereto as Exhibit A. 
A bedroom, as used in this article, shall include any den, study, or extra room located on any floor in a dwelling unit which is not clearly identified for some other specific purpose, other than a kitchen (one per unit), dining room (one per unit), living room (one per unit), bathroom, and family room (one per unit). 
In the event a subdivider files a written objection to Exhibit A, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development. Exhibit A shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land contribution herein, unless objected to as provided in this article. Failure to object to Exhibit A in accordance with the provisions of this article shall constitute a waiver of any right to raise an objection at a later time. 
b.  School classification and size of school site. School classifications and size of school sites within the city shall be determined in accordance with the table attached as Exhibit B. The requirements for acreage contained in Exhibit B are based upon a review of available data, studies and literature on the subject, including, but not limited to, information provided by the state superintendent of education and the unique characteristics of Lake County and the desire of its residents to maintain this character in their future school sites. These requirements for acreage shall be presumed as the appropriate acreage requirements and shall be used in calculating any contribution herein, unless timely objected to as provided in this article. Failure to timely object to the acreage requirements in accordance with the provisions of this article shall constitute a waiver of any right to raise an objection at a later time. 
c.  Land dedication requirement. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by multiplying the estimated children to be served in each such school classification calculated pursuant to Exhibit A by the appropriate number of acres per student contained in Exhibit B. The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increase in number of children in each such school classification. 
d.  Location. The comprehensive school plan and/or the standards adopted by the affected school district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. 
(2)  Criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of school sites. 
a.  Cash contribution. When the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for a school site, the city, with the concurrence of the affected school district, shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication. The number of students per dwelling unit shall be calculated as provided in section (1)a, above, regarding requirement and population ratio. 
b.  Fair market value. The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on the "fair market value" of the acres of land in the area that otherwise would have been dedicated as a school site. The fair market value, on a per acre basis, shall assume that the land is zoned residential, subdivided, stubbed with city sewer and water, has all appropriate utilities available, is improved and is otherwise property capable of being used for residential development. Based upon a study of real estate transactions in Lake County for the past three years, it has been determined that the present fair market value of such improved land, which is appropriate for a school site, in and surrounding the city as of the effective date of this article is $75,000.00 per acre. This figure shall be reviewed annually by the city council based on real estate transactions and any other indicators as to value. The fair market value, as defined above, shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land contribution herein unless timely objected to as provided in of this article. Failure to timely object to the fair market value, as defined above, in accordance with the provisions of this article shall constitute waiver of any right to raise an objection at a later time. 
c.  Cash contribution calculation. In order to calculate the cash in lieu of school site requirement, the estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit found at Exhibit A shall be used to determine the number of students. The number of students per dwelling unit shall be multiplied by acreage per student generated found at Exhibit B which shall be multiplied by the fair market value per acre as stated in (2)b. above. The resulting product shall be the required cash contribution. 
(3)  Refund of cash contributions. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of school site dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth herein 20 years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the subdivider who made such contributions. 
(4)  Topography and grading. The slope, topography and geology of any dedicated site, as well as its surroundings must be suitable for the building of school facilities. Wetlands, floodplains, floodways and land which serves as a component of any storm water control or retention system shall not be acceptable land donations. Land burdened by highway easements or any other type of easements or encroachment also shall not be an acceptable land donation. 
(5)  Improved sites. All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electrical, water, sewer, and streets (including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter), as applicable to the location of the site, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of the city's subdivision regulations. At the discretion of the city council, the landscaping normally included within the definition of "improved" sites under the city's subdivision regulations may be omitted due to the delay time between dedication of any such school site and the construction of school facilities thereon. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-32, § 2, 9-21-04) 
Sec. 82-157. - Donation of capital costs for the building of school facilities. 
    In addition to a land dedication, or any donation of cash in lieu thereof, the city shall further require that as a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, a planned unit development, or issuance of a building permit in the case of single lots, that the subdivider be required to make a donation to the school districts serving the development. These donations shall be made directly to the school districts and shall be used for the purpose of constructing school buildings and facilities necessary to educate the students generated by the development. 
(a)  Calculation of capital costs. The most recent data available at the time of the passage of this article from the Illinois School Consulting Service estimates that 100 square feet is required for each elementary school student, 150 square feet is required for each middle school student, and 160 square feet is required for each high school student. Illinois School Consulting Service further estimates that it costs $100.00 per square foot to construct school facilities. A table setting forth the capital donation, as allocated to each specific type of dwelling unit is attached hereto as Exhibit C. The amounts shown in Exhibit C shall be adjusted as deemed necessary by the city council based on reliable updated or additional information as to costs or square footage requirements. Any objection to the calculation of capital costs shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this article. The failure to object pursuant to this article shall constitute a waiver of any right to raise an objection at a later time. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-32, § 2, 9-21-04) 
Sec. 82-158. - Fire rescue department, library district and city land acquisition, capital improvement and equipment fees. 
    In order to defray land acquisition, capital improvement and equipment costs incurred by the Zion Fire Rescue Department and the Zion-Benton Public Library District which are specifically and uniquely attributable to the residential subdivisions and residential planned unit developments occurring within the city, the following land acquisition, capital improvement and equipment fees shall be paid to the city for the fire rescue department and directly to the library district at the time provided in this article. 
1.  Library land acquisition, capital improvement and equipment fee. $225.00 per dwelling unit regardless of the number of bedrooms. 
a.  The said library fee shall be used to acquire land to expand library facilities, to provide for the cost of construction for new library facilities to serve new residents, to upgrade existing facilities or to expand the collections of the library district. 
2.  Fire rescue, capital improvement and equipment fee. $500.00 per dwelling unit regardless of the number of bedrooms. 
a.  The fire rescue fee shall be used to acquire land for new fire stations, to construct new fire facilities, to upgrade existing facilities or to acquire new fire rescue equipment. 
3.  City land acquisition, capital improvement and equipment fee. $500.00 per dwelling unit regardless of the number of bedrooms. 
a.  The city fee shall be used to acquire land to expand municipal operations, to construct new municipal facilities, to upgrade existing facilities, to upgrade roadways to serve new development or to acquire equipment to serve and maintain the city's roads and other municipal infrastructure. 
    The fire rescue department, library district and city land acquisition, capital improvement and equipment fees shall be applicable to all residential subdivisions and planned unit developments unless other arrangements satisfactory to the library district and the city are made and written confirmation thereof is submitted to the city. 
    Any objection to either the fire rescue department, library district or city land acquisition, capital improvement or equipment fees shall be made prior to approval as provided in this article. The failure to timely object to these fees shall constitute a waiver of the right to object at a future time. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-32, § 2, 9-21-04) 
Sec. 82-159. - Objections. 
(a)  Procedure; timing. All objections relating to acreage requirements, presumptions as to fair market value, The Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit, calculation of capital costs or any other application of this article to a particular lot, subdivision or planned unit development, shall be referred to the city council for hearing. An objection must be made, if at all, prior to the approval by the city of the preliminary plat of subdivision or planned unit development. Where a plat of subdivision is not required, any objection must be made before the issuance of any building permit. A failure to object by such time shall constitute a waiver of the right to object to the provisions of this article. 
(1)  Form of objection. All objections shall be in writing and at a minimum contain the following information: 
a.  Specific identification of the exact data, calculation or other determination to which an objection is being made; 
b.  A detailed written basis for each and every objection made with specific reference to all data, written documentation, other evidence and/or testimony on which each and every objection is based; 
c.  A specific detailed statement setting forth the proper data, calculation or determination which the objector believes should be implemented under this article with specific and detailed reference to any data, documentary information, other evidence and/or oral testimony supporting said position or belief; 
d.  Copies of all data, and/or any other documentary evidence upon which the objector intends to rely; 
e.  Where any data is submitted, the objection shall make a specific reference as to the source of such data; 
f.  Where any studies performed by or on the behalf of the objector or any other source are submitted, the objector shall further submit detailed information concerning the methods and procedures used in the study to collect and analyze data; 
g.  Where any documentary or other evidence upon which the objector relies refers to other sources of information and/or back-up materials from which data or information was gathered, the objector shall provide copies of such back-up data and/or information; 
h.  A certification swearing that the objector has served, as applicable, full and complete copies of its objection upon the superintendent and business manager for each elementary and high school district and park district serving the development or property in question. If personal service is used the certification shall state: (1) the date upon which such personal service was made; (2) the home and business addresses of the individual making personal service; and (3) the identity and description of the individual to whom service was actually made. Where service is by certified mail return receipt requested the certification shall state the day and place on which such mailing was deposited with the U.S. post office and the name of the individual depositing same with the U.S. post office. The green card signifying receipt of notice by certified mail shall be delivered promptly to the city clerk upon receipt by the objector; 
i.  The legal and common description of the properties affected by the objection. 
(2)  Waiver of objections not made. The written objection shall contain each and every objection being made. Any objections which are not specifically set forth in this written objection shall forever be deemed waived and shall not be considered at the hearing. 
(3)  Variances in the form of the objection.

(4)  Procedure for making an objection. Eight copies of every objection shall be served upon the city clerk. If the objection is served on the city clerk ten or more business days before the next regularly scheduled council meeting, the objection shall be formally presented to the city council at its next regularly scheduled meeting. If the objection is served upon the city clerk less than ten business day before the city council's next regularly scheduled meeting, the objection shall be formally presented to the city council at the first regularly scheduled city council meeting which is ten or more days after the date the objection is received by the city clerk. When the city clerk receives an objection he or she shall notify the objector and the superintendent and business manager of each elementary and high school district and park district located within the city of the date at which the objection shall be formally presented to the city council. The objector and/or the objector's representative shall appear at the date scheduled for the presentment of the objection to the city council. If service of the objection on the superintendents and business managers of each elementary and high school district and park district located within the city was made by certified mail, the objector shall appear on said date and submit to the council proof that the objections were in fact received by such superintendents and business managers.

If any school or park district believes additional time is necessary, such district shall request same at the time the objection is formally presented to the council. The council may give the district more than 30 days to develop information in preparation for the hearing if the district can show good cause for such additional time. The factors to be considered in determining whether any school or park district has shown good cause include but are not limited to: (1) the length of the objection and the amount of supporting data contained in it; (2) whether all back-up data studies and reports have been submitted with the objection; (3) the district's need to undertake additional study or gather additional information to present to the council at the hearing; and (4) the complexity of the issues involved. 
(5)  Notice of hearing. At least once, not more than 14 nor less than seven calendar days before the hearing shall the objector publish in one or more newspapers published in the city, a notice setting forth the date, time and place for the scheduled hearing on the objection. The notice shall identify the nature of the objector's objection, the relief requested, identify the property or properties involved by both legal and common descriptions and invite any interested members of the public to attend and be heard. At the opening of the scheduled hearing the objector shall initially furnish to the council proof that it has complied with the requirements of this paragraph. 
(6)  Hearing. The hearing shall take place at a regularly scheduled city council meeting or other special meeting duly noticed and called for said purpose. The hearing shall take place on the date and time set by the council. The mayor shall preside over the hearing and render decisions on any testimonial and/or evidentiary questions that arise with the advice of the city attorney. The objector, the city and the school or park districts shall have the right to be represented by counsel and the right to present oral and documentary evidence to the council.

The council shall have the right to continue the hearing from time-to-time on its own motion or on the request of the objector and/or any district. The council shall deliberate in public and shall issue its written decision on each objection within 30 days of the conclusion of the hearing. The council may accept or reject the objector's position in whole or in part and its decision may have general or specific applicability. The determination of the council at the hearing shall be final. In the event any review of the council's determination is available under the laws of the State of Illinois, then the review shall be limited to the record and proceedings before the city council, unless the parties and the city agree otherwise. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-32, § 2, 9-21-04) 
Sec. 82-160. - Schedule of donations. 
    The cash in lieu of land contribution and capital cost donation imposed by this article shall be made by a certified or cashier's check payable directly to the applicable district and held by such district, according to the following schedule: 
(1)  Prior to the issuance of a building permit for each unit to be built, all cash in lieu of land donations and all capital cost donations relating to that unit shall be due and payable. 
(2)  In calculating the total amount of any cash in lieu of land contribution imposed by this article, the city shall use the fair market value of property in effect at the time of building permit issuance. In calculating the total capital cost contribution imposed by this article, the city shall use the capital costs in effect at the time of building permit issuance. 
(3)  For cash in lieu of land donations and capital cost donations payable, the applicable district shall issue a receipt for each lot or unit which shows that payment of the full cash in lieu of land donation and/or capital cost donation has been received. Each such receipt issued for donations received prior to the issuance of building permits shall identify the name of the builder/developer requesting the permit and specifically designate the subdivision and lot or unit to which the donation is referred. 
(4)  At the time the first donation is made, the subdivider shall provide to the applicable district a copy of the approved plat of subdivision or other document showing all lots which are proposed to be developed. In the event any amendments or changes are made to the approved plat of subdivision, the subdivider shall submit a revised plat of subdivision identifying all lots and showing all changes or revisions which have been made. The applicable districts shall use the plats of subdivision provided to mark off those lots for which the full cash donation has been paid. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-32, § 2, 9-21-04) 
Sec. 82-161. - General provisions 
(a)  Indemnification. As a precondition to any district's acceptance of site dedications, cash in lieu of land donations and capital costs or any other donations provided herein, the district receiving the donation shall execute an agreement indemnifying the city and holding it harmless from any damages and costs which arise out of any challenge to the validity of this article. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in absence of an indemnity agreement, acceptance of any site dedications, cash in lieu of land donations or capital costs donations shall be deemed acceptance of the obligation to indemnify the city as described above. 
(b)  Annexation. The dedication of land and cash contribution in lieu thereof and donation of capital costs required by this article shall also be required as a condition of the annexation of any platted subdivision or land to the city, and shall be incorporated in any pre-annexation or annexation agreement governing such land. However, the city reserves the right to negotiate dedications of land or cash in lieu of land and donations for capital costs which are greater than those set forth herein. 
(c)  Severability. If any provision of this article regarding the dedication of land or cash contribution in lieu thereof or the payment of capital costs or equipment fees or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such partial invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or applications of this article, the invalid provision shall be deemed stricken therefrom as if it were not a part hereof, ab initio, and the remainder of this article shall continue in full force and effect. 
(d)  Reservation of additional land. Where the comprehensive plan or standards of the city call for a larger amount of park and recreational land or school sites in a particular subdivision or development than the subdivider is required by this article to dedicate, the land needed in excess of the required dedication shall be reserved by the subdivider for subsequent acquisition at fair market value by the city or other public body designated by the city, provided that such acquisition is started within one year from the date of approval of the final plat. 
(e)  Combining with adjoining developments. Park or recreational land dedications and school site dedications may be combined with dedications from adjoining subdivisions and developments in order to produce usable recreational areas or school sites without hardship on a particular subdivider. 
(f)  Approval of final plat subject to dedication. Approval of any final plat of subdivision or any final planned unit development plat shall be conditioned upon the dedication of land or cash donations in lieu thereof as required by this article. The dedication of such land or cash in lieu thereof may be made at such other time as is specifically approved by the city council. 
(g)  On-site storage. No storage of any equipment and/or material, including spoil materials or top soil, shall be permitted on any land designated for park and recreational use or for school sites. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-32, § 2, 9-21-04) 
Sec. 82-162. - Donations required from properties outside city corporate limits. 
    In the event that land which is subject to subdivision or planned unit development approval by the city is not within the corporate limits of the city at the time of approval of a final plat of subdivision or planned unit development for the land, the provisions of this article shall not apply to said land with respect to contributions for city fire rescue services or in any other instance where the land is not within the jurisdiction of the governmental entity to which the contribution or donation is to be made. 
    However, in the event that land which is subject to subdivision approval by the city is not within the corporate limits of the city at the time of approval of a final plat of subdivision or planned unit development for the land, the governing body of any governmental entity which would be entitled to land and/or cash donations pursuant to this article, may request that the city vary the terms of this article by allowing said governmental entity to make its own agreement and/or waiver as to any or all of the donations and amounts thereof required in this article with the subdivider of said land. Said request shall be made in writing by a resolution adopted by the governing body of said governmental entity. In such an event, the city may, by ordinance, condition subdivision approval upon compliance with the provisions of this article as the provisions of this article have been modified by said variation and/or waiver. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-32, § 2, 9-21-04) 
Sec. 82-163. - Developer donations for certain health and elder care housing facilities. 
    It is the public policy of the city that certain of the developer donations required by section 82-163 of the City of Zion Code of Ordinance do not apply to health and elder care housing facilities as defined herein, for purposes of the Code of Ordinances, "health and elder care housing facilities" shall mean a multiple unit residential building with living units for residents which are age restricted by the by-laws, restrictive covenants, charter, or the like, for residents aged 60 and older. Health and elder care housing facilities shall also have available health or medical care to the residents by providing facilities which are staffed 24 hours a day by appropriately licensed medical providers. Any such health and elder care housing facility shall be fully integrated so that it provides recreational activities on site by virtue of open space, walking paths, a park-like setting or passive recreational activities for residents which are age-appropriate. Further, any such health and elder care housing facility shall provide library services by virtue of a reading room and some reading materials including books, newspapers, and magazines, for the use of the residents. 
    The health and elder care housing facility shall not be exempt from real estate taxation under the provisions of the Illinois Compiled Statutes, as may be amended from time-to-time. 
(1)  The developer of a health and elder care housing facility shall be exempt from making the following contributions under the Zion Code of Ordinances: 
a.  The dedication of school and park site required under section 82-156. 
b.  The donation of capital costs for the building of school facilities under section 82-157. 
c.  The library district land acquisition, capital improvement and equipment fee under section 82-158. 
d.  The city land acquisition, capital improvement and equipment fee under section 82-158. 
(2)  The developer of a health and elder care housing facility shall make the fire rescue, capital improvement and equipment fee as required under section 82-158. 
(3)  If within ten years of the first occupancy, a health and elder care housing facility no longer restricts residents to those age 60 and older, the owner of the facility, if under single ownership, or the individuals who own units, shall pay the then current developer donations as provided in the city's Code of Ordinances.

Sec. 86-200. - Definitions. 
    As used in this article the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
    Amount paid means the amount charged to the taxpayer's service address in this municipality regardless of where such amount is billed or paid. 
    Department means the Illinois Department of Revenue. 
    Gross charge means the amount paid for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this municipality and for all services and equipment provided in connection therewith by a retailer, valued in money whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits, services and property of every kind or nature, and shall be determined without any deduction on account of the cost of such telecommunications, the cost of the materials used, labor or service costs or any other expense whatsoever. In case credit is extended, the amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid. "Gross charges" for private line service shall include charges imposed at each channel termination point within this municipality and charges for the portion of the inter-office channels provided within this municipality. Charges for that portion of the inter-office channel connecting two or more channel termination points, one or more of which is located within the jurisdictional boundary of this municipality, shall be determined by the retailer by multiplying an amount equal to the total charge for the inter-office channel by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of channel termination points that are located within the jurisdictional boundary of the municipality and the denominator of which is the total number of channel termination points connected by the inter-office channel. However, "gross charge" shall not include any of the following: 
(1)  Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made pursuant to: (i) the tax imposed by this Ordinance, (ii) the tax imposed by the Telecommunications Excise Tax Act, (iii) the tax imposed by Section 4251 of the Internal Revenue Code, (iv) 911 surcharges, or (v) charges added to customers' bills pursuant to the provisions of Section 9-221 or 9-222 of the Public Utilities Act, as amended, or any similar charges added to customers' bills by retailers who are not subject to rate regulation by the Illinois Commerce Commission for the purpose of recovering any of the tax liabilities or other amounts specified in those provisions of the Public Utilities Act; 
(2)  Charges for a sent collect telecommunication received outside of such municipality; 
(3)  Charges for leased time on equipment or charges for the storage of data or information for subsequent retrieval or the processing of data or information intended to change its form or content. Such equipment includes, but is not limited to, the use of calculators, computers, data processing equipment, tabulating equipment or accounting equipment and also includes the usage of computers under a time-sharing agreement; 
(4)  Charges for customer equipment, including such equipment that is leased or rented by the customer from any source, wherein such charges are disaggregated and separately identified from other charges; 
(5)  Charges to business enterprises certified as exempt under Section 9-222.1 of the Public Utilities Act to the extent of such exemption and during the period of time specified by the department of commerce and economic opportunity; 
(6)  Charges for telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under this article has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent that the charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering such service; 
(7)  Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made); 
(8)  Charges paid by inserting coins in coin-operated telecommunication devices; or 
(9)  Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the Telecommunications Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Act; 
(10)  Charges for nontaxable services or telecommunications if (i) those charges are aggregated with other charges for telecommunications that are taxable, (ii) those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or invoice, and (iii) the retailer can reasonable identify the nontaxable charges on the retailer's books and records kept in the regular course of business. If the nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the sale of both taxable and nontaxable services of telecommunications billed on a combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or telecommunications. The burden of proving nontaxable charges shall be on the retailer of the telecommunications. 
    Interstate telecommunications means all telecommunications that either originate or terminate outside this state. 
    Intrastate telecommunications means all telecommunications that originate and terminate within this state. 
    Person means any natural individual, firm, trust, estate, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint venture, corporation, limited liability company, or a receiver, trustee, guardian, or other representative appointed by order of any court, the federal and state governments, including state universities created by statute, or any city, town, county, or other political subdivision of this state. 
    Purchase at retail means the acquisition, consumption or use of telecommunications through a sale at retail. 
    Retailer means and includes every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail as defined in this section. The department may, in its discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state. The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion. 
    Retailer maintaining a place of business in this state , or any like term, means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business, or any agent or other representative operating within this state under the authority of the retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place of business or agent or other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or whether such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this state. 
    Sale at retail means the transmitting, supplying or furnishing of telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection therewith for a consideration, to persons other than the federal and state governments, and state universities created by statute and other than between a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries for their use or consumption and not for resale. 
    Service address means the location of telecommunications equipment from which telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-ground systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent. 
    Taxpayer means a person who individually or through his or her agents, employees, or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability as authorized by the ordinance. 
    Telecommunications , in addition to the meaning ordinarily and popularly ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide area telephone service, private line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter, computer exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service, specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means, between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio, satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this article, "private line" means a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications. Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications" subject to the tax imposed under this article. For purposes of this section, "prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in Section 2-27 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act. 
(Ord. No. 12-O-4, § 2, 1-17-12) 
Sec. 86-201. - Simplified municipal telecommunications tax imposed. 
    A tax is hereby imposed upon any and all the following acts or privileges: 
(1)  The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multi-municipal taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in the municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other municipal tax. 
(2)  The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer.

Any tax required to be collected pursuant to or as authorized by this article and any such tax collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this article shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the manner provided by the department. 
(b)  Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this article shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for telecommunications.

Sec. 86-204. - Resellers. 
(a)  If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by this article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional information as the department may reasonably require. 
(b)  Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person's having discontinued the making of resales. 
(c)  Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale. 
(Ord. No. 12-O-4, § 2, 1-17-12) 
Sec. 86-205. - Severability.

a.  Except as provided in subsection (3)(c) of this section, vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown.

Sec. 97-47. - Tree replacement plan for subdivisions and new principal building construction. 
(a)  When determining the location of improvements within a subdivision and the location of structures on lots, the developer and/or builder shall make every reasonable effort to save healthy trees having a diameter of six inches or greater, measured at chest level (DBH), and other vegetation deemed appropriate by city staff. It should be recognized, however, that trees located within the interior of an improved subdivision or lot may be difficult to save due to grading, disturbance to drainage patterns, and reduction of the water table. 
(b)  (1) 
When submitting the final engineering plans for review, the developer shall submit a plat of survey certifying the location, size and species of all healthy trees having a diameter of six inches or greater DBH, for areas within 25 feet of any proposed improvement. For remaining areas within the proposed subdivision, only the general locations of the trees are required. The developer shall indicate on such plat which trees he proposes to save in accordance with this article and, in general, those trees which will be lost. The trees to be saved in accordance with this article shall be agreed upon as part of the final plat approval. 
(2)  As part of an individual lot grading plan, the builder shall show the location, size, and species of all trees having a diameter of six inches or greater DBH on that lot. The builder shall indicate on the grading plan which trees he proposes to save in accordance with this article and those trees which will be lost. Tree protection details shall be included on the plan for those trees to be saved on the lot. 
(c)  In new subdivisions trees six inches DBH or greater destroyed or removed as a result of the development of the subdivision shall be replaced. 
    In the case of a principal building being constructed on a single lot, any trees six inches DBH or greater destroyed or removed outside of the building footprint shall be replaced. 
(d)  Trees destroyed or removed as a result of the development of a subdivision or the construction of a principal building shall be subject to the replacement provisions of this chapter. 
(e)  Replacement credit for existing trees. Where the developer or the owner of a lot preserves trees located on the buildable part of the lot, such trees may be credited at 50 percent of the diameter measured at breast height and trees which are subject to credit shall be a minimum of six inches DBH or greater. 
    Trees for which a replacement credit has been given shall be identified on the landscape plan (Article VI). If tree replacement credit has been given to a developer and the subsequent lot owner removes the trees, the lot owner shall be required to replace such trees in accordance with the tree replacement standard.

(b)  Emergency removal. Where an emergency exists or where a damaged, dead or diseased tree presents an immediate safety problem to persons or property, any person may remove such tree, or the damaged portion thereof without first obtaining a tree cutting permit. Such emergency removal shall not relieve the owner of the property from his responsibility to obtain, after the fact, within ten working days, a tree cutting permit and replacement of such trees as required herein. 
(c)  Planned removal. Any developer or other person having an approved landscape plan shall at all times be entitled to a tree cutting permit for the purpose of removing trees in accordance with such plan.

Sec. 102-158. - Planned unit development. 
(a)  Purpose. The regulations contained in this section are established to encourage imaginative design of coordinated land uses and to provide relief from the subdivision and zoning district requirements which are designed for conventional developments, but which may inhibit innovation and cause undue hardship with regard to the use of parcels which present technical development problems. These regulations are further established to provide a safe and desirable living environment for residential areas characterized by a unified building and site development program, to preserve natural features of the site, and to provide adequate open space for recreation and other community purposes. 
(b)  Where permitted. A planned development may be located in any zoning district, subject to the procedures and standards set forth in this section and subsequent to the issuing of a special use permit. 
(c)  Standards may be substituted. For any planned development, the regulations and standards established in this section may be substituted for the general regulations set forth elsewhere in this chapter. 
(d)  Required sewer and water. A planned development shall be served by a sanitary sewage system and a public water supply system owned and operated by the city. 
(e)  Permitted uses. The following uses are principal (but not exclusive) uses permitted in a planned development subject to the regulations of this section: 
(1)  Single-family detached dwellings. 
(2)  Two-family dwellings, patio homes and zero lot line dwellings. 
(3)  Townhouse dwellings; provided, however, that in the R-30, R-13 and R-8 zoning districts the number of townhouse dwelling units shall not exceed 50 percent of the total number of dwelling units in the planned development. 
(4)  Multiple-family dwellings; provided, however, that in the R-30 and R-13 zoning districts the number of such units shall not exceed ten percent of the total number of units; and that in the R-8 and R-5 zoning districts the number of units shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of units; and that in the R-4 zoning district the total number of such units shall not exceed 50 percent of the total number of units in the planned development. No apartment or dwelling unit located above the first floor shall contain more than two bedrooms. 
(5)  Convenience shopping center. 
(6)  Any retail use as an integral part of a shopping center. 
(7)  Any office use. 
(8)  Any public facility use. 
(9)  Church or other place of worship. 
(10)  Any manufacturing use permitted in the L-M district subject to the standards of the L-M zone. 
(11)  Facilities for the maintenance of the planned development. 
(f)  Density standards. The basic density for a planned development shall be the same as the zone in which the development is located, with the following exceptions: 
(1)  The following density is hereby established for each of the residential zones. 
District Density R-30  1.4 du/ac R-16  2.7 du/ac R-13  3.4 du/ac R-10  4.3 du/ac R-8  5.4 du/ac R-5  5.4 du/ac R-4  8.0 du/ac R-2 12 du/ac  
(2)  All density calculations shall be based on the gross site area or each part thereof lying in a separate zoning district. 
(3)  Where the proposed planned development contains 20 percent or more of the gross site as dedicated public open space, the density permitted, expressed in dwelling units per acre, may be increased by two dwelling units per acre. 
(4)  The permitted number of dwelling units in a planned development shall be calculated by multiplying the gross site area by the density established for the zoning district plus the open space bonus provided for in subsection (f)(3) of this section. Where the proposed planned development includes land in more than one zone the number of units shall be calculated separately for each zone and added together to determine the total number of units. 
(g)  Minimum site area. The minimum land use to be included in a planned development shall be four acres. 
(h)  Design standards. The development plan shall be prepared by professional persons: Architects, city planners, engineers, landscape architects and surveyors. The benefits of the planned development and the improved design of the development must justify the intended variation from the normal requirements of this chapter. In preparing the development plan, particular consideration shall be given to the following: 
(1)  The provision of open space for recreational and other outdoor benefits and activities. Recreational open space which qualifies for additional density units as provided above shall be landscaped and improved with recreational facilities appropriate to the proposed development; specifically, adequate play areas for children shall be provided in all planned developments containing single-family dwellings, two-family dwellings and townhouse dwellings. At a minimum, 15 percent of the gross site shall be developed for active or passive recreation. 
(2)  The conservation of significant natural features of the site such as floodplains, wetlands, forests, scenic areas and vistas. All such areas shall be considered recreational open space. 
(3)  Maximum separation of vehicular traffic from pedestrian ways and play areas. 
(4)  A unified design based upon significant architectural features, compatible building materials and a distinctive arrangement of structures and open spaces. 
(5)  The provision of adequate sites for retail shipping and service areas, schools, places of worship and other community services where the development is large enough to support these services. 
(6)  The relationship of the development to surrounding uses and property. 
(7)  Surface drainage and stormwater detention facilities shall be designed so that the runoff from the developed site shall not exceed the runoff from the site in its natural state during a storm of two-year frequency as published by the U.S. Weather Bureau for the Chicago area. The capacity of stormwater detention facilities shall be based on a storm of 100-year frequency and the runoff coefficient for the fully developed planned development less the volume of water released based on a storm of two-year frequency and the runoff coefficient of the site in its natural state. 
(8)  There shall be two parking spaces per dwelling unit. For all other uses the parking requirements of article IV of this chapter shall apply. Where a planned development is designed to provide for the joint use of parking the total requirement may be reduced by an amount equal to the joint use established, provided that all multiple-family dwellings shall have at least one parking space for the exclusive use of the dwelling. 
(9)  All streets and street improvements shall be designed by a registered professional engineer. The width of streets and the design of the pavement and other structures shall be based upon their intended use and shall be related to the overall design of the planned development. Any street dedicated to the public shall be designed and constructed to the standards of chapter 82 of this Code. 
(10)  All structures located on the perimeter of a planned development shall be set back from the property line or street right-of-way a distance equal to the required setback in the adjacent zone. Interior yards and setbacks shall be in conformity with good site planning practices. 
(11)  Any structure within a planned development may be 35 feet in height. Any structure may exceed 35 feet in height, provided it does not exceed a height determined by a plane extending inward from the perimeter of the planned development at an angle 30 degrees above the horizontal; provided that no structure shall exceed a height of 50 feet. 
(12)  All streets dedicated to the public shall be provided with streetlights in accordance with the standards of chapter 82. Private streets and parking areas shall be lighted in a similar manner, provided however, that ornamental standards and fixtures may be permitted. 
(i)  Preapplication for a planned development. Before submitting an application for a planned development, the developer is required to hold a preplanning conference, and to present sketch plans to the plan commission. The purpose of these presentations shall be to inform the commission of the proposed development and the manner in which it has been planned to take advantage of the regulations of this section. The plan commission shall have 30 days in which to make any suggestions or recommendation to the developer prior to the filing of an application. Once the preapplication procedure is completed the application shall be made in writing and shall be accompanied by a general development plan. 
(j)  Application and general development plan. The general development plan shall include the following:

c.  The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality.

(4)  The zoning board of appeals may recommend to the city council that this chapter be amended in a manner specified by the board. 
(5)  The zoning board of appeals may recommend to the city council that no zoning change be granted. 
The concurring vote of four members of the zoning board of appeals shall be necessary to take any of the above actions.

(e)  Board opinion. The zoning board of appeals shall prepare a written opinion regarding each action taken, stating: 
(1)  Its recommendations as to the requested zoning change, together with an explanation of why a particular form of zoning change is desirable. 
(2)  All findings of fact setting forth in detail the specific reasons why the recommendation is made in this case. 
(3)  Where the grant of variation or special use permit is recommended, its recommendation as to the imposition of conditions and restrictions. 
Any or all members of the zoning board of appeals who do not concur in the recommendation of the majority of the board may prepare a written dissenting opinion, to be clearly captioned as such. Such advisory opinion and dissenting opinion shall be promptly delivered to the city council and the applicant. 
(f)  Action by city council. Upon receipt of the zoning board of appeals' opinion on any request for zoning change, the city council shall thereupon consider such matter in the ordinary course of its business and procedure. The council may grant a variation or special use permit by ordinance, and may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation or a special use permit as may be necessary to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such variation or special use permit upon other property in the neighborhood, or the council may amend this chapter in such a way as to grant the specific relief requested by the applicant; provided, however, that if the amendment will significantly affect property outside the immediate neighborhood of the property which is the subject of the application, the council shall schedule a further public hearing on the proposed amendment under the regulations provided in section 102-237. 
(g)  Period of validity. No variation or special use permit granted by the city council shall be valid for a period longer than 180 days from the date of the ordinance granting such variation or special use permit, unless within such 180-day period:

(2)  A use is commenced. 
The city council may grant additional extensions not exceeding 180 days each, upon written application, without notice or hearing. 
(h)  Standards for special use permits. No special use permit shall be granted unless: 
(1)  The special use is a use designated by this chapter as permitted in the applicable district upon the issuance of a special use permit. 
(2)  The special use complies with all applicable bulk regulations and general standards of this chapter. 
(3)  The special use at the location is necessary for the public convenience. 
(4)  The location and size of the special use, the nature and intensity of the operation involved in or conducted in connection with it, and the location of the site with respect to streets giving access to it, shall be such that it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the district in which it is located. 
(5)  The location, nature and height of buildings, walls, and fences, and the nature and extent of the landscaping on the site shall be such that the use will not unreasonably hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings. 
(6)  Parking areas shall be of adequate size for the particular use, properly located, and the entrance and exit drives shall be laid out so as to prevent traffic hazards and nuisances. 
(7)  The special use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood in which it is to be situated. 
(i)  Standards for planned development variation. No planned development variation shall be granted unless: 
(1)  The property for which the variation is granted exceeds five acres in size, and the size of the property makes it necessary that the regulations of this chapter be varied in such a manner that will promote the most efficient and economical use of the property. 
(2)  To the extent that any planned development permits a use not otherwise permitted by this chapter, the city council shall specifically set forth in the ordinance granting such planned development variation the reasons why the proposed use is necessary to provide a service or facility which is in the interest of public convenience and which will not be detrimental to persons or property in the vicinity. 
(3)  To the extent that any planned development permits a reduction in the bulk regulations which would otherwise be applicable, the city council shall specifically set forth in the ordinance granting such planned development variation the advantages to the public resulting from the planned development which will outweigh any injury to the public which may result from the reduction of the bulk regulations.

Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is obscene. 
(Ord. No. 05-O-13, § 1, 5-17-05) 
Sec. 102-312. - Findings. 
    Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses presented to the municipality from findings incorporated in the cases of City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 120 S.Ct. 1382 (2000); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. , 501 U.S. 560 (1991), City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc. , 475 U.S. 41 (1986) Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), Berg v. Health and Hospital Corporation, 865 F.2d 797 (7th Cir 1989); Ellwest Stereo Theaters v. Wenner, 681 F.2d 1243 (9th Cir. 1982); Bamon Corp v. City of Dayton , 730 F.Supp 80 (S.D. Ohio, 1990) and EWAP Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 97 Cal. App 3d 179, 158 Cal. Rptr. (1979), and on studies in other cities including the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (Minnesota, 1989); Memorandum re: Adult Entertainment Ordinance , of the Assistant Chief of Police of the Tucson, Arizona (May 1, 1990); Hecht, Peter R., Ph.D., Report to the American Center for Law and Justice on the Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses (March 31, 1996); Adult Entertainment Businesses in Indianapolis, An Analysis (1984) and McCleary, Richard, Ph.D. and Meeker, James W., Ph.D., Final Report to the City of Garden Grove: The Relationship Between Crime and Adult Business Operations on Garden Grove Boulevard , (Garden Grove, CA, October 23, 1991), this Legislative body finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities. 
(2)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral sex and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually oriented entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
(3)  Studies conducted in other cities have demonstrated a correlation between sexually oriented business and a decrease in the residential and commercial property values that surround them, especially those properties within 1,000 feet of such businesses. 
(4)  Studies conducted in other cities have demonstrated a correlation between sexually oriented businesses and increased crime in the neighborhood, including sex-related crimes like prostitution, obscenity, and sexual assault. This correlation is especially acute when more than one sexually oriented business is located in a neighborhood, and when a sexually oriented business is located near a public open space such as a park, cemetery or school. 
(5)  Studies conducted in other cities have demonstrated a correlation between sexually oriented businesses and increased harassment and propositioning of women, children and the elderly in the neighborhood. 
(6)  Studies conducted in other cities have demonstrated a correlation between sexually oriented businesses and offensive material such as pornographic magazines and used condoms being discarded in the surrounding neighborhood, making them available to children. 
(7)  Location of sexually oriented business in a neighborhood can create a "sex for sale" reputation in a neighborhood. 
(8)  The foregoing findings raise substantial governmental interests and concerns. 
(9)  The municipality cannot entirely prohibit sexually oriented businesses that are not obscene from locating within the municipality. 
(10)  The municipality can effect reasonable locational regulations which it believes will ameliorate these deleterious secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses. 
(11)  Locating sexually oriented businesses in an industrial zone will ameliorate these deleterious secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses. 
(12)  Requiring sexually oriented businesses to be located 1,000 feet from any other sexually oriented businesses will ameliorate these deleterious secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses. 
(13)  Requiring sexually oriented businesses to be located 1,000 feet from any school, day care center, cemetery, public park including any lineal recreational area like a bike path, public housing, place of religious worship, lot zoned for residential purposes and lot used for residential purposes, complies with the requirements of state law 65 ILCS 5/11-5-1.5, and will ameliorate these deleterious secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses. 
(14)  Sheridan Road, Lewis Avenue, Green Bay Road, and State Route 173 are the main thoroughfares in the municipality, and more than any other locations in the municipality reflect on the economic status of the municipality. 
(15)  Accordingly, a decrease in the property values and an increase in visible crime along these thoroughfares will affect the property values of the municipality as a whole in a way that other locations would not. 
(16)  Preventing sexually oriented businesses from locating directly on, or within 500 feet of Sheridan Road, Lewis Avenue, Green Bay Road, and State Route 173 will help to conserve property values in the municipality as a whole, while still providing an adequate number of sites and acreage available for the location of sexually oriented businesses. 
(17)  At the time this article was approved, the regulations set forth herein permitted approximately 48.25 acres available for sexually oriented businesses in the municipality.

ARTICLE XI. - PERSONAL WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES 

Sec. 102-401. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to provide specific regulations for the placement, construction and modification of personal wireless telecommunications facilities. In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and businesses while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the community, the city council finds that these regulations are necessary in order to: 
(1)  Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunications services to the residents and visitors of the city, as well as to other persons, firms, and/or corporations in the vicinity of the city; 
(2)  Minimize adverse visual effects of towers, antennas and related structures and equipment, through careful design, siting, screening, and landscape buffering standards; 
(3)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from falling ice and tower failure through structural standards and setback requirements; 
(4)  Promote, encourage and maximize the shared use of existing and approved towers and buildings to accommodate new wireless telecommunication antennas in order to reduce the number of towers needed to serve the community; and 
(5)  Promote, encourage and maximize the use of existing tall structures that have been established for public utility purposes within the community. 
(Ord. No. 11-O-58A, § I, 12-6-11) 
Sec. 102-402. - Interpretation. 
(a)  The provisions of this chapter are not intended to and shall not be interpreted or applied so as to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, nor shall the provisions of this chapter be applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services. To the extent that any provision or provisions of this article are inconsistent or in conflict with any provision of this Code, the provisions of this article shall be deemed to control. 
(b)  In the course of reviewing any request for any approval required under this article made by an applicant to provide personal wireless service or to install personal wireless service facilities, the city council shall act within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed with the city, taking into account the nature and scope of the request. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a reasonable period of time to take final action on applications for collocated facilities is 90 days and for new facilities 150 days; provided that such period shall be tolled during any time the applicant needs to respond to reasonable requests for additional information. Any decision to deny such a request shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. 
(c)  No decision to deny an application for a special use permit or a zoning variation for the construction or installation of a personal wireless service facility may be based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facility complies with the FCC's regulations concerning such emissions. 
(Ord. No. 11-O-58A, § I, 12-6-11) 
Sec. 102-403. - Definitions. 
    The terms "personal wireless service" and "personal wireless service facilities", as used in this chapter, shall be defined in the same manner as in Title 47, United States Code, Section 332(c)(7)(C), as amended now or in the future. Generally, these terms refer to licensed commercial wireless telecommunication services including cellular, personal communication services (PCS), specialized mobile radio (SMR), enhanced specialized mobile radio (ESMR), paging, and similar services that are marketed to the general public. For the purpose of this chapter the term "personal wireless service facilities" includes each of its component parts, including ground-mounted support equipment, screening, landscaping, towers and/or antennae, as deemed appropriate in the context, and any other appurtenant improvements required as a condition of authority to construct such facilities. 
(Ord. No. 11-O-58A, § I, 12-6-11) 
Sec. 102-404. - Placement of personal wireless service facilities. 
(a)  Personal wireless service facilities shall be considered a special use only (i) in the H-B and H-B(2) Business Districts, (ii) in each Industrial District, (iii) attached to or otherwise similarly closely integrated with tall structures established for public utility purposes in any zoning district, and (iv) for antennas attached to existing buildings of five stories or more located within any district. 
(b)  Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, the permitted height for any personal wireless service facilities shall be not more than 50 percent higher than the maximum height allowed in the zoning district where it is to be located. Antennas attached to existing buildings of five stories or more located within any district may extend not more than 15 feet above the highest point of the roof of the building to which it is attached. 
(c)  A personal wireless service facility, including related electronic equipment and structures, shall require a special use permit. A personal wireless service facility shall require a zoning variation for any portion of the height of the personal wireless service facility in excess of the permitted height described in paragraph (b). 
(Ord. No. 11-O-58A, § I, 12-6-11) 
Sec. 102-405. - City-owned land. 
(a)  Exemption. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any application for placement, construction and modification of personal wireless telecommunications facilities on city-owned real property shall be exempt from the requirement to obtain either a special use or variance, it being hereby declared to be the policy and intent of the city that personal wireless telecommunications facilities are to be considered permitted uses on city-owned real property, subject to the order of priority described in paragraph (b). 
(b)  Priority of users. For wireless telecommunication antennas and towers, priority for the use of city-owned land will be given to the following entities and purposes in descending order:

(Ord. No. 11-O-58A, § I, 12-6-11) 
Sec. 102-406. - Preference for shared use. 
(a)  The shared use of existing towers and antenna facilities ("Collocation") shall be preferred to the construction of new facilities. Provided that such shared use is accomplished in a manner consistent with the terms of this chapter, then applications for collocation facilities may be approved administratively without any new or additional special use permit approval. Proper plans must be submitted and permits obtained for such collocation facilities as required by the terms of this article. 
(b)  An applicant for a special use permit for a new tower or support structure shall submit a report inventorying existing towers and antenna sites within a reasonable distance from the proposed site, not less than one-half mile, outlining opportunities for shared use as an alternative to the proposed use. The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed tower or antenna cannot be accommodated on an existing approved tower or facility due to one or more of the following reasons: 
(1)  Refusal of the owner to entertain the proposed facility. 
(2)  The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of existing and approved towers and facilities, considering existing and approved uses for those facilities. 
(3)  The planned equipment would cause interference with other existing or approved equipment, which cannot reasonably be prevented. 
(4)  Existing or approved towers or facilities do not have space on which proposed equipment can be placed so it can function effectively and reasonably. 
(c)  The city council may consider existing towers and antenna sites located within a reasonable distance of city boundaries in adjacent municipalities and unincorporated areas that are capable of serving the city when examining an application for an additional new facility. 
(Ord. No. 11-O-58A, § I, 12-6-11) 
Sec. 102-407. - Conditions. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this article, the personal wireless service facility shall be designed to conform and be maintained in compliance with all applicable federal laws and regulations concerning its use and operation, and shall also conform to and be maintained in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Zoning Code and all other applicable provisions of the Municipal Code of the City of Zion, Illinois, including but not limited to chapter 10 (buildings and building regulations) thereof. Any zoning authority granted under this article shall not relieve the applicant from obtaining any building permit as required by law, provided that like-kind substitution or replacement of antennas and other appurtenances to the personal wireless service facility shall require a building permit or any amendment to the zoning authority granted hereunder. 
(b)  Towers and all other structures and equipment involved with a personal wireless service facility shall be located in compliance with the following: 
(1)  Setbacks. 
a.  Shall not be located between the front lot line and the principal building, if any, on the site.

c.  Except for collocated facilities, all new personal wireless service facilities shall be separated from other existing personal wireless service facilities by at least 750 feet. 
(2)  Departures from the above standards shall be considered as part of a special use permit and/or variation application for (i) facilities proposed to be attached to or otherwise similarly closely integrated with tall structures established for public utility purposes, and (ii) facilities proposed in conjunction with buildings of five stories or more located within any district. 
(c)  In considering a request for approval of a special use and/or variance to permit the installation of personal wireless service facilities, the city council shall, in addition to other relevant standards for approval, also give due consideration and weight to: 
(1)  Whether each applicant has sought and been denied the opportunity to co-locate its personal wireless service facility on an existing antenna supporting structure. 
(2)  Whether a significant gap in coverage exists in each applicant's coverage area for the provision of personal wireless telecommunications service. A "gap in coverage" exists when a remote user of such services is unable to either connect with the land-based national telephone network or to maintain a connection capable of supporting a reasonably uninterrupted communication. This standard shall be applied separately to each personal wireless communications service provider and shall not require "five bars" or other equivalent measurement of the highest quality service. 
(3)  Whether the means chosen to fill a significant gap in coverage are the least intrusive on the conditions set forth in this chapter. 
(4)  Whether there are specific and unique aesthetic, visual and safety objections relative to such application and/or the subject property, either in isolation or cumulatively, that are distinct from those generalized concerns otherwise addressed in this chapter. 
(5)  Whether the proposed site would encroach in a historically-significant area. 
(Ord. No. 11-O-58A, § I, 12-6-11) 
Sec. 102-408. - Nonconformities. 
    Any personal wireless service facility installed and operating prior to the enactment of this chapter which would be prohibited under this chapter shall be considered to be legal nonconforming uses and/or legal nonconforming structures, as the case may be, and shall be subject to the rules on nonconforming uses and structures as provided by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 11-O-58A, § I, 12-6-11) 
Sec. 102-409. - Tower and antenna design requirements.

(1)  When the city believes a facility has been abandoned, the director of building shall cause a notice of facility abandonment to be sent via first class mail to the last known address of the applicant and owner and taxpayer, according to the records of the Zion Township Assessor. The notice of facility abandonment shall state the name and address of the applicant, the name and address of the owner, a summary of the grounds for the city's determination and describe the opportunity for a hearing. 
(2)  Failure to request a hearing within 21 days from the date of the notice will result in the city council making its determination solely on the basis of evidence presented by the city staff. 
(3)  A person may challenge the validity of the notice of facility abandonment by requesting a hearing and appearing in person to submit evidence which would conclusively disprove abandonment or the term for which the facility has not been used or operated. Upon a request for a hearing, the director of building shall schedule the hearing for a city council meeting. 
(4)  All interested parties shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present testimony and evidence at the hearing. Motions for continuances of the hearing date must be made in person before the city council and may be granted upon a showing of good cause. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing. 
(c)  Written notice of the council's determination of abandonment shall be sent via regular mail, and via certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of the tower(s) and associated facilities and to the applicant for the special use permit. 
(d)  Decommissioning and restoration plan. 
(1)  Prior to receiving a building permit and/or special use permit for the construction of a personal wireless telecommunication facility, the owner and/or operator must include a decommissioning and restoration plan with the application to ensure such facility and all related equipment is properly decommissioned. The owner of the facility and the underlying property owner(s) shall be jointly liable for the removal of all equipment associated with the facility at the end of the special use permit period, if any, the useful life of the facility, or when the facility is abandoned as herein described. The decommissioning and restoration plan shall provide:
